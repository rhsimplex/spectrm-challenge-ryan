c21078 +++$+++ Hey, Sam, bet ya two bucks ya lose.
c21078 +++$+++ Shit, man, tha' ain't even worth considerin'.
c21078 +++$+++ How 'bout twenty?
c21078 +++$+++ Now you talkin'.
c21078 +++$+++ Bet!
c21078 +++$+++ You're a witness, Doc!
c20002 +++$+++ His name was Jimmy.
c20002 +++$+++ What happened?
c20002 +++$+++ Who did he go to meet?
c14402 +++$+++ For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
c14402 +++$+++ I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
c14402 +++$+++ I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
c11884 +++$+++ Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
c11884 +++$+++ But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
c11884 +++$+++ My guess is that she turned him down.
c11884 +++$+++ But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
c11884 +++$+++ Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
c02022 +++$+++ Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
c02022 +++$+++ So we should "wait and see." For how long?
c02022 +++$+++ I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
c02022 +++$+++ Fine. That's all there is to it then.
c02022 +++$+++ No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
c02022 +++$+++ It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
c08771 +++$+++ Yeah.
c08771 +++$+++ That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
c08771 +++$+++ No dog.
c08771 +++$+++ I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
c08771 +++$+++ No dog.
c08771 +++$+++ Very nice.
c23806 +++$+++ Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.
c23806 +++$+++ Yeah.  I heard you.
c23806 +++$+++ Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
c00221 +++$+++ You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
c00221 +++$+++ That's the way I see it, too.
c00221 +++$+++ Call me later.
c00221 +++$+++ Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
c02731 +++$+++ You know you don't have to do this.
c02731 +++$+++ I'm fine, I really am.
c02731 +++$+++ I admire your strength.
c02731 +++$+++ Right.
c26167 +++$+++ Great movie. Action-packed!
c26167 +++$+++ Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
c26167 +++$+++ Sonny kicks ass.
c26167 +++$+++ You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
c26167 +++$+++ If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
c26167 +++$+++ My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
c26167 +++$+++ Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
c26167 +++$+++ That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
c16284 +++$+++ Yah, real good. How you doin'?
c16284 +++$+++ Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.  You're damned hard to get on the phone.
c16284 +++$+++ Yah, it's pretty darned busy here, but that's the way we like it.
c16284 +++$+++ That's for sure. Now, I just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, I can't read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so I -
c16284 +++$+++ But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
c16284 +++$+++ Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
c16284 +++$+++ Yah, so we're all set.
c16284 +++$+++ Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
c16284 +++$+++ But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
c16284 +++$+++ Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
c16284 +++$+++ Yah, well, they exist all right.
c16284 +++$+++ I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
c16284 +++$+++ Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
c16284 +++$+++ No, fax is no good, that's what I have and I can't read the darn thing -
c16284 +++$+++ Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
c16284 +++$+++ Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
c16284 +++$+++ Yah, how much money was that?
c16284 +++$+++ Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
c16284 +++$+++ Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
c16284 +++$+++ No, no, fax is -
c16284 +++$+++ I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
c16284 +++$+++ Okay, real good, then.
c22297 +++$+++ Alright, it's done.
c22297 +++$+++ You see the bullet?
c22297 +++$+++ Good.  Now take the forceps, and remember, Vincent, what we're doing here is routine.  I've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field.  There are no vital organs where you're working, no major muscles or arteries -- you can't kill me.  Just make sure you've got the bullet before you try to pull it out.
c05669 +++$+++ We get the games on the radio sometimes.
c05669 +++$+++ We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
c05669 +++$+++ You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
c05669 +++$+++ Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
c05669 +++$+++ You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
c05669 +++$+++ Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
c05669 +++$+++ There are ways around that. Right sergeant?
c24125 +++$+++ Welcome to the show, Scooby.
c24125 +++$+++ Thank you.
c24125 +++$+++ Nice to have you here.
c24125 +++$+++ Great to be here.
c24125 +++$+++ And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
c24125 +++$+++ Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
c24125 +++$+++ Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
c24125 +++$+++ TV talk-show host, OK. You were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then TV talk-show host. You'll be a Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
c04103 +++$+++ I was driven out.
c04103 +++$+++ And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
c04103 +++$+++ First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
c26937 +++$+++ She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
c26937 +++$+++ How do you know it's a she?
c26937 +++$+++ I saw her in the water.  Beside me.  She was filling the bathtub.
c26937 +++$+++ What does she look like?
c26937 +++$+++ Pretty.  She's a blond.
c26937 +++$+++ Do you have any idea who she is?
c26937 +++$+++ Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
c26937 +++$+++ What do you think I should do?
c24364 +++$+++ I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
c24364 +++$+++ It is not.  Get out.
c24364 +++$+++ I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
c24364 +++$+++ Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
c02845 +++$+++ They just caught the man who did it.
c02845 +++$+++ He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
c02845 +++$+++ Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
c11067 +++$+++ But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
c11067 +++$+++ It's only one picture deal.
c11067 +++$+++ Yeah. They keep you under drugs out there with armed guards...
c06872 +++$+++ Where'd you come from?
c06872 +++$+++ San Diego.
c06872 +++$+++ Oh, San Diego? I've thought about moving to San Diego.  It's hard to make a living in this town. These short hops.  Can't make a dime on 'em. To LAX, Pasadena, then I can make a buck. These little hops cost me money.
c06872 +++$+++ Sorry.
c06872 +++$+++ 'S okay. What do you think?
c06872 +++$+++ Huh?
c06872 +++$+++ Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
c06872 +++$+++ Aw, too bad.
c22650 +++$+++ What's on the other end of this thing?
c22650 +++$+++ Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
c22650 +++$+++ Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
c16866 +++$+++ I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
c16866 +++$+++ I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
c16866 +++$+++ No.
c07200 +++$+++ I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
c07200 +++$+++ BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
c07200 +++$+++ IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
c07200 +++$+++ I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
c24460 +++$+++ Sonofagun! Look at this here!
c24460 +++$+++ First paycheck?
c24460 +++$+++ First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
c24460 +++$+++ I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80! I want it now, man, while I'm still young and cool.
c14338 +++$+++ Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
c14338 +++$+++ A page-break signal.  A period.
c14338 +++$+++ Not if you think like a Vegan.
c14338 +++$+++ -- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission.  Heaven is the mustard seed.
c09883 +++$+++ What's your name?
c09883 +++$+++ Alexander.
c09883 +++$+++ Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
c09883 +++$+++ You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
c09883 +++$+++ No, we created the Morlocks.
c09883 +++$+++ Created?
c09883 +++$+++ You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
c09883 +++$+++ To work the machines and build the tunnels.  You can't imagine what it was like when it all started.  We survived for millennia, scraping the lichen and microscopic organisms from the rock with our teeth and digging for water with our nails.  Endlessly.  For generations.  And we... became.
c08331 +++$+++ Plenty of room for two people.
c08331 +++$+++ It'll just be me.
c08331 +++$+++ Student?
c08331 +++$+++ No.  You said three-fifty?
c08331 +++$+++ Plus first and last month deposit.
c08331 +++$+++ Will you lease month-to-month?
c08331 +++$+++ How about for five hundred?
c04870 +++$+++ Hi.
c04870 +++$+++ Tough day.
c04870 +++$+++ My sympathies.
c04870 +++$+++ Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
c04870 +++$+++ We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, Jim.
c04870 +++$+++ I don't know what to say except I'm sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on my mind.
c04870 +++$+++ I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
c04870 +++$+++ I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
c04870 +++$+++ It's going to get worse, honey.
c25654 +++$+++ Yes.
c25654 +++$+++ My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
c25654 +++$+++ I can't understand.  The sedatives....
c13240 +++$+++ Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
c13240 +++$+++ Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
c13240 +++$+++ Oh, OK.
c13240 +++$+++ Walter you look awful pale! What did you have to eat today?
c13240 +++$+++ I had a salami sandwich, Mrs. Swicker.
c13240 +++$+++ Oh no, that's OK, I can fix myself something.  Besides, I got something important to do...
c19074 +++$+++ Where?  Where?
c19074 +++$+++ Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
c19074 +++$+++ Can you confirm visually or just radar?
c19074 +++$+++ Okay.  Lead him in.  Okay, everybody up on the trucks. We aim for the stomach or side... there's little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  <u>Everybody</u> <u>up</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>trucks</u>.
c25618 +++$+++ Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
c25618 +++$+++ Just...want to be ready when we do.
c25618 +++$+++ The photos.
c07453 +++$+++ Don't touch him.
c07453 +++$+++ How many men have we seen die?
c07453 +++$+++ Two.  Gabriel and Thomas.
c07453 +++$+++ They're gone.  And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
c07453 +++$+++ No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
c05438 +++$+++ Your father?
c05438 +++$+++ He's plastered.
c05438 +++$+++ No it's not.  He should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of Johnny Walker.  He's never been there for me.  I've always been alone.
c09327 +++$+++ Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
c09327 +++$+++ They're all criminals?
c09327 +++$+++ No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
c09327 +++$+++ "Gone live?"
c09327 +++$+++ Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
c09327 +++$+++ This is some serious shit.
c09327 +++$+++ Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
c09327 +++$+++ You got a point there.
c09327 +++$+++ People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
c09327 +++$+++ I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
c09327 +++$+++ I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
c09327 +++$+++ And one other thing.
c09327 +++$+++ Sex.
c10998 +++$+++ Hey, can you guys hear me?
c10998 +++$+++ Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
c10998 +++$+++ Can't talk now; Broussard's injured. We'll need some help getting him into the ship.
c20387 +++$+++ What did you say?
c20387 +++$+++ I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
c20387 +++$+++ Do you know who you address, sir?
c20387 +++$+++ The future King!
c22979 +++$+++ Futterman!...He's got a little tradin' post on the South Fork o' the Brazos...Laurie, I just got to get me a good horse! Think yer pa would...
c22979 +++$+++ Finish your breakfast...
c22979 +++$+++ I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
c22979 +++$+++ But that's Sweet-face -- your own good horse.
c20337 +++$+++ Now what happens?
c20337 +++$+++ Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
c20337 +++$+++ Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
c20970 +++$+++ Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
c20970 +++$+++ Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
c20970 +++$+++ Okay -- fine.
c20970 +++$+++ But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
c20970 +++$+++ No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
c20970 +++$+++ You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
c20970 +++$+++ If that's all right.
c20970 +++$+++ I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
c20970 +++$+++ Okay.
c10392 +++$+++ He was accused of jury tampering.
c10392 +++$+++ Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
c10392 +++$+++ Four cases in three years...
c10392 +++$+++ The man's an ambulance chaser...
c10392 +++$+++ ...tell me about this case.
c10392 +++$+++ This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
c10392 +++$+++ No -- we don't want this case in court.
c10392 +++$+++ Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
c10392 +++$+++ I want to settle this thing and be done with it. I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
c10392 +++$+++ No. Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
c10392 +++$+++ All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
c23903 +++$+++ I can't see!  How can I fight?
c23903 +++$+++ Try to feel it.  Use the Force...
c23903 +++$+++ Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
c25035 +++$+++ You said you weren't coming?
c25035 +++$+++ I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
c25035 +++$+++ What did you find?
c25035 +++$+++ Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
c25035 +++$+++ That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
c01514 +++$+++ Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
c01514 +++$+++ No.
c01514 +++$+++ Thank-Q!
c01514 +++$+++ Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
c01514 +++$+++ I think it's the eyes.
c01514 +++$+++ The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
c01514 +++$+++ Watching television in color.
c01514 +++$+++ Cross my heart and hope to die.
c13902 +++$+++ ...Well, it didn't make him happy...
c13902 +++$+++ But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
c13902 +++$+++ Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
c26819 +++$+++ ...hell of a price for the country to pay.
c26819 +++$+++ ...take a long view.
c26819 +++$+++ ...what's the Long View?
c26819 +++$+++ Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.
c26819 +++$+++ Wilfred.  We've got <u>work</u> to do...
c21821 +++$+++ Where's Fezzik?
c21821 +++$+++ I thought he was with you.
c21821 +++$+++ In that case --
c20439 +++$+++ Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
c20439 +++$+++ You have no time.  What is your question?
c20439 +++$+++ You have no time.
c24667 +++$+++ Susie, whatever problems you have with J.J. - I didn't invent them! What're you blaming me for?  If you learned to let out your hatred you would be better off!
c24667 +++$+++ Like you?
c24667 +++$+++ Yeah!  Like me!  I don't choke on my own gall - I fight back!  Let THEM choke, not me!
c24667 +++$+++ I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
c24667 +++$+++ I know that bit - you're a girl; you need a man to give you strength! So what do you pick such weak sisters for?  Don't you know yet that you fight fire with fire, not with tear drops?
c24667 +++$+++ I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
c24667 +++$+++ ...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
c26399 +++$+++ That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
c26399 +++$+++ And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
c26399 +++$+++ "Arkady"
c26399 +++$+++ Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
c26399 +++$+++ ...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
c26399 +++$+++ No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
c26399 +++$+++ With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
c23423 +++$+++ You scared me.
c23423 +++$+++ I didn't aim to.
c23423 +++$+++ No ma'am.
c02149 +++$+++ It didn't go off.
c02149 +++$+++ Oh, God...
c02149 +++$+++ Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
c00667 +++$+++ How old are you?
c00667 +++$+++ That's not really a very proper question.
c00667 +++$+++ How old are you?
c00667 +++$+++ Twenty-eight.
c00667 +++$+++ I'm twenty-seven.
c00667 +++$+++ I know.
c00667 +++$+++ Now what do you want to talk about?
c00667 +++$+++ Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
c00667 +++$+++ My best friend. My very best friend.
c00667 +++$+++ Shall I read to you?
c00667 +++$+++ What? Oh, yes, please.
c00667 +++$+++ A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
c00667 +++$+++ Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
c25157 +++$+++ I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
c25157 +++$+++ Who told you that?
c25157 +++$+++ No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse...
c14417 +++$+++ They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
c14417 +++$+++ He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
c14417 +++$+++ What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
c14417 +++$+++ I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
c14417 +++$+++ They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
c14417 +++$+++ It's not chronological: Son of Sam was before Hillside.
c16522 +++$+++ I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
c16522 +++$+++ Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
c16522 +++$+++ What would I do with it? Run amok?
c00286 +++$+++ Celebrity Films.
c00286 +++$+++ Eddie.
c00286 +++$+++ Yeah, who's this?
c00286 +++$+++ I know what you did.
c00286 +++$+++ What?
c00286 +++$+++ I know what you did.
c00286 +++$+++ Who is this.
c00286 +++$+++ You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
c00286 +++$+++ You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
c07078 +++$+++ Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee behind the store this morning.
c07078 +++$+++ I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I swear, I ... didn't smoke.
c07078 +++$+++ I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
c07078 +++$+++ Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
c07078 +++$+++ So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
c07078 +++$+++ I expect more from thee, Richard.
c10568 +++$+++ Hey!!!... Johnnie Farragut. How are you, my man.
c10568 +++$+++ Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
c10568 +++$+++ Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
c10568 +++$+++ No... She's fine. Back home.
c10568 +++$+++ Set one up.
c21026 +++$+++ Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
c21026 +++$+++ Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
c21026 +++$+++ But you have no proof.
c21026 +++$+++ No, Miss Ratched...
c21026 +++$+++ And yet you suspect her.
c21026 +++$+++ Yes, that is correct.
c21026 +++$+++ Why?
c21026 +++$+++ Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
c20828 +++$+++ So you're courtin' the preacher's girl. Well, just watch your step, boy, or he'll preach you right into hell.  I'm counting on you, Reverend.
c20828 +++$+++ I understand.
c20828 +++$+++ Wouldn't do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
c20828 +++$+++ I know.
c20828 +++$+++ That'll make the folks very happy.
c03389 +++$+++ Where have you been?
c03389 +++$+++ Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
c03389 +++$+++ You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
c03389 +++$+++ Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
c03389 +++$+++ The fans of Narcissus.  They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
c12859 +++$+++ Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
c12859 +++$+++ I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
c12859 +++$+++ I doubt that.
c12859 +++$+++ Why?
c12859 +++$+++ Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
c12859 +++$+++ What's he like?
c02107 +++$+++ You're my prisoner.
c02107 +++$+++ I've got something to tell you.
c02107 +++$+++ I want to hear it.
c02107 +++$+++ What job?
c22171 +++$+++ Make your teeth yella --
c22171 +++$+++ I like yella teeth.
c22171 +++$+++ Maybe I like garbage.
c10498 +++$+++ A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
c10498 +++$+++ Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
c10498 +++$+++ Really?
c10498 +++$+++ You really think Dylan's okay?
c27417 +++$+++ Isn't it true that Darwin preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case until, by some extraordinary means, it actually began to move with voluntary motion?
c27417 +++$+++ A piece of what?
c27417 +++$+++ Are you speaking of the worm, or ... the spaghetti.
c24303 +++$+++ You know, my mom has this saying.
c24303 +++$+++ Yeah?
c24303 +++$+++ Really? What else does your mother say?
c02467 +++$+++ Come over after I'm done here?
c02467 +++$+++ I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
c02467 +++$+++ I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
c18697 +++$+++ This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
c18697 +++$+++ Thank Christ we got a witness.
c18697 +++$+++ <u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
c01402 +++$+++ You some kind'a pervert?
c01402 +++$+++ No ma'am.
c01402 +++$+++ Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
c01402 +++$+++ In my house, you watch that lip...
c01402 +++$+++ You sick. You got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
c00931 +++$+++ Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
c00931 +++$+++ Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
c00931 +++$+++ You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
c00931 +++$+++ You'll come up with something.
c09836 +++$+++ These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
c09836 +++$+++ Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
c09836 +++$+++ No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
c26274 +++$+++ Accident.
c26274 +++$+++ You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
c26274 +++$+++ Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
c26274 +++$+++ Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
c26274 +++$+++ Just a car.
c11152 +++$+++ Do you feel much about the things you did?
c11152 +++$+++ I didn't do anything wrong.
c11152 +++$+++ Tell that to Muskie.
c11152 +++$+++ Oh, maybe nickel and dime stuff.
c11152 +++$+++ During the Florida primary, you wrote a letter on Muskie stationery saying Scoop Jackson had a bastard child. You wrote another that said Hubert Humphrey was out with call girls.
c11152 +++$+++ Sometimes it got up to a quarter maybe--  --off the record.
c11152 +++$+++ You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
c11152 +++$+++ I didn't.
c11152 +++$+++ When you guys print it in the paper, then I'll know.  I'm a lawyer, and I'll probably go to jail, and be disbarred, and what did I do that was so awful?
c03262 +++$+++ What did you tell that girl?
c03262 +++$+++ I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
c03262 +++$+++ Jesus...
c03262 +++$+++ Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
c03262 +++$+++ We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
c03262 +++$+++ Look, I really appreciate your help, Enid, but let's face it, this is hopeless.
c03262 +++$+++ It's not hopeless...
c03262 +++$+++ Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
c03262 +++$+++ Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
c03262 +++$+++ But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
c03262 +++$+++ Hooray for me.
c12358 +++$+++ Mr. Juarez?
c12358 +++$+++ Yes?
c12358 +++$+++ Yex?
c12358 +++$+++ You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
c13009 +++$+++ -- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
c13009 +++$+++ Nykwana Wombosi.
c13009 +++$+++ What is that?
c13009 +++$+++ It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane.
c13009 +++$+++ What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
c13009 +++$+++ I don't know.
c13009 +++$+++ Go back to the hotel.
c07568 +++$+++ You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane--  --goes out and counts the silverware.
c07568 +++$+++ That's ridiculous.
c07568 +++$+++ Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
c07568 +++$+++ All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll have to be "Mrs. Stew Smith" or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's husband--He has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him.  --and here's some more news for you. You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them!  Come on, Gallagher.
c02430 +++$+++ What do you see, Erik?
c02430 +++$+++ I see the world.
c02430 +++$+++ Is it night or day, Erik?
c02430 +++$+++ Is it summer or winter, Erik?
c13005 +++$+++ Look, I don't know what's up there.
c13005 +++$+++ You got me pretty fucking curious.
c13005 +++$+++ Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
c13005 +++$+++ How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
c13176 +++$+++ Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating being a news source.
c13176 +++$+++ Nobody else had it.
c13176 +++$+++ I wish it were you giving the story.
c13176 +++$+++ That's okay.
c13176 +++$+++ What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
c13176 +++$+++ No.  Really...don't worry about it.
c13176 +++$+++ What do you mean?  You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
c10834 +++$+++ Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
c10834 +++$+++ And where do you find the models?
c10834 +++$+++ I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
c17925 +++$+++ You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
c17925 +++$+++ You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
c17925 +++$+++ Well, I donated a lot to different causes, uh... La...
c17925 +++$+++ --but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.
c00721 +++$+++ Confessed! Cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
c00721 +++$+++ I don't know. It's all been like a crazy nightmare, Mr. Dickson.
c00721 +++$+++ What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
c00721 +++$+++ Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
c00721 +++$+++ But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
c01275 +++$+++ Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
c01275 +++$+++ Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
c01275 +++$+++ Levi? Who names their kid Levi --
c01275 +++$+++ Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
c01275 +++$+++ Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
c01275 +++$+++ Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
c01275 +++$+++ He's in interrogation?
c01275 +++$+++ Yes.
c01275 +++$+++ Move him.
c01275 +++$+++ Why?
c01275 +++$+++ Because interrogation rooms look suspiciously like interrogation rooms, which doesn't exactly put people at ease. Is he cute?
c01275 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c01275 +++$+++ Is Dunbar cute?
c01275 +++$+++ Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight -- these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?
c20835 +++$+++ You're hurt...
c20835 +++$+++ It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
c20835 +++$+++ Of course...
c23394 +++$+++ How'd your baptizin' go?
c23394 +++$+++ It went real good.
c23394 +++$+++ Would y'all like that?
c04307 +++$+++ My little French.
c04307 +++$+++ Stop. Get away.
c04307 +++$+++ What is it?
c04307 +++$+++ You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
c04307 +++$+++ No! It is now that you must decide.  I love you, Doctor Nathan...  ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish.  My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
c03167 +++$+++ Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
c03167 +++$+++ Nope.
c03167 +++$+++ She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
c03167 +++$+++ So what did happen?
c03167 +++$+++ You think she's sailing without a crew?
c19467 +++$+++ So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
c19467 +++$+++ Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
c19467 +++$+++ I found you someone.
c19467 +++$+++ Found?  I'm not some charity case.
c19467 +++$+++ I know...
c19467 +++$+++ Mom tell you to do this?
c19467 +++$+++ No.
c19467 +++$+++ Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
c19467 +++$+++ This brother from my college.
c19467 +++$+++ He's in college?
c19467 +++$+++ And he's fine, girl.
c19467 +++$+++ How'd you get him to say yes?
c19467 +++$+++ I told him you looked like me.
c19467 +++$+++ Oh, great.
c19467 +++$+++ You do.
c19467 +++$+++ If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
c23058 +++$+++ Now what else? DAVID I don't know.
c23058 +++$+++ A spade, we need a spade -- I wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we're going to dig a pit.
c23058 +++$+++ So who's going to do it?
c23058 +++$+++ Dig the pit, I don't know.
c23058 +++$+++ No, not that.
c23058 +++$+++ Then what? Who's going to do what?
c23058 +++$+++ You know what I'm talking about.
c23058 +++$+++ Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
c23058 +++$+++ You know what. Who's going to do it.
c23058 +++$+++ We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
c23058 +++$+++ I can't do it.
c23058 +++$+++ I don't hear this.
c23058 +++$+++ I won't be able to.
c23058 +++$+++ I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
c11868 +++$+++ Well, well, he smirked when Marty opened the door. If it isn't the neighborhood bootlegger, Al Capone McFly?
c11868 +++$+++ What do you want, Biff?
c11868 +++$+++ Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
c11868 +++$+++ The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
c11868 +++$+++ Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
c11868 +++$+++ Where's your old man?
c04053 +++$+++ Hi.
c04053 +++$+++ Hi.  What are you doing?
c04053 +++$+++ Nothing.
c04053 +++$+++ Wanna go to dinner?
c04053 +++$+++ Where?
c04053 +++$+++ At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
c04053 +++$+++ Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
c04053 +++$+++ Ha.
c06265 +++$+++ Make it yourself, or is it real?
c06265 +++$+++ Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
c06265 +++$+++ Tax-free booze. It's about all you can say for army life.
c06265 +++$+++ Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
c06265 +++$+++ Crabapple Cove. Maine.
c06265 +++$+++ Damn! That must be about as far north as you can get.
c06265 +++$+++ Pretty near. What do you know about the outfit we're going to?
c06265 +++$+++ We got to head them off, right at the start. Push them around first.
c25768 +++$+++ Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
c25768 +++$+++ For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
c25768 +++$+++ Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
c25768 +++$+++ But--
c25768 +++$+++ --I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
c25768 +++$+++ Sally--!
c25768 +++$+++ Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
c25768 +++$+++ You mean that?
c25768 +++$+++ You said it! How about a little action?
c01096 +++$+++ Hi.
c01096 +++$+++ Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
c01096 +++$+++ If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
c01096 +++$+++ Sorry.  Are you dating anyone?
c01096 +++$+++ You think that's really any of your business?
c01096 +++$+++ Marty did.  But I wanted you to come to.
c27162 +++$+++ I had to go look for this coupon.
c27162 +++$+++ The one you bought at school.
c27162 +++$+++ Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
c27162 +++$+++ In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
c27162 +++$+++ Yes.
c27162 +++$+++ And she wanted to talk.
c27162 +++$+++ Yes.
c27162 +++$+++ But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
c27162 +++$+++ I could, but it's confidential.  Look, the point is, we didn't talk.  I told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
c27162 +++$+++ Yes.  Mainly to turn her toward the door.  I told her we would talk on Monday, in the office.
c09617 +++$+++ What... do you remember?
c09617 +++$+++ Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
c09617 +++$+++ Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
c25545 +++$+++ Pretty girl.
c25545 +++$+++ If you like 'em like that.
c25545 +++$+++ You got types?
c25545 +++$+++ Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
c25545 +++$+++ Who is she?
c25545 +++$+++ I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
c25545 +++$+++ By the way, how is your father's side?
c25545 +++$+++ Much better, thanks.
c25545 +++$+++ How many drinks have you had?
c25545 +++$+++ Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
c22144 +++$+++ He won't last one round.
c22144 +++$+++ Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
c22144 +++$+++ Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
c26061 +++$+++ How's it going with Gail?
c26061 +++$+++ No joy yet.
c26061 +++$+++ How long is it?
c26061 +++$+++ Six weeks.
c26061 +++$+++ Six weeks!
c26061 +++$+++ It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
c26061 +++$+++ Where did she come up with that?
c26061 +++$+++ She read it in Cosmopolitan.
c26061 +++$+++ I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
c10524 +++$+++ Everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  Because of you.
c10524 +++$+++ Well that's just typical isn't it?
c10524 +++$+++ Is it true Phil?
c10524 +++$+++ I gotta go.
c10524 +++$+++ I know enough.
c20141 +++$+++ I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
c20141 +++$+++ I'm...
c20141 +++$+++ Done?
c20141 +++$+++ No problem.
c13548 +++$+++ Where's the fucking recharger cord?  Must be in her car, dammit.
c13548 +++$+++ How much time do you have left on it?
c13548 +++$+++ I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
c13548 +++$+++ Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
c13548 +++$+++ I don't know.  I hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on I wished I hadn't of.
c13548 +++$+++ A woman?
c13548 +++$+++ Hey drop it, okay?
c13548 +++$+++ I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
c13548 +++$+++ It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
c13548 +++$+++ And that was the end of it?
c13548 +++$+++ I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
c13548 +++$+++ Well you did.
c26909 +++$+++ Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
c26909 +++$+++ You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
c26909 +++$+++ ...that changes all my plans, I thought you were loaded...
c26909 +++$+++ Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride.
c11211 +++$+++ Can I come in?
c11211 +++$+++ Yeah, sure.
c11211 +++$+++ Dad, come in.
c08292 +++$+++ Have you fantasized about me?
c08292 +++$+++ I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
c08292 +++$+++ I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
c08292 +++$+++ Yes.
c08292 +++$+++ If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
c08292 +++$+++ No.
c08292 +++$+++ On tape?
c08292 +++$+++ No.
c08292 +++$+++ Why not?
c08292 +++$+++ Can't or won't?
c22271 +++$+++ Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
c22271 +++$+++ Don't do it, Sam!
c22271 +++$+++ He'll kill me anway, Sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.
c21771 +++$+++ He... he just does.
c21771 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
c21771 +++$+++ Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
c21771 +++$+++ I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
c21771 +++$+++ Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
c21771 +++$+++ In Beverly Hills?
c21771 +++$+++ Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
c02333 +++$+++ Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
c02333 +++$+++ Uh, Gladys?
c02333 +++$+++ What!
c02333 +++$+++ We need more bars!
c02333 +++$+++ This is -- what?
c02333 +++$+++ I swear to God she can't do anything by herself.
c06625 +++$+++ Relatives of old man Semple.
c06625 +++$+++ They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
c06625 +++$+++ Nuisance value?
c06625 +++$+++ Nuisance value.  Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have!  Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?
c13804 +++$+++ What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
c13804 +++$+++ Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
c13804 +++$+++ Yeah.
c05076 +++$+++ He's burning up.
c05076 +++$+++ Total delirium.
c05076 +++$+++ He'll never make it.
c05076 +++$+++ That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
c05076 +++$+++ Help me!
c15036 +++$+++ You my partner?
c15036 +++$+++ Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
c15036 +++$+++ Are you a cop?
c15036 +++$+++ Well, that's good enough for me.
c03530 +++$+++ Why do you look at me like that?
c03530 +++$+++ I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
c03530 +++$+++ And then --?
c03530 +++$+++ No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
c03530 +++$+++ And -- and --
c03530 +++$+++ How tired you are!
c03530 +++$+++ Yes -- tired...
c03530 +++$+++ So alone.
c03530 +++$+++ Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
c03530 +++$+++ You mustn't talk Russian to me.
c03530 +++$+++ Strange man...
c03530 +++$+++ Am I quite strange to you?
c03530 +++$+++ Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
c03530 +++$+++ And...?
c03530 +++$+++ He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
c03530 +++$+++ I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.
c03530 +++$+++ Go away. Who are you --?
c03530 +++$+++ A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
c03530 +++$+++ You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
c03530 +++$+++ I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
c03530 +++$+++ Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
c03530 +++$+++ Yes -- I do understand.
c03530 +++$+++ I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
c03530 +++$+++ I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
c03530 +++$+++ I want to be alone.
c03530 +++$+++ That is not so -- you don't want to be alone.
c03530 +++$+++ I want to be alone --
c03530 +++$+++ Just for a minute then.
c01239 +++$+++ I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
c01239 +++$+++ I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
c01239 +++$+++ Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
c01239 +++$+++ I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
c01239 +++$+++ But you refused me, Dorothy.
c01239 +++$+++ Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
c01239 +++$+++ But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
c12592 +++$+++ Sure don't.
c12592 +++$+++ See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
c12592 +++$+++ Ever durned one.
c18760 +++$+++ Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
c18760 +++$+++ Said who?  Sugar?
c18760 +++$+++ Hey, I'm learning as I go.
c18760 +++$+++ So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
c18760 +++$+++ I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
c06801 +++$+++ Was the trip normal in every respect?
c06801 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c06801 +++$+++ No, sir, none at all.
c05278 +++$+++ What are you guys doing?
c05278 +++$+++ Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
c05278 +++$+++ Nah.
c24068 +++$+++ Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem?  And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
c24068 +++$+++ You cannot <u>believe</u> what he said, it was the worst <u>instant</u> of my total life on <u>Earth</u>!!
c24068 +++$+++ I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
c24068 +++$+++ No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.
c05388 +++$+++ If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
c05388 +++$+++ I'd wish for a puppy.
c05388 +++$+++ One puppy? Why not wish for a hundred?
c05388 +++$+++ A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
c21053 +++$+++ You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
c21053 +++$+++ I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
c21053 +++$+++ She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
c26048 +++$+++ Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
c26048 +++$+++ It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
c26048 +++$+++ I'm cooking' up. There is a silence.
c09667 +++$+++ Do you know him?
c09667 +++$+++ Yep.
c09667 +++$+++ Where does he live?
c09667 +++$+++ Right here. Bodega Bay.
c09667 +++$+++ Yes, but where?
c09667 +++$+++ Where?
c03383 +++$+++ Ray -- Something's here.
c03383 +++$+++ Where are you, Pete?
c03383 +++$+++ Third floor.  Get down here,
c03383 +++$+++ Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
c12962 +++$+++ Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
c12962 +++$+++ You have to ask?
c12962 +++$+++ No.
c12962 +++$+++ Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
c12962 +++$+++ How did you meet him?
c12962 +++$+++ They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
c12962 +++$+++ He's a launderer?
c12962 +++$+++ Basically.
c12962 +++$+++ How long have you been with him?
c12962 +++$+++ Almost five years.
c12962 +++$+++ Yes, it is.
c00337 +++$+++ Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
c00337 +++$+++ It was Freddy.
c00337 +++$+++ I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
c21590 +++$+++ Your family coat of arms, Mr. Killaine?
c21590 +++$+++ Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
c21590 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c21590 +++$+++ Would you be satisfied if I said I shot him?
c19193 +++$+++ We've got to get him to the infirmary.
c19193 +++$+++ What are you going to do to him?
c19193 +++$+++ I've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door.
c03201 +++$+++ Forget it.
c03201 +++$+++ Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
c03201 +++$+++ No.
c03201 +++$+++ You need counseling.
c04030 +++$+++ Did you say something?
c04030 +++$+++ No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
c04030 +++$+++ Rob.  Don't be childish.
c04030 +++$+++ Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
c04030 +++$+++ Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
c17796 +++$+++ You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
c17796 +++$+++ Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
c17796 +++$+++ You were given backup....
c17796 +++$+++ THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
c17796 +++$+++ I'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
c17796 +++$+++ And I'm telling you:  You wanna throw a Birthday Party:  Every kid gets a Chance to Play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
c17796 +++$+++ No, I don't get you...
c17796 +++$+++ Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
c17796 +++$+++ I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
c25386 +++$+++ What are you doing out here?
c25386 +++$+++ I might ask you the same question.
c25386 +++$+++ I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
c25386 +++$+++ And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
c25386 +++$+++ Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
c25386 +++$+++ You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
c25386 +++$+++ I... I never lied!
c25386 +++$+++ If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
c25386 +++$+++ How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here?  "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"
c04358 +++$+++ How do we stand?
c04358 +++$+++ 'Bout even.
c04358 +++$+++ When do I raise the bet?
c04358 +++$+++ I don't know.
c04358 +++$+++ Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
c04358 +++$+++ What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it.
c02873 +++$+++ You don't believe in suicide.
c02873 +++$+++ It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two...
c02873 +++$+++ Thank you, son.
c10930 +++$+++ Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
c10930 +++$+++ I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
c10930 +++$+++ Grotty?
c10930 +++$+++ Yeah, grotesque.
c10930 +++$+++ Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
c10930 +++$+++ But I won't.
c10930 +++$+++ You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
c10930 +++$+++ I don't care.
c10930 +++$+++ And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
c10930 +++$+++ And who's this Susan when she's at home?
c10930 +++$+++ Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
c10930 +++$+++ Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
c10930 +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
c10930 +++$+++ Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
c10930 +++$+++ She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
c10930 +++$+++ She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
c10930 +++$+++ Get him out of here!!
c10930 +++$+++ Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
c05239 +++$+++ I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
c05239 +++$+++ I know what you mean.
c05239 +++$+++ At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
c05239 +++$+++ She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
c05239 +++$+++ I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
c05239 +++$+++ How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
c05239 +++$+++ Bet.
c09695 +++$+++ Yes, but...
c09695 +++$+++ You are, aren't you?
c09695 +++$+++ Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
c08337 +++$+++ ...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
c08337 +++$+++ He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
c08337 +++$+++ Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
c08337 +++$+++ So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change.
c09760 +++$+++ Daisy. How did you know?
c09760 +++$+++ I told you, I knew your sister.
c09760 +++$+++ And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
c21685 +++$+++ Ever done this before?
c21685 +++$+++ Once.
c21685 +++$+++ Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
c21685 +++$+++ Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!
c22795 +++$+++ Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS? Well, Derek and I have this whole Mickey/Mallory-Woody Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing going on.
c22795 +++$+++ I really don't like that comparison, honey.
c22795 +++$+++ I find his work overwrought.
c11632 +++$+++ Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
c11632 +++$+++ Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
c11632 +++$+++ I don't know -- don't have any idea -- I'm just the night man --
c21028 +++$+++ Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
c21028 +++$+++ Y-y-y-yes...
c21028 +++$+++ I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
c16159 +++$+++ Wait a second...  Jack...Jack...
c16159 +++$+++ Yes...Jack Campbell...
c16159 +++$+++ Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  You're doing well...
c16159 +++$+++ Yes, that's it...yes, we went to high school together.
c16159 +++$+++ Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we could've been really good friends...
c20043 +++$+++ Were you born in Havana?
c20043 +++$+++ Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
c20043 +++$+++ She's dead...
c24256 +++$+++ You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
c24256 +++$+++ Really?
c24256 +++$+++ Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
c24256 +++$+++ Mm.
c24256 +++$+++ "It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
c24256 +++$+++ You cut off your little finger?
c24256 +++$+++ Let's see.
c10961 +++$+++ He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
c10961 +++$+++ You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
c10961 +++$+++ Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
c10961 +++$+++ But John hasn't got any.
c10961 +++$+++ What?
c10961 +++$+++ I know, that's the trouble.
c18843 +++$+++ What do you call a blind dinosaur?
c18843 +++$+++ I don't know.  What do you call a blind dinosaur?
c18843 +++$+++ A Do-you-think-he-saurus. What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
c18843 +++$+++ A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
c22526 +++$+++ Becky?
c22526 +++$+++ So I mailed your letter.
c22526 +++$+++ "Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
c22526 +++$+++ Made for each other.
c19602 +++$+++ Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
c19602 +++$+++ I won't.
c19602 +++$+++ I got in trouble at school.
c07516 +++$+++ Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
c07516 +++$+++ Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
c07516 +++$+++ Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
c05279 +++$+++ So, how many people live here now?
c05279 +++$+++ I don't know, eight or nine.
c05279 +++$+++ Everywhere. Fuckin' flophouse. We're still short on the rent. If you want, you and Casper can move in. You guys can share the bathtub.
c26143 +++$+++ ...and I'm troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who's getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
c26143 +++$+++ It sounds wild.  So now you're a big hero, right?  For fixing their system.
c26143 +++$+++ My husband the hero.
c05340 +++$+++ I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
c05340 +++$+++ How come you don't stay with them?
c05340 +++$+++ No.  I don't.
c10267 +++$+++ I give up.
c10267 +++$+++ You.  You're the same.  No matter where you go, there you are. Always the same old you.  Let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  I know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. We call it an "Ego Trip".
c10267 +++$+++ You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
c06147 +++$+++ You want to be the head man?
c06147 +++$+++ That's right.
c06147 +++$+++ Head nigger in charge?
c06147 +++$+++ Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
c09897 +++$+++ Alex, what is it?
c09897 +++$+++ Holding you... again.
c09897 +++$+++ Darling.
c09897 +++$+++ I need... to talk to you.
c09897 +++$+++ Not here... alone.  Please.
c19830 +++$+++ We need an exit!
c19830 +++$+++ You're not far from Cypher.
c19830 +++$+++ Cypher, I thought --
c19830 +++$+++ Got it.
c19419 +++$+++ Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
c19419 +++$+++ Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
c19419 +++$+++ Well, it's a nice surprise.  Should I hit the "stop" button?
c14221 +++$+++ As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
c14221 +++$+++ Twenty five?
c14221 +++$+++ Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
c14221 +++$+++ By the way.  Daniel said he was sorry.
c05374 +++$+++ You must move quickly. The Beast will stop at nothing now.
c05374 +++$+++ You're coming with us.
c05374 +++$+++ It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
c05374 +++$+++ No! You cannot know that!
c05374 +++$+++ I forbid you!
c18150 +++$+++ You could leave, Paul.
c18150 +++$+++ What are you saying, Tatsi?
c18150 +++$+++ Enough of this. We stay together. Let me rest, I will feel better then.
c08056 +++$+++ Ash?
c08056 +++$+++ How'd you know my name was Rudy.
c08056 +++$+++ How'd you know my name.
c27234 +++$+++ Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
c27234 +++$+++ Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
c27234 +++$+++ Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
c03319 +++$+++ So this is what you do, huh?
c03319 +++$+++ Oh, hello, Peter.
c03319 +++$+++ I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
c01493 +++$+++ Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
c01493 +++$+++ Because it's not.
c01493 +++$+++ Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
c01493 +++$+++ Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
c01493 +++$+++ No, I don't.
c25777 +++$+++ Shortie!--you know my motto?
c25777 +++$+++ Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
c25777 +++$+++ Now you're talkin'!
c24017 +++$+++ And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
c24017 +++$+++ Thank you.
c24017 +++$+++ I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
c24017 +++$+++ I, uh...  Um...
c02303 +++$+++ Wicked.
c02303 +++$+++ No more fuckin' for her.
c02303 +++$+++ Smurfette doesn't fuck.
c02303 +++$+++ Not Vanity. He's a homo.
c06389 +++$+++ What about Greg? What are you gonna tell him?
c06389 +++$+++ It's okay. We broke up.
c06389 +++$+++ Just now.
c03073 +++$+++ Listen, tonight, later on, I got one for you doesn't involve any heavy work. I want you to go have a look around Chili Palmer's hotel room.
c03073 +++$+++ I can't. I got to take Farrah to Satan's place down in Costa Mesa.
c03073 +++$+++ Who?
c03073 +++$+++ Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
c03073 +++$+++ Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
c03073 +++$+++ Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
c03073 +++$+++ That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
c11756 +++$+++ Do you ever regret things you've done?
c11756 +++$+++ Everyone regrets something.
c11756 +++$+++ But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
c11756 +++$+++ Sometimes.
c11756 +++$+++ No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
c15752 +++$+++ So how long to pop the floor?
c15752 +++$+++ Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
c15752 +++$+++ And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
c15752 +++$+++ The lipstick thermal camera?
c16322 +++$+++ ...So?
c16322 +++$+++ Three-cent stamp.
c16322 +++$+++ Your mallard?
c16322 +++$+++ Norm, that's terrific!
c24426 +++$+++ I'm wise to your tricks, lady.
c24426 +++$+++ I could force you.
c24426 +++$+++ Go on,  talk big! I'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
c23771 +++$+++ Who's there!
c23771 +++$+++ Buzz Fazeli.
c23771 +++$+++ Who's there?
c18753 +++$+++ I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
c18753 +++$+++ You don't have to explain.
c18753 +++$+++ Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
c18753 +++$+++ Yeah, what happened there.
c18753 +++$+++ We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
c18753 +++$+++ I'm relieved you said that.
c18753 +++$+++ I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
c18753 +++$+++ Oh good.
c18753 +++$+++ Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
c01269 +++$+++ What I said before --
c01269 +++$+++ Was dead right. You think Dunbar's on the level?
c01269 +++$+++ Does Osborne agree?
c25570 +++$+++ Where were you going?
c25570 +++$+++ Baghdad.
c25570 +++$+++ What's in the other direction?
c25570 +++$+++ This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
c25570 +++$+++ Turn the car around.
c25570 +++$+++ Nobody's going to hurt you.
c26651 +++$+++ You believe that I love you?
c26651 +++$+++ Yes.
c26651 +++$+++ I won't lose you.
c16014 +++$+++ Thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven.
c16014 +++$+++ What?
c16014 +++$+++ Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
c16014 +++$+++ I just don't understand.  You would think someone ... anyone ...
c22337 +++$+++ Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
c22337 +++$+++ He's not, he's...
c22337 +++$+++ Booth.  Don't.  It's nothing. It's not worth it.  Remember what happened the last time?
c11214 +++$+++ Dad.
c11214 +++$+++ Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
c11214 +++$+++ Okay, okay.  I'll let you hit those books.
c14610 +++$+++ You sorta looked like you might need my help.
c14610 +++$+++ This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
c14610 +++$+++ You're welcome.
c14610 +++$+++ The hell you say.  This isn't just about you any more.
c04409 +++$+++ I came to play pool, Fats.
c04409 +++$+++ That's good, Eddie. For how much?
c04409 +++$+++ You name it.
c04409 +++$+++ Thousand dollars a game.
c04409 +++$+++ Let's go.
c07708 +++$+++ Hi.
c07708 +++$+++ Hi.
c07708 +++$+++ Yes I do.
c25436 +++$+++ Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
c25436 +++$+++ What's the line on Visitation?
c25436 +++$+++ He'll probably fall down.
c11706 +++$+++ I brought you Chinese soup.
c11706 +++$+++ Thanks.
c11706 +++$+++ Got any easier questions?
c25013 +++$+++ You've been back to Dallas?
c25013 +++$+++ Yes.
c25013 +++$+++ Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
c25013 +++$+++ That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
c25013 +++$+++ Yes. I know.
c24752 +++$+++ And who was the enemy?
c24752 +++$+++ SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
c24752 +++$+++ Yes.
c18439 +++$+++ You said the slave had a crucifix...
c18439 +++$+++ Oh, that rumour about crosses?
c18439 +++$+++ You can't look at them...
c18439 +++$+++ Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
c18439 +++$+++ The story about stakes through the heart?
c18439 +++$+++ The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
c18439 +++$+++ Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
c08611 +++$+++ Rod... I have to get back to my job.
c08611 +++$+++ Someone actually... employs you?
c08611 +++$+++ Which street corner?
c03211 +++$+++ Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
c03211 +++$+++ God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
c03211 +++$+++ You can have that one.
c03211 +++$+++ Gross.
c05987 +++$+++ He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
c05987 +++$+++ The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
c05987 +++$+++ Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
c05987 +++$+++ The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
c05987 +++$+++ Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
c05987 +++$+++ None of your damn business.
c05987 +++$+++ He's my subordinate!
c03861 +++$+++ Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
c03861 +++$+++ And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
c03861 +++$+++ Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
c03861 +++$+++ Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
c03861 +++$+++ What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
c03861 +++$+++ Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
c20983 +++$+++ The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
c20983 +++$+++ You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
c20983 +++$+++ Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
c20983 +++$+++ You have a stunt bottom?
c20983 +++$+++ I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
c20983 +++$+++ Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
c20983 +++$+++ Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
c20983 +++$+++ It's one hell of a job.  What do you put on your passport?  Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
c20983 +++$+++ Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
c20983 +++$+++ Both.
c04704 +++$+++ Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
c04704 +++$+++ Those are gifts.
c04704 +++$+++ Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
c04704 +++$+++ You can't prove anything.
c04704 +++$+++ I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
c04704 +++$+++ You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
c04704 +++$+++ I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
c04704 +++$+++ Meaning my house.
c04704 +++$+++ I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
c04704 +++$+++ Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
c04704 +++$+++ Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
c04704 +++$+++ That's marriage.
c23740 +++$+++ What the hell are you doing?
c23740 +++$+++ We have room!  Let's go!
c23740 +++$+++ We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
c14104 +++$+++ I work, just like you. You're more of a crook than I am, dude.
c14104 +++$+++ How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
c14104 +++$+++ Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
c14104 +++$+++ It's not my store.
c14104 +++$+++ And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
c14104 +++$+++ The difference is you exploit a weakness.
c14104 +++$+++ What's that mean?
c14104 +++$+++ You sell to people that can't stay away from an addiction.
c14104 +++$+++ All right. How much is Pepsi here?
c14104 +++$+++ A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
c14104 +++$+++ At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
c14104 +++$+++ So.
c14104 +++$+++ So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
c14104 +++$+++ I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
c14104 +++$+++ Hey, man, what happened with that old guy?
c14104 +++$+++ He died in the bathroom.
c14104 +++$+++ That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
c14104 +++$+++ I don't know. I wasn't watching.
c14104 +++$+++ Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I know I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.  Come here, bitch! You like this? Is this what you want? Hunhh?
c14104 +++$+++ Knock it off. That used to be my girlfriend.
c14104 +++$+++ You used to go out with her?
c14104 +++$+++ We were going to start again, I think.
c14104 +++$+++ Don't you already have a girlfriend?
c14104 +++$+++ Veronica.
c14104 +++$+++ Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
c14104 +++$+++ Lasagne.
c14104 +++$+++ And what-you were gonna dump her to date that Caitlin chick?
c14104 +++$+++ Maybe.
c14104 +++$+++ I don't know dude. That Caitlin chick's nice. But I see that Veronica girl doing shit for you all the time. She brings you food, she rubs your back... Didn't I see her change your tire one day?
c14104 +++$+++ I jacked the car up. All she did was loosen the nuts and put the tire on.
c14104 +++$+++ Damn. She sure goes out of her way.
c14104 +++$+++ She's my girlfriend.
c14104 +++$+++ I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
c14104 +++$+++ I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.
c24739 +++$+++ I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
c24739 +++$+++ What's it to ya?
c24739 +++$+++ You must have a girlfriend.
c24739 +++$+++ Aha!  Is she young?
c15725 +++$+++ You've got a mustache.
c15725 +++$+++ A bit of one.
c15725 +++$+++ I was looking forward to this evening.
c15725 +++$+++ I had a hotel room.
c15725 +++$+++ I'm feeling old.
c09571 +++$+++ Huh?
c09571 +++$+++ I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
c09571 +++$+++ I have.
c09571 +++$+++ Nah.  I suppose not.
c16194 +++$+++ Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
c16194 +++$+++ Of course I did.
c16194 +++$+++ Last night was great...
c16194 +++$+++ Thanks.  You're not bad yourself...
c10926 +++$+++ Ever seen one of these before?
c10926 +++$+++ Ah ... a shamus, eh?
c10926 +++$+++ I see you go to the night court.
c10926 +++$+++ Well, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.
c17933 +++$+++ Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
c17933 +++$+++ My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
c17933 +++$+++ You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
c17933 +++$+++ Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
c17933 +++$+++ I can't afford no better.  My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.  You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
c21062 +++$+++ Is that so?
c21062 +++$+++ Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
c21062 +++$+++ McMurphy, Doc. R.P. McMurphy.
c03867 +++$+++ You look as if you could.
c03867 +++$+++ Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
c03867 +++$+++ You don't look eighty.
c03867 +++$+++ That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
c03867 +++$+++ Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
c11812 +++$+++ Better than you.
c11812 +++$+++ Hmm, I still owe him.
c11812 +++$+++ Alright!
c22423 +++$+++ What is your name?
c22423 +++$+++ That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
c22423 +++$+++ Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
c22423 +++$+++ Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
c22423 +++$+++ Shut up!
c22423 +++$+++ The Ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  If it is successful, there will be more. Thank you, Agent Carter.
c11174 +++$+++ Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and...  Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt?  He is?
c11174 +++$+++ Howard Hunt here.
c11174 +++$+++ Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
c11174 +++$+++ --yes, yes, what is it?
c11174 +++$+++ Good God!
c05039 +++$+++ What do you think?
c05039 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c05039 +++$+++ The room!
c05039 +++$+++ Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
c05039 +++$+++ It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
c05039 +++$+++ Roberts didn't show up. What could I say? Besides, it's double time.
c05039 +++$+++ Don't ask.
c24073 +++$+++ The timing was off -- I need this light.
c24073 +++$+++ <u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
c24073 +++$+++ Hold lunch!
c24073 +++$+++ It's only one o'clock...Why don't you get another Fudgesicle -- I'll be done soon -- really soon.
c01666 +++$+++ Paraffin came up positive. And bullet holes are usually a big clue.
c01666 +++$+++ I can't find the second one, sir.
c01666 +++$+++ Got it.
c05397 +++$+++ I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
c05397 +++$+++ How many did you lose?
c05397 +++$+++ We will have to try again. His knowledge is great. Without it, we cannot hope to win.
c20616 +++$+++ Did I kill my mother?
c20616 +++$+++ What??
c20616 +++$+++ No, no.
c23532 +++$+++ Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
c23532 +++$+++ Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
c23532 +++$+++ Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft.  He doesn't have it here any more.  Used to be like a rock.  Too bad.  I think it's time for him to retire.
c27236 +++$+++ Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
c27236 +++$+++ I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
c27236 +++$+++ Yes.
c27236 +++$+++ Yes.
c05968 +++$+++ Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?
c05968 +++$+++ I need your help.
c05968 +++$+++ Well, hey, you didn't have to come all the way down here.  For you, Chief, I make housecalls...
c05968 +++$+++ Well, hello there, honey-pie.
c00712 +++$+++ Whose death?
c00712 +++$+++ It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
c00712 +++$+++ Aw, nerts!
c02780 +++$+++ Nice joint. Can you afford it?
c02780 +++$+++ Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
c02780 +++$+++ What for?
c02780 +++$+++ Well, I would have, you know? I just didn't know how to cook it.
c23397 +++$+++ What's in your bag?
c23397 +++$+++ This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
c23397 +++$+++ What's all them books?
c23397 +++$+++ Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
c23397 +++$+++ You believe in the Bible?
c23397 +++$+++ Well, I can't understand none of it. This one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another. Just how retarded are you?
c03868 +++$+++ What happened?
c03868 +++$+++ Look.
c03868 +++$+++ What?
c03868 +++$+++ Over there by the courthouse.
c03868 +++$+++ That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
c25849 +++$+++ No, stay.  Please stay with me.
c25849 +++$+++ Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
c25849 +++$+++ Oh, all right.
c25849 +++$+++ Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
c25849 +++$+++ No, no, I don't want to keep you.
c25849 +++$+++ No really, I can stay a while.
c25849 +++$+++ All right, well, good night.
c13831 +++$+++ Okay...
c13831 +++$+++ ...here comes the...
c13831 +++$+++ Tunnel.
c25595 +++$+++ X marks the spot.
c25595 +++$+++ Something like that.
c25595 +++$+++ I hope it means something, otherwise...
c12953 +++$+++ Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
c12953 +++$+++ What?  They ain't there?
c12953 +++$+++ No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
c12953 +++$+++ Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
c12953 +++$+++ Caesar, you still got the money?
c24716 +++$+++ When I last saw you, I was unprepared. I did not know what to expect. In these past weeks, I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.  You have to understand who I am and what I am. I am a musician and I believe in music. I am an artist and I believe in art. Art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. I must confess, however, to being extremely naive.  I insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. My entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because I thought that I could, through music, do something practical.
c24716 +++$+++ And what was that?
c24716 +++$+++ Maintain liberty, humanity and justice.
c24716 +++$+++ Gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to God, a real thing of beauty. I'm going to try to remember that. Liberty, humanity and justice. Beautiful. But you used the word 'naive'. Are you now saying you think you were wrong? That art and politics can't be separated?
c24716 +++$+++ I believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate I learned to my cost.
c24716 +++$+++ And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram? Was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?
c24716 +++$+++ What telegram?
c24716 +++$+++ 'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
c24716 +++$+++ I have no idea what you're talking about.
c24716 +++$+++ The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, Adolf Hider.
c24716 +++$+++ I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.
c24716 +++$+++ I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous.
c02638 +++$+++ Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
c02638 +++$+++ They were left over from the last shift.
c02638 +++$+++ But they weren't mine.
c27094 +++$+++ Don't write that part.
c27094 +++$+++ Is this an gritty expose or a candy ass press release?
c27094 +++$+++ Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
c27094 +++$+++ Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
c27094 +++$+++ Funny you should say "peachy."
c27094 +++$+++ I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
c27094 +++$+++ Undoubtedly an aristocratic bartender of some sort.
c13739 +++$+++ One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda --  -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday --  "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elysees"  Why there?
c13739 +++$+++ I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
c13739 +++$+++ A letter? May I see it?
c11356 +++$+++ I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
c11356 +++$+++ It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
c11356 +++$+++ ...as opposed to a print...
c13499 +++$+++ You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
c13499 +++$+++ What did you think?
c13499 +++$+++ Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
c13499 +++$+++ Hey, hey, the client comes first. You think I want my future children to know their Daddy created Frank's Fun Palace?
c13499 +++$+++ You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
c23814 +++$+++ Like "Thou shall not kill"?
c23814 +++$+++ Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
c23814 +++$+++ You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
c23814 +++$+++ Everything can be killed.
c08465 +++$+++ For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
c08465 +++$+++ What's furry, furry rabbit?
c08465 +++$+++ That's a game isn't it?  Anyway...  There's been some interesting developments.
c08465 +++$+++ Eleven a.m. They're gone.
c26698 +++$+++ No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. Keith Fisher. Okay.
c26698 +++$+++ That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
c26698 +++$+++ Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
c17117 +++$+++ Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks.
c17117 +++$+++ I'm not afraid of his words.
c17117 +++$+++ He is weak.
c17117 +++$+++ He will grow strong.
c17117 +++$+++ He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
c07939 +++$+++ That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
c07939 +++$+++ What about it?
c07939 +++$+++ He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
c07939 +++$+++ I never saw him ask her for advise before.  But she volunteered plenty.
c03783 +++$+++ Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
c03783 +++$+++ Take plenty of cigars.
c03783 +++$+++ We made the date three months ago.
c03783 +++$+++ She quit this afternoon.
c22384 +++$+++ You lied to me.
c22384 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c22384 +++$+++ No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed.
c16298 +++$+++ Ya see something down there, Chief?
c16298 +++$+++ Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
c16298 +++$+++ I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
c19717 +++$+++ Reba...
c19717 +++$+++ Francis? Where are you?
c19717 +++$+++ The developing room.  I need to... see you.
c19717 +++$+++ I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
c19717 +++$+++ No. Reba...?
c19717 +++$+++ Are you okay...?
c19717 +++$+++ I'll see you later. All right?
c19717 +++$+++ Yes.
c20161 +++$+++ It WAS Windthorne. I knew it--what does that do to her love for Ian?--  --of course, if she hadn't thought Windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with Ian in the first place.  Sorry, it's just that this is so wonderful.
c20161 +++$+++ I'm glad you like it.
c20161 +++$+++ It will.
c25735 +++$+++ Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
c25735 +++$+++ Don't you mean work me?
c25735 +++$+++ Look, I'm running out of time. I need your help.
c25735 +++$+++ Lizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.  You see this? Right here?
c26036 +++$+++ Tommy, let's put the tape on.
c26036 +++$+++ Now?
c26036 +++$+++ Fuck, OK.
c18493 +++$+++ What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
c18493 +++$+++ You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
c18493 +++$+++ Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow -- you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
c18493 +++$+++ You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
c26540 +++$+++ Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
c26540 +++$+++ What did these people do when her heart stopped?
c26540 +++$+++ We went to Code Blue...
c26540 +++$+++ `Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
c26540 +++$+++ It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
c26540 +++$+++ Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
c26540 +++$+++ Well, many reasons, actually...
c26540 +++$+++ Tell me one?
c26540 +++$+++ She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
c08929 +++$+++ Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
c08929 +++$+++ Saavik... Is... David with you?
c08929 +++$+++ Yes, he is. And someone else. Vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
c08929 +++$+++ He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
c18840 +++$+++ Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
c18840 +++$+++ Tim, are you okay?
c18840 +++$+++ Tim, I'll come back for you.  I'll get Lex out first.
c10132 +++$+++ Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
c10132 +++$+++ He was.
c10132 +++$+++ Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
c10132 +++$+++ I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
c02426 +++$+++ We mustn't let him land!
c02426 +++$+++ Who?
c02426 +++$+++ But, Erik...
c26331 +++$+++ You're fucked.
c26331 +++$+++ You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
c26331 +++$+++ They're not very imaginative?
c26331 +++$+++ 'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
c26331 +++$+++ Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
c26331 +++$+++ Not before I settle with you.
c26331 +++$+++ Christ, I don't believe this.
c26331 +++$+++ Stand up.
c26331 +++$+++ Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
c11162 +++$+++ Try and understand this. I'm a decent Republican. I believe in Richard Nixon. I worked in the White House four years--so did my wife. What happened on June 17 I don't think the President knew anything about. Some of his men I'm not so sure of.
c11162 +++$+++ Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
c11162 +++$+++ That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
c11162 +++$+++ Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
c11162 +++$+++ We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
c11162 +++$+++ Well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.
c04492 +++$+++ Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
c04492 +++$+++ Hmmm... What did we talk about?
c04492 +++$+++ We didn't talk. We never talked.
c04492 +++$+++ And do I detect a rebuke?
c04492 +++$+++ A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
c04492 +++$+++ When?
c26830 +++$+++ But that group has been, in the main, subdued.  Now: How did we come by this information?  And.  Who subdued that group?
c26830 +++$+++ CAIN LOOKS DOWN AT HER SCRIPT.  SHRUGS, AND LOOKS UP.
c26830 +++$+++ It falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>.  To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. Men, yes, and <u>women</u>, trained and pledged their <u>strength</u>, their <u>skills</u>, and, if called upon, their <u>lives</u>, in the service of their fellow Americans. A group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three...
c05057 +++$+++ What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
c05057 +++$+++ I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
c05057 +++$+++ Are you out of your mind?
c05057 +++$+++ Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
c05057 +++$+++ God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
c05057 +++$+++ What's gotten into you?
c09613 +++$+++ You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
c09613 +++$+++ It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
c09613 +++$+++ Nine hundred...
c09613 +++$+++ Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
c09613 +++$+++ What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
c09613 +++$+++ A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
c09613 +++$+++ Have you got a cigarette?
c18980 +++$+++ There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
c18980 +++$+++ Some of the brown stuff is still there.
c18980 +++$+++ Then eat around it.
c18980 +++$+++ No.
c18980 +++$+++ Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table?
c18980 +++$+++ I don't care.  I hate it.  I want pizza.
c18980 +++$+++ No!
c19711 +++$+++ He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
c19711 +++$+++ 'Changes?'
c19711 +++$+++ It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
c19711 +++$+++ How do I know?!
c20147 +++$+++ See, isn't this nice?
c20147 +++$+++ Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
c20147 +++$+++ And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
c20147 +++$+++ Now don't josh. This is a very big day for you, Paul. Here. You just sit tight, and I'll set everything up.
c26203 +++$+++ Say it, goddamn it!
c26203 +++$+++ You are the dumbest person in the world.
c26203 +++$+++ Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
c26203 +++$+++ What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.
c14447 +++$+++ Not a lot of action here.
c14447 +++$+++ They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
c14447 +++$+++ I'll listen for you buzzing over.
c09225 +++$+++ Good morning.
c09225 +++$+++ Horses.
c09225 +++$+++ No.
c22960 +++$+++ If there's anything I can do, sir...
c22960 +++$+++ God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
c22960 +++$+++ But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
c22960 +++$+++ Yes, sir...
c17942 +++$+++ For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
c17942 +++$+++ Me!
c17942 +++$+++ If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
c17942 +++$+++ Here!  Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks.  How much have you got, Chucky?  Give Mister LaPlante your money.
c05762 +++$+++ Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
c05762 +++$+++ No.  Just no.
c05762 +++$+++ You prefer women?
c05762 +++$+++ No.
c05762 +++$+++ Well then...?
c05762 +++$+++ Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
c05762 +++$+++ Sad? What made you sad?
c05762 +++$+++ A friend of mine went on Carousel tonight. Now he's gone.
c05762 +++$+++ Yes... probably he was renewed?
c05762 +++$+++ He was killed.
c05762 +++$+++ Killed? Why do you use that word?
c05762 +++$+++ Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
c05762 +++$+++ I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
c05762 +++$+++ Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
c05762 +++$+++ You felt sad. What's your name?
c05762 +++$+++ Jessica.
c05762 +++$+++ You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
c05762 +++$+++ No.
c05762 +++$+++ Later.
c05762 +++$+++ No.
c05762 +++$+++ But you put yourself on the circuit!
c05762 +++$+++ I thought I had to do something.
c05762 +++$+++ And?
c05762 +++$+++ I changed my mind.
c05762 +++$+++ And now?
c05762 +++$+++ Curious.
c05762 +++$+++ How a Sandman lives.
c07248 +++$+++ ...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
c07248 +++$+++ David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
c07248 +++$+++ Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
c11562 +++$+++ Not so rough, honey.
c11562 +++$+++ Good night.
c11562 +++$+++ Good night?
c11562 +++$+++ The party's over.
c11562 +++$+++ It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
c24945 +++$+++ Who are you?  The undertaker?
c24945 +++$+++ Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
c24945 +++$+++ Not at all.  I think we may be working on the same case.  If so, I could use your help.
c15031 +++$+++ You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
c15031 +++$+++ We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
c15031 +++$+++ When you bring in Doucet.
c27127 +++$+++ You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
c27127 +++$+++ I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
c27127 +++$+++ About Suzie?
c27127 +++$+++ He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
c18013 +++$+++ Must you do that?
c18013 +++$+++ What?
c18013 +++$+++ Sing.
c18013 +++$+++ It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
c18013 +++$+++ Can't you enjoy it quietly?
c18013 +++$+++ You?
c12687 +++$+++ What can I do for you guys?
c12687 +++$+++ We want some grass.
c12687 +++$+++ I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
c12687 +++$+++ No.
c12687 +++$+++ Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
c12687 +++$+++ I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're very lucky you're friends of Barbie's. If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.
c15024 +++$+++ You're full of shit!
c15024 +++$+++ Yeah.
c15024 +++$+++ Sure.
c24423 +++$+++ You must be very popular in the neighborhood. I always see your truck parked around.
c24423 +++$+++ I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
c24423 +++$+++ I bet they do.
c24423 +++$+++ Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
c17874 +++$+++ Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
c17874 +++$+++ playfully shoves his hand away.
c17874 +++$+++ sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
c03801 +++$+++ I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
c03801 +++$+++ How many weeks?
c03801 +++$+++ The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
c19261 +++$+++ Where'd he get all this?
c19261 +++$+++ Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
c19261 +++$+++ Uncle Al--
c19261 +++$+++ Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
c19261 +++$+++ I'm a colonel.
c19261 +++$+++ Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
c19261 +++$+++ It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
c19261 +++$+++ Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit.
c19261 +++$+++ He never asked her.
c03526 +++$+++ That was lovely.
c03526 +++$+++ Will you do me a big favor?
c03526 +++$+++ I'll do anything for you.
c03526 +++$+++ Would you like to make a man happy?
c03526 +++$+++ Yes -- I'd love to.
c03526 +++$+++ Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
c03526 +++$+++ Why?
c03526 +++$+++ I feel sorry for him.
c03526 +++$+++ You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
c03526 +++$+++ I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
c03526 +++$+++ Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
c03526 +++$+++ Anything for you.
c23229 +++$+++ Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
c23229 +++$+++ Two weeks from tomorrow.
c23229 +++$+++ You're going.
c07246 +++$+++ Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
c07246 +++$+++ Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
c07246 +++$+++ The Five?
c07246 +++$+++ Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
c07246 +++$+++ Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
c20874 +++$+++ The code's some riddle of 3Jane's. Once I'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
c20874 +++$+++ ...And if I guess wrong?
c20874 +++$+++ Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
c20874 +++$+++ No we don't...
c26924 +++$+++ Hello?
c26924 +++$+++ Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
c26924 +++$+++ No Jonathan.
c26924 +++$+++ No?
c26924 +++$+++ She went to a waxwork party
c26924 +++$+++ A party at a waxwork huh?
c26924 +++$+++ You don't happen to have the address do ya?
c01276 +++$+++ Baseball?
c01276 +++$+++ I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
c01276 +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
c06580 +++$+++ Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
c06580 +++$+++ Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
c06580 +++$+++ We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
c06580 +++$+++ Don't worry about Horace--he'll take orders. Come on--
c08047 +++$+++ Be more specific.
c08047 +++$+++ A station wagon in Canada.
c08047 +++$+++ What's her greatest fear?
c08047 +++$+++ Her brother.
c08047 +++$+++ No. It's her brother.
c09268 +++$+++ Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
c09268 +++$+++ Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
c09268 +++$+++ I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
c09268 +++$+++ What else you got?
c08486 +++$+++ Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
c08486 +++$+++ Where's the pinto going?
c08486 +++$+++ I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
c08486 +++$+++ Where's Turley?
c08486 +++$+++ South of here, past Chimayo.
c08486 +++$+++ Yeah, maybe a bath.
c12949 +++$+++ I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
c12949 +++$+++ Yes, I understand.
c12949 +++$+++ Sure, Gino, sure.
c23089 +++$+++ No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
c23089 +++$+++ It's the only way.
c23089 +++$+++ I refuse.
c23089 +++$+++ No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
c09655 +++$+++ Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
c09655 +++$+++ No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
c09655 +++$+++ Would you like some brandy?
c09655 +++$+++ I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
c12219 +++$+++ Really? That's where we're from.
c12219 +++$+++ Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
c12219 +++$+++ Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
c14349 +++$+++ ... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years.  You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics.  It must have taken tremendous faith.
c14349 +++$+++ I'd say logic more than faith.  The odds were on my side.
c14349 +++$+++ And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
c14349 +++$+++ I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
c14349 +++$+++ Spoken like a true believer.
c14349 +++$+++ What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
c14349 +++$+++ How do you mean?
c14349 +++$+++ Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
c14349 +++$+++ Very smooth.  It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.  Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old.  I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
c07174 +++$+++ Will there be anything else?
c07174 +++$+++ You already asked me that.
c07174 +++$+++ Well... I need to see about closin'.
c07174 +++$+++ See about closing.
c07174 +++$+++ Yessir.
c07174 +++$+++ What time do you close?
c07174 +++$+++ Now. We close now.
c07174 +++$+++ Generally around dark. At dark.
c24806 +++$+++ Where?
c24806 +++$+++ I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
c24806 +++$+++ Where'd you pick up your checks?
c24806 +++$+++ It was a different floor then...
c24806 +++$+++ Like, this way... sort of...
c25143 +++$+++ Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil.
c25143 +++$+++ He has Israel.
c25143 +++$+++ Those aren't Jews.
c25143 +++$+++ Of course they're Jews.
c25143 +++$+++ Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
c25143 +++$+++ Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews.
c04590 +++$+++ You don't believe me.
c04590 +++$+++ Oh sure.
c04590 +++$+++ Then why are you smiling like that?
c04590 +++$+++ You think I'm like that?
c07511 +++$+++ ... plastic.
c07511 +++$+++ Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
c07511 +++$+++ You're lacking a few things too: ethics, morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.
c04259 +++$+++ Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
c04259 +++$+++ Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
c04259 +++$+++ She's pretty cute.
c04259 +++$+++ Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
c04259 +++$+++ There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
c04259 +++$+++ Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
c04259 +++$+++ If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
c04259 +++$+++ Yeah, no shit.
c04259 +++$+++ As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
c04259 +++$+++ Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
c04259 +++$+++ Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
c04259 +++$+++ I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
c04259 +++$+++ I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
c04259 +++$+++ Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
c04259 +++$+++ Hot has got nothing to do with it.
c12870 +++$+++ Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
c12870 +++$+++ Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
c12870 +++$+++ So what happened?
c12870 +++$+++ I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
c12870 +++$+++ You must get lonely at times.
c12870 +++$+++ Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
c12870 +++$+++ I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
c21970 +++$+++ Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
c21970 +++$+++ Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
c21970 +++$+++ Is that a fact?
c21970 +++$+++ No -- I'm lying to amuse myself!  Now look here, I've an idea that will get us out of all this. We haven't twopence between us, but we've got these.
c21970 +++$+++ Yes, there's our way out. A fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
c06520 +++$+++ Kid--wait--what do you think you're going to do?
c06520 +++$+++ Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
c06520 +++$+++ Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first--  Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--!
c19186 +++$+++ We're on backup air.
c19186 +++$+++ How much time does that give us?
c19186 +++$+++ Can't we fix it?
c23385 +++$+++ Did you decide, sir?
c23385 +++$+++ What you got that's good to eat?
c23385 +++$+++ Well, I guess it's all good.
c23385 +++$+++ What do you like to eat here?
c23385 +++$+++ French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
c23385 +++$+++ French-fried potaters.
c23385 +++$+++ Yeah.
c23385 +++$+++ How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
c23385 +++$+++ Give me the big'uns.
c21462 +++$+++ Good school. What year?
c21462 +++$+++ Second.
c21462 +++$+++ Great.
c21462 +++$+++ Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
c21462 +++$+++ Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
c21462 +++$+++ Aren't you?
c21462 +++$+++ What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
c21462 +++$+++ Do I look gay to you? Relax.
c21462 +++$+++ Take it as a compliment. Geesh.
c20578 +++$+++ Good morning.
c20578 +++$+++ Well maybe for you.
c20578 +++$+++ Something wrong?
c20578 +++$+++ Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
c12519 +++$+++ It's not very effective in direct sunlight, but it's a start. The goal, of course, is to be like you, "the Day-walker".
c12519 +++$+++ I don't buy it.
c12519 +++$+++ Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
c12519 +++$+++ Maybe I don't see it that way.
c12519 +++$+++ Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
c12519 +++$+++ Am I? You think the humans will ever accept a half-breed like you? They can't. They're afraid of you.  The humans fear us because we're superior. They fear us because in their hearts they know their race has become obsolete.
c01192 +++$+++ It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
c01192 +++$+++ If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
c01192 +++$+++ Mommy, please don't call me that.
c01192 +++$+++ Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
c01192 +++$+++ I know what's on my birth certificate.  You heard from Daddy?
c01192 +++$+++ I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
c01192 +++$+++ To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
c01192 +++$+++ Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
c01192 +++$+++ I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
c22915 +++$+++ Billy's right. Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.
c22915 +++$+++ You have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother's untimely death. It's no big deal. You'll thaw out.
c22915 +++$+++ Billy and his penis don't deserve you.
c25336 +++$+++ And I would like to see a priest.
c25336 +++$+++ Now?
c25336 +++$+++ Right.  Raymond... a priest.
c06078 +++$+++ See you later.
c06078 +++$+++ You really in trouble?
c06078 +++$+++ Stop.
c06078 +++$+++ Just don't ask me no more shit.
c18044 +++$+++ It isn't over, is it, Conner?
c18044 +++$+++ No.
c18044 +++$+++ I don't know.
c22457 +++$+++ At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
c22457 +++$+++ Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
c22457 +++$+++ You don't understand this guy.
c22457 +++$+++ Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
c22457 +++$+++ I'm not running.
c22457 +++$+++ I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
c20555 +++$+++ Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
c20555 +++$+++ I'd never do that.
c20555 +++$+++ Get married?
c20555 +++$+++ What, you think the guy should change his name?
c02210 +++$+++ Who's this guy?  This isn't who we're looking for...her name was Hannah.
c02210 +++$+++ He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
c02210 +++$+++ He says he got it from a woman.  Doesn't remember her name but she fits the description you gave like a glove.
c10614 +++$+++ And no AC.
c10614 +++$+++ Fan works.
c10614 +++$+++ Now what?
c10614 +++$+++ Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
c10614 +++$+++ Sailor?
c10614 +++$+++ This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life.
c09077 +++$+++ Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
c09077 +++$+++ We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
c09077 +++$+++ Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
c09077 +++$+++ Yes...
c09077 +++$+++ But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
c09077 +++$+++ Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?
c20525 +++$+++ Do what?
c20525 +++$+++ Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
c20525 +++$+++ Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
c11108 +++$+++ With tears?
c11108 +++$+++ With tears.
c11108 +++$+++ But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
c11108 +++$+++ Very classy stuff, lots of technique-
c27394 +++$+++ If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.
c27394 +++$+++ The way what is going to be?
c27394 +++$+++ What do you mean to do?
c01790 +++$+++ And what are we looking for?
c01790 +++$+++ I want to know about Treadstone.
c01790 +++$+++ He does. I've been down to the archives. I have the files, Ward.
c26939 +++$+++ Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
c26939 +++$+++ Yes, but...
c26939 +++$+++ Your friend saw them.
c26939 +++$+++ Isn't there something called group hysteria?
c26939 +++$+++ You think you influenced her?
c26939 +++$+++ Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
c26939 +++$+++ I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
c12186 +++$+++ Hi,
c12186 +++$+++ Hi.....  Roses.
c12186 +++$+++ Yes.  And	I have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
c12186 +++$+++ Great.  You said you'd ask Grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  Did you?
c12186 +++$+++ Sort of half.....
c12186 +++$+++ Meaning?
c12186 +++$+++ Honestly David, you're so spineless.
c08525 +++$+++ I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
c08525 +++$+++ You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
c08525 +++$+++ The picture's dead.
c08525 +++$+++ So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
c08525 +++$+++ They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
c08525 +++$+++ Even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, Viktor.  If they're good, they get known.  And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse.  I'm sorry, Viktor.
c05494 +++$+++ Why didn't you call me?
c05494 +++$+++ What?
c05494 +++$+++ -- uh --
c15018 +++$+++ Don't worry what it says in the book.
c15018 +++$+++ Right.
c15018 +++$+++ Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
c15018 +++$+++ I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
c15018 +++$+++ That's my plan.
c16621 +++$+++ Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
c16621 +++$+++ In her cabana, sir.
c16621 +++$+++ Oh, that's right. She told me to meet her there. That's cabana six?
c16621 +++$+++ Cabana one.
c16621 +++$+++ One.
c16621 +++$+++ Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
c16621 +++$+++ I would, actually.
c16621 +++$+++ Charged to the Underhills, sir?
c16621 +++$+++ Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
c16621 +++$+++ Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
c16621 +++$+++ I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
c16621 +++$+++ I recommend it.
c16621 +++$+++ Very good, sir.
c25412 +++$+++ And suppose they take the table away?
c25412 +++$+++ What d'you mean, take the table away?
c25412 +++$+++ Do they?
c26067 +++$+++ Sulu, what are you doing?
c26067 +++$+++ Plotting our new course.
c26067 +++$+++ Pavel.
c23454 +++$+++ It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
c23454 +++$+++ Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
c23454 +++$+++ No. The ... uh ... the Bobbsey Twins lit out when they heard the sirens. But at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull.  Assaultus interruptus.
c23454 +++$+++ For once in my life I managed to keep my mouth shut. There's something to be said for that, I suppose.
c21757 +++$+++ Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
c21757 +++$+++ Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
c21757 +++$+++ It was a business decision.
c00840 +++$+++ Because he dated her.
c00840 +++$+++ How did you guess?
c00840 +++$+++ Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
c20034 +++$+++ Yeah.
c20034 +++$+++ What's your twenty?
c20034 +++$+++ Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
c20034 +++$+++ Turn around.
c20034 +++$+++ Grieve elsewhere.
c26931 +++$+++ Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.
c26931 +++$+++ Mom.
c26931 +++$+++ One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
c26931 +++$+++ They're all human beings
c26931 +++$+++ Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
c26931 +++$+++ Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
c26931 +++$+++ Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
c26931 +++$+++ Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?
c26931 +++$+++ When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
c26931 +++$+++ I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.
c17112 +++$+++ How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas.
c17112 +++$+++ I saw him with you.
c17112 +++$+++ Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
c11815 +++$+++ Enjoying our hospitality?
c11815 +++$+++ No!
c11815 +++$+++ We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
c11815 +++$+++ Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
c11815 +++$+++ I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
c18529 +++$+++ Oh, no.
c18529 +++$+++ Come on, tell me.
c18529 +++$+++ What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
c19196 +++$+++ My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?
c19196 +++$+++ Your pocket?
c19196 +++$+++ Right.
c07967 +++$+++ Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
c07967 +++$+++ Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
c07967 +++$+++ That's right!
c23000 +++$+++ This time we take your boots off!
c23000 +++$+++ What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
c23000 +++$+++ The theatres are all closed by the plague!
c23000 +++$+++ Oh, that.
c23000 +++$+++ by order of the Master of the Revels!
c23000 +++$+++ Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
c23000 +++$+++ So what do we do?
c23000 +++$+++ Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
c23000 +++$+++ I don't know. It's a mystery.
c07226 +++$+++ I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
c07226 +++$+++ There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
c07226 +++$+++ I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
c21231 +++$+++ We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
c21231 +++$+++ Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
c21231 +++$+++ Aaarrrgggaahh.
c20802 +++$+++ I can see why.
c20802 +++$+++ Well, what d'you think?
c20802 +++$+++ It'll be fine when we get done with it.
c18655 +++$+++ I want you to give up your work....
c18655 +++$+++ Mom, please don't start that again....
c18655 +++$+++ You could teach...You could....
c18655 +++$+++ You're all I have left...I don't want you going in the water....
c16025 +++$+++ I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
c16025 +++$+++ Okay.
c16025 +++$+++ I figure that way we won't get confused.
c16025 +++$+++ Right.
c16025 +++$+++ Unless you want the right.
c16025 +++$+++ No, you take the right.
c16025 +++$+++ We might as well do the towels the same way.
c16025 +++$+++ Okay.
c16025 +++$+++ I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
c16025 +++$+++ Good idea.
c16025 +++$+++ Right.
c02058 +++$+++ And I think it's because of this redhead...
c02058 +++$+++ Know who I am, Jake?
c02058 +++$+++ No. I'm not the Anti-Christ. Or the Prince of Darkness. I'm just a guy looking for some answers.
c11319 +++$+++ Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately.  Thank you.
c11319 +++$+++ No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
c11319 +++$+++ It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
c07624 +++$+++ What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
c07624 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c07624 +++$+++ Yeah ...  That--and ...
c25337 +++$+++ I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
c25337 +++$+++ Now?
c25337 +++$+++ Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
c05463 +++$+++ I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
c05463 +++$+++ Is that really what you want to ask me?
c05463 +++$+++ Yes.
c05463 +++$+++ Very clever.
c16670 +++$+++ What about you?  Can you stand a toss?
c16670 +++$+++ I'm clean.
c16670 +++$+++ No.
c06743 +++$+++ The key!? She has the lost key!?
c06743 +++$+++ Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
c06743 +++$+++ Then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.
c06743 +++$+++ And burn the map and retrieve the key.
c06743 +++$+++ Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
c21259 +++$+++ You excited?
c21259 +++$+++ I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
c21259 +++$+++ Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
c21259 +++$+++ You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice.  But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five.  Saving yourself for the main event.  Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.
c02658 +++$+++ My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
c02658 +++$+++ Just be glad you're all right.
c02658 +++$+++ My brother is gonna shit.
c02658 +++$+++ Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
c02658 +++$+++ First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
c02658 +++$+++ You can't fix this car, Spicoli.
c11288 +++$+++ He was creepy.
c11288 +++$+++ Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
c11288 +++$+++ Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
c11288 +++$+++ La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
c11288 +++$+++ Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
c11288 +++$+++ Oh, I'd say so. You married-
c20280 +++$+++ Snap out of it!
c20280 +++$+++ I can't!
c20280 +++$+++ Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
c20280 +++$+++ I'll come to the wedding.
c20280 +++$+++ I'm telling you you can't.
c20280 +++$+++ But he wants me to come!
c20280 +++$+++ But that's cause he don't know!
c20280 +++$+++ Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
c20280 +++$+++ What?
c20280 +++$+++ That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
c20280 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c20280 +++$+++ I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
c20280 +++$+++ Alright.
c20280 +++$+++ Alright. Where's the Met?
c12974 +++$+++ Does Johnnie hit on you?
c12974 +++$+++ Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
c12974 +++$+++ Has Caesar ever seen him?
c12974 +++$+++ He does it right in front of him.
c12974 +++$+++ It's getting better and better. Keep going.
c12974 +++$+++ Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
c12974 +++$+++ Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
c19212 +++$+++ We gotta get those guns.
c19212 +++$+++ This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
c19212 +++$+++ Furry muff, let's go.
c12407 +++$+++ They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
c12407 +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
c12407 +++$+++ What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
c12407 +++$+++ You remember Halle.
c12407 +++$+++ Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
c12407 +++$+++ Those boys didn't even know him. You had six whole years of marriage to my Halle Fathered every one of your children. A blessing. I learned hard that a man's just a man, but a son like that...like Halle..now that's somebody.
c00125 +++$+++ Okay, til tonight.
c00125 +++$+++ Tonight.
c00125 +++$+++ You promise?
c00125 +++$+++ Yeah.  I promise.
c00125 +++$+++ Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
c00125 +++$+++ Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
c00125 +++$+++ Okay.
c00125 +++$+++ See you later.  Good luck.
c00125 +++$+++ Don't be late.
c20530 +++$+++ Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
c20530 +++$+++ Thanks, I needed that.
c20530 +++$+++ Have fun.
c09387 +++$+++ There are so many beautiful women here.
c09387 +++$+++ It's unbelievable.
c09387 +++$+++ I got to at least try once.
c09387 +++$+++ You're a better man than I am, Charlie Brown.
c09387 +++$+++ Go for it, man.
c25585 +++$+++ I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
c25585 +++$+++ Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
c25585 +++$+++ Christ!  Wes, tell him.  You know this stuff.
c21440 +++$+++ Are you a good lawyer?
c21440 +++$+++ I'm an excellent lawyer.
c21440 +++$+++ What makes you an excellent lawyer?
c21440 +++$+++ I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
c21440 +++$+++ Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
c20736 +++$+++ You sure do it loud.
c20736 +++$+++ Is that good?
c20736 +++$+++ It's not bad.
c20736 +++$+++ You think I should take lessons?
c20736 +++$+++ If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
c20736 +++$+++ You serious?
c20736 +++$+++ Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
c20736 +++$+++ Well, honey, I sure hope it comes your way then.
c20736 +++$+++ Sure thing.
c24714 +++$+++ So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
c24714 +++$+++ During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwangler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
c24714 +++$+++ You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
c24714 +++$+++ It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
c24714 +++$+++ If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
c09891 +++$+++ May I help you?
c09891 +++$+++ I -- what are you?!
c09891 +++$+++ What's happening to the moon?!
c01879 +++$+++ What's happened to you?
c01879 +++$+++ You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
c01879 +++$+++ I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
c01879 +++$+++ Why's that?
c01879 +++$+++ Because you're... different.
c01879 +++$+++ Different? How?
c01879 +++$+++ Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
c01879 +++$+++ Yeah?
c01879 +++$+++ Do you remember when I was a kid and I had those blackouts?
c18110 +++$+++ Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
c18110 +++$+++ No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
c18110 +++$+++ We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
c18110 +++$+++ Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
c18110 +++$+++ If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
c18110 +++$+++ Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
c18110 +++$+++ Have you requested re-enforcements?
c18110 +++$+++ Yes we have.
c18110 +++$+++ We're awaiting a decision, excuse me.
c03276 +++$+++ God, Dana's going to kill you!
c03276 +++$+++ ...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
c03276 +++$+++ What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
c03276 +++$+++ I will if you want to.
c03276 +++$+++ No... forget it...
c03276 +++$+++ I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
c03276 +++$+++ Yeah, well... me neither...
c03276 +++$+++ You must know I always... did you really mean all that about moving in with me?
c03276 +++$+++ I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
c03276 +++$+++ Shhh... I really need to get some sleep.
c07894 +++$+++ Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you.
c07894 +++$+++ C'mon, Tommy --
c07894 +++$+++ How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
c07894 +++$+++ Never felt better.
c07894 +++$+++ Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
c07894 +++$+++ This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
c05829 +++$+++ Andy would go for this, don't you think?... Firing squad, definitely.
c05829 +++$+++ Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
c05829 +++$+++ I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
c02617 +++$+++ I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
c02617 +++$+++ Anger. Rage. Frustration.
c02617 +++$+++ I'm sure I can come up with something.
c20827 +++$+++ Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
c20827 +++$+++ What d'you know about women, Pop?
c20827 +++$+++ Well, I got married to one of them.
c20827 +++$+++ Hell, I didn't know you was married.
c20827 +++$+++ Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
c00943 +++$+++ Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
c00943 +++$+++ Hey, how are you?
c00943 +++$+++ Here, have this can of Campbell's Tomato Soup.
c03711 +++$+++ It's possible, of course, that you'll die in Africa.
c03711 +++$+++ I've considered that.
c03711 +++$+++ Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
c03711 +++$+++ That can be arranged.
c05268 +++$+++ I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
c05268 +++$+++ That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
c05268 +++$+++ Because he can like climax you up to that...
c14062 +++$+++ You don't want to know.
c14062 +++$+++ You called Caitlin again?
c14062 +++$+++ She called me.
c14062 +++$+++ Did you tell Veronica?
c14062 +++$+++ One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
c14062 +++$+++ What do you two fight about?
c14062 +++$+++ I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
c14062 +++$+++ I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
c14062 +++$+++ You win.
c14062 +++$+++ I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
c14062 +++$+++ Seven months.
c14062 +++$+++ Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin?
c14062 +++$+++ Five years.
c14062 +++$+++ Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times?
c14062 +++$+++ Eight and a half.
c14062 +++$+++ Eight and a half?
c14062 +++$+++ Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
c14062 +++$+++ That's cheating?
c14062 +++$+++ In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.
c14062 +++$+++ She called you Brad?
c14062 +++$+++ She called me Brad.
c14062 +++$+++ That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
c14062 +++$+++ I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
c14062 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c14062 +++$+++ She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.
c14062 +++$+++ Oh, my God.
c14062 +++$+++ Great story, isn't it?
c14062 +++$+++ That girl was vile to you.
c14062 +++$+++ Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
c14062 +++$+++ Your mother.
c14062 +++$+++ Allan Harris.
c14062 +++$+++ Chess team Allan Harris?!
c14062 +++$+++ The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
c14062 +++$+++ That's frightening.
c14062 +++$+++ It takes different strokes to move the world.
c14062 +++$+++ In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
c14062 +++$+++ Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.
c14062 +++$+++ Oh yeah.
c14062 +++$+++ I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
c14062 +++$+++ You think things would be any different now?
c14062 +++$+++ They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
c14062 +++$+++ Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
c14062 +++$+++ I'm talking to myself here.
c14062 +++$+++ No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
c14062 +++$+++ ...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
c14062 +++$+++ What about Veronica?
c14062 +++$+++ I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
c14062 +++$+++ Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
c14062 +++$+++ I think it's safe to say yes.
c14062 +++$+++ Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over.
c14062 +++$+++ You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fiance.
c06296 +++$+++ The blonde dish.
c06296 +++$+++ If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
c06296 +++$+++ They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
c16776 +++$+++ Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
c16776 +++$+++ I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
c16776 +++$+++ Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
c08051 +++$+++ You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
c08051 +++$+++ What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
c08051 +++$+++ You do.
c08051 +++$+++ Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
c02287 +++$+++ Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
c02287 +++$+++ I know.
c02287 +++$+++ I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
c02287 +++$+++ The good stuff.
c02287 +++$+++ Have you ever made love, Donald?
c01709 +++$+++ I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.
c01709 +++$+++ Like he meant it.
c01709 +++$+++ Yeah.
c01709 +++$+++ Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
c12360 +++$+++ You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
c12360 +++$+++ Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
c12360 +++$+++ No.
c12360 +++$+++ Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
c12360 +++$+++ No. I understand perfectly.
c12360 +++$+++ Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
c12360 +++$+++ Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
c12800 +++$+++ Yes -- he mentioned it.
c12800 +++$+++ So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
c12800 +++$+++ So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
c22046 +++$+++ Tell me about that job in Alexandria, Dave, the big motel you're building.
c22046 +++$+++ Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
c22046 +++$+++ That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.
c05667 +++$+++ She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
c05667 +++$+++ Is Mae Rose okay?
c05667 +++$+++ She's doing just fine.
c05667 +++$+++ And the baby?
c05667 +++$+++ It's a boy! Well, let's get a look at him.
c05051 +++$+++ Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
c05051 +++$+++ Am I home?
c05051 +++$+++ You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil.  What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
c05051 +++$+++ You're right here, Jake. You just rest.  The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate.  Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up.
c15338 +++$+++ What happened?!
c15338 +++$+++ Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
c15338 +++$+++ Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
c03712 +++$+++ Fifty years?
c03712 +++$+++ You're making a joke.
c03712 +++$+++ I'm interested in long-term expectations.
c03712 +++$+++ Things.  Oh--you silly people and your things.  Things, things, things.
c00921 +++$+++ Lisa.
c00921 +++$+++ You know my name.
c00921 +++$+++ You know mine.
c00921 +++$+++ You're famous around here.
c00921 +++$+++ I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
c00921 +++$+++ I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
c00921 +++$+++ ...Were you?
c00921 +++$+++ We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
c00921 +++$+++ Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
c00921 +++$+++ Didn't mean to pry. I just have this theory. Some of us who got to good at this? We were -- escaping something.
c05965 +++$+++ To them.
c05965 +++$+++ Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
c05965 +++$+++ Really?  You've never been inside?
c05965 +++$+++ We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
c05965 +++$+++ So I'll be the first one to go in then?
c05965 +++$+++ Maybe you didn't hear me.
c05965 +++$+++ If it's a question of authority.
c05965 +++$+++ I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
c07873 +++$+++ I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
c07873 +++$+++ I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
c07873 +++$+++ What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
c03941 +++$+++ That your daughter?
c03941 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c03941 +++$+++ Her mother's dead.
c18417 +++$+++ But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
c18417 +++$+++ Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
c18417 +++$+++ Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
c18417 +++$+++ He jests.
c18417 +++$+++ Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
c01503 +++$+++ You're kidding!
c01503 +++$+++ No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
c01503 +++$+++ Your mom was a dancer?
c01503 +++$+++ Sure.
c08971 +++$+++ Scotty -- what's left?
c08971 +++$+++ Just the batteries, sir. I can have auxiliary power in a few minutes --
c08971 +++$+++ A few shots, sir.
c09805 +++$+++ Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
c09805 +++$+++ He has his homework to keep him occupied.
c09805 +++$+++ He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
c09805 +++$+++ Warm and friendly and intelligent--  You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.
c26865 +++$+++ What would be true, then.
c26865 +++$+++ Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...
c26865 +++$+++ Eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
c16879 +++$+++ Would you care to look--in the telescope?
c16879 +++$+++ Thank you, no.
c16879 +++$+++ One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
c16879 +++$+++ You're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
c16879 +++$+++ No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
c09879 +++$+++ It's what they want you to see.
c09879 +++$+++ This is the way in?
c09879 +++$+++ Yes.  But you've done enough. Thank you for your help... I hope someday people read your books again.
c18612 +++$+++ How is he?
c18612 +++$+++ Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
c18612 +++$+++ ... Okay.
c16116 +++$+++ Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
c16116 +++$+++ Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
c16116 +++$+++ She's only 12.  Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
c16116 +++$+++ Is that what you think?
c16116 +++$+++ Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
c16116 +++$+++ We need to talk.
c16116 +++$+++ I'm late for surgery.
c16116 +++$+++ So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
c19460 +++$+++ She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
c19460 +++$+++ She's alright.
c19460 +++$+++ Camille, she'll be fine.
c19348 +++$+++ Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
c19348 +++$+++ It was more than that, I think.
c19348 +++$+++ He was the real thing, right?
c19348 +++$+++ Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
c19348 +++$+++ Stuff?
c19348 +++$+++ He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
c19348 +++$+++ Some or it.
c10468 +++$+++ Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
c10468 +++$+++ I didn't know how to stop you...!
c10468 +++$+++ They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
c01969 +++$+++ Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
c01969 +++$+++ I like it fine here.
c01969 +++$+++ He'll double what I pay you.
c01969 +++$+++ Sorry.
c16909 +++$+++ All it takes is a long arm.
c16909 +++$+++ Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
c16909 +++$+++ This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
c17079 +++$+++ You closed 'em today?
c17079 +++$+++ Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
c17079 +++$+++ ...yes...
c17079 +++$+++ That's right, Shel.
c19512 +++$+++ I heard enough.
c19512 +++$+++ What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
c19512 +++$+++ I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
c21449 +++$+++ By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
c21449 +++$+++ Answer the question, please.
c21449 +++$+++ Thank you.
c03236 +++$+++ I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
c03236 +++$+++ I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
c03236 +++$+++ Please let me come with you. Please please please...
c03236 +++$+++ I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
c03236 +++$+++ Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
c03236 +++$+++ I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
c20095 +++$+++ Yeah.
c20095 +++$+++ History, man, history. How much?
c20095 +++$+++ Two kilos.
c20095 +++$+++ Where?
c20095 +++$+++ The airport. Trying to get on the plane for the States.
c20095 +++$+++ Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
c20095 +++$+++ Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger ten at the least.
c18901 +++$+++ Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
c18901 +++$+++ I -- I found your jailer.
c18901 +++$+++ This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
c18901 +++$+++ They're dead now.  We can get help.
c18901 +++$+++ I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
c18901 +++$+++ There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
c18901 +++$+++ I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
c18901 +++$+++ Why should I believe a man who never believed me?  They're absolutely right, you know -- guilt should never be doubted. It's easier that way.
c26035 +++$+++ Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
c26035 +++$+++ What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
c26035 +++$+++ Eh? How's that?
c02585 +++$+++ Thank you.
c02585 +++$+++ Captain, we got a problem.
c02585 +++$+++ Now what?
c02585 +++$+++ Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
c00621 +++$+++ Mozart. It was good of you to come.
c00621 +++$+++ How could I not?
c00621 +++$+++ Did my work please you?
c00621 +++$+++ How could it not, Excellency?
c00621 +++$+++ Yes?
c00621 +++$+++ I never knew that music like that was possible.
c00621 +++$+++ Oh no! One hears such sounds and what can one say, but - Salieri!
c10932 +++$+++ Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
c10932 +++$+++ We do.
c10932 +++$+++ Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
c10932 +++$+++ He hasn't.
c10932 +++$+++ The old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.
c12814 +++$+++ Why not?
c12814 +++$+++ Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
c12814 +++$+++ No -- it just doesn't look right.
c11419 +++$+++ You got your DP?
c11419 +++$+++ What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
c11419 +++$+++ And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
c11419 +++$+++ Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
c11419 +++$+++ Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
c11419 +++$+++ Thanks, Mac.  And thanks for being so supportive about all this.  I really love you, you know.
c11419 +++$+++ God, I really need to jump about a bit.  How's your film going?
c10980 +++$+++ Yes?
c10980 +++$+++ How's Broussard?
c10980 +++$+++ He's running a fever.
c10980 +++$+++ Still unconscious?
c10980 +++$+++ Yes.
c10980 +++$+++ Can you do anything for him?
c10980 +++$+++ Good.
c00081 +++$+++ In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
c00081 +++$+++ Savagery is what monkeys understand.
c00081 +++$+++ You will regret this.
c15434 +++$+++ Yeah...
c15434 +++$+++ I hear the dog really liked him.
c15434 +++$+++ Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
c02819 +++$+++ I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
c02819 +++$+++ Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
c02819 +++$+++ 'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
c11856 +++$+++ Will you do something for me?
c11856 +++$+++ Landon. I can't even do for myself.
c11856 +++$+++ Yes.
c02192 +++$+++ What makes you cry?
c02192 +++$+++ If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
c02192 +++$+++ Then I'm gonna do what you do to make me feel better when I'm sad.
c01553 +++$+++ Not on him.
c01553 +++$+++ I'm not wearing his pants.
c01553 +++$+++ Why not? He has great pants.
c01553 +++$+++ Okay.
c04694 +++$+++ Hmmm...
c04694 +++$+++ And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
c04694 +++$+++ She never particularly cared for me.
c04694 +++$+++ She didn't love you?
c04694 +++$+++ No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
c04694 +++$+++ She held that against you?
c04694 +++$+++ Boy. Boy, oh boy.
c04112 +++$+++ As they age they contribute to a sum that is the kindling from which all future life comes.  To feel it, to know it, is to be in touch with the will of every living thing.
c04112 +++$+++ I do not think I like the sound of that.
c04112 +++$+++ It does not feel nearly as frightening as it sounds.  But the consequences of such feelings can be very frightening. For it gives you great strength.  The strength of _knowledge_.  The ability to stand between the giving of what has always been to what will always be.
c04112 +++$+++ I feel hardly nothing.
c04112 +++$+++ You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
c04112 +++$+++ But why be so concerned about me?
c04112 +++$+++ This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
c04112 +++$+++ And you?
c04112 +++$+++ I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
c04112 +++$+++ I am not ready for this.
c04112 +++$+++ You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
c04112 +++$+++ Of course.
c04112 +++$+++ You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
c04112 +++$+++ With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.
c19207 +++$+++ Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me and chose your words carefully. You may speak.
c19207 +++$+++ I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am nearly there.
c19207 +++$+++ No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
c04156 +++$+++ Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
c04156 +++$+++ The money? Why?
c04156 +++$+++ Gee! Take a look, will you?
c12781 +++$+++ When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
c12781 +++$+++ It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
c12781 +++$+++ It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
c06957 +++$+++ Go even crazier?
c06957 +++$+++ I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
c06957 +++$+++ I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
c19237 +++$+++ What are you carrying, Willy?
c19237 +++$+++ Er, fertilizer.
c19237 +++$+++ You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.
c19237 +++$+++ We need fertilizer, Winston.
c19237 +++$+++ We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more subtle?
c19237 +++$+++ I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.
c08298 +++$+++ Why are you ashamed?
c08298 +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
c08298 +++$+++ You're not answering me.
c08298 +++$+++ Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
c08298 +++$+++ I want to know why you are the way you are!
c08298 +++$+++ And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
c08298 +++$+++ No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
c00691 +++$+++ Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
c00691 +++$+++ I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
c00691 +++$+++ Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
c00691 +++$+++ She's a jerk.
c00691 +++$+++ You're talking about the woman I love.
c00691 +++$+++ I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
c00691 +++$+++ Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
c00691 +++$+++ I don't know.
c00691 +++$+++ Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
c00691 +++$+++ If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
c00691 +++$+++ I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
c00691 +++$+++ It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
c00691 +++$+++ It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
c00691 +++$+++ She says she 'likes me too much'.
c09263 +++$+++ I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
c09263 +++$+++ Where's Faith?
c09263 +++$+++ What makes you think I'm gonna kill Tran?
c18565 +++$+++ What?
c18565 +++$+++ What'd I say?
c18565 +++$+++ That you were fired.
c18565 +++$+++ Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
c18565 +++$+++ Because of today?  The beach?
c18565 +++$+++ No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
c18565 +++$+++ Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
c18565 +++$+++ Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
c18565 +++$+++ Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
c18565 +++$+++ ...Everybody wants the job.  No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me.  Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
c18565 +++$+++ They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
c18565 +++$+++ Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
c18565 +++$+++ I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
c05502 +++$+++ Warner can't even do his own laundry.
c05502 +++$+++ I know. He has it sent out.
c05502 +++$+++ You're kidding!
c15319 +++$+++ Why were you buying a coffin?
c15319 +++$+++ Because I'm planning on dying soon.
c15319 +++$+++ Yes.  I'm embarking on another bus- andotruck tour of "Dracula." Twelve cities in ten days, if that's conceivable.
c06566 +++$+++ I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
c06566 +++$+++ Saunders--!
c06566 +++$+++ Are you drunk?
c23888 +++$+++ I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while.  I treat aircrash survivors.
c23888 +++$+++ Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.
c23888 +++$+++ You've heard of me?
c23888 +++$+++ Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
c23888 +++$+++ What report?
c23888 +++$+++ Huh?
c23888 +++$+++ What report?
c23888 +++$+++ Know what?
c17522 +++$+++ Started what?
c17522 +++$+++ My period.
c17522 +++$+++ I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
c13264 +++$+++ I'm going to the dance.
c13264 +++$+++ What for?
c13264 +++$+++ In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
c13264 +++$+++ I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
c13264 +++$+++ It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
c13264 +++$+++ You got that right.  I thought you wanted to kill vampires.
c13264 +++$+++ I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
c13264 +++$+++ Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
c13264 +++$+++ He did what he was supposed to.
c13264 +++$+++ But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
c13264 +++$+++ I should have known.
c17563 +++$+++ Yeah but don't forget God. System operators love to use God. It's that whole male ego thing.
c17563 +++$+++ Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.
c17563 +++$+++ Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
c20937 +++$+++ What's that?
c20937 +++$+++ We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
c20937 +++$+++ We're going to bed.
c26610 +++$+++ Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
c26610 +++$+++ Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
c26610 +++$+++ Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
c26610 +++$+++ Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
c26610 +++$+++ But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
c26610 +++$+++ Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
c26610 +++$+++ Nothing.
c26610 +++$+++ She is not my wife.
c00146 +++$+++ Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity!
c00146 +++$+++ I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
c00146 +++$+++ I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
c00146 +++$+++ You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
c00146 +++$+++ Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
c00146 +++$+++ 'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
c05824 +++$+++ What's that?
c05824 +++$+++ A videotape.
c05824 +++$+++ Who's it from?
c05824 +++$+++ I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
c05824 +++$+++ No, nothing.
c03072 +++$+++ You see the paper?
c03072 +++$+++ I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
c03072 +++$+++ Yeah, I'm really gonna miss him.
c23651 +++$+++ And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
c23651 +++$+++ We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
c23651 +++$+++ I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
c11025 +++$+++ After you change, if you're not busy elsewhere, we can have supper.
c11025 +++$+++ I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
c11025 +++$+++ Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
c11025 +++$+++ I'm not enough for a paragraph.
c11025 +++$+++ - perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it?  I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?
c11025 +++$+++ That's right.
c11025 +++$+++ San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
c11025 +++$+++ Yes. I do.
c11025 +++$+++ And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
c11025 +++$+++ Yes. The Shubert.
c11025 +++$+++ A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
c11025 +++$+++ Eddie what?
c04396 +++$+++ Eddie, what's in that case?
c04396 +++$+++ Haven't you opened it?
c04396 +++$+++ No, why should I? It's yours.
c04396 +++$+++ From a rich old man who used to be my lover.
c25724 +++$+++ Oh, no, it's the way you lead.
c25724 +++$+++ No, madame, it's the way you <u>follow</u>.
c25724 +++$+++ No, m'sieu!
c25724 +++$+++ Well, the evening is still young. Let's go down to the living room and talk it over.  It's only ten o'clock.
c13961 +++$+++ This?
c13961 +++$+++ They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
c13961 +++$+++ What about?
c13961 +++$+++ I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing - apple core.
c13961 +++$+++ Yeah.
c03425 +++$+++ What is it?
c03425 +++$+++ That woman --
c03425 +++$+++ What?
c03425 +++$+++ That woman. The older woman.
c03425 +++$+++ Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
c10630 +++$+++ ...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
c10630 +++$+++ There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
c10630 +++$+++ ...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
c22468 +++$+++ Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
c22468 +++$+++ You're coming here?
c22468 +++$+++ Yeah.
c22468 +++$+++ Then come for dinner.
c22468 +++$+++ Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
c20248 +++$+++ Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I've got more than ninety days leave coming.
c20248 +++$+++ A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is. Take it all, if you want.  <u>After</u> this one.
c20248 +++$+++ I thought I'd take some now.
c20248 +++$+++ What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
c20248 +++$+++ Oh?  What's the problem?
c20248 +++$+++ I don't know, I had to go to Chicago again.  You were in Kiev.  You tell me.
c20248 +++$+++ Tell you what?
c20248 +++$+++ When you started noticing your short term memory loss.  What <u>the problem was</u> you and Claire had in Kiev?
c20248 +++$+++ What problem?
c20248 +++$+++ Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
c20248 +++$+++ I guess.
c20248 +++$+++ Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
c20248 +++$+++ Because I can't afford it. And because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.
c10157 +++$+++ Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of your Imagination.
c10157 +++$+++ Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
c10157 +++$+++ You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
c10157 +++$+++ Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
c10157 +++$+++ Cuz I'm a skin?
c10157 +++$+++ Cuz you're a cop.
c10157 +++$+++ Not no more.
c10157 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c10157 +++$+++ And I don't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn't cut you.
c10281 +++$+++ You know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
c10281 +++$+++ What the hell do we know about seismographs?
c10281 +++$+++ Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
c10281 +++$+++ Why?
c10281 +++$+++ Goddamnit, Valentine, you won't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z...
c10281 +++$+++ ...And is dumber than my hind end. Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter...
c17876 +++$+++ is chopping firewood in the back garden. HONORA approaches him.
c17876 +++$+++ I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
c17876 +++$+++ She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
c07719 +++$+++ That was good.
c07719 +++$+++ Yeah.
c07719 +++$+++ I'll see you later.
c07719 +++$+++ Ok.
c07719 +++$+++ I don't freak out very often.
c07719 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c07719 +++$+++ I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
c07719 +++$+++ ...I don't know what you mean....
c07719 +++$+++ I don't freak out.
c07719 +++$+++ Ok.
c07719 +++$+++ Thank you.
c06742 +++$+++ Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
c06742 +++$+++ It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
c06742 +++$+++ Immune from what?
c06742 +++$+++ What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat.
c19929 +++$+++ We know so little about each other --
c19929 +++$+++ We know all that we need to know --
c19929 +++$+++ But there's so much to tell you --
c19929 +++$+++ Don't.  That will come later.
c19929 +++$+++ Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
c06922 +++$+++ Story, honey? Why, what story?
c06922 +++$+++ About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
c06922 +++$+++ Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
c06922 +++$+++ Well, shoot! Maybe there was!
c00550 +++$+++ What's this?
c00550 +++$+++ Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
c00550 +++$+++ Yeah.  I've noticed.
c00389 +++$+++ Please don't cry. Please, honey.
c00389 +++$+++ What are you sorry for?
c00389 +++$+++ I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
c00389 +++$+++ You can't.
c22913 +++$+++ Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.
c22913 +++$+++ So you think my mom was a slut too?
c22913 +++$+++ I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman.
c22913 +++$+++ If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court?
c22913 +++$+++ You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
c22913 +++$+++ Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
c22913 +++$+++ It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
c22913 +++$+++ Well... you can only hear that Richard Gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it.
c15402 +++$+++ Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --
c15402 +++$+++ I'm moving out.
c15402 +++$+++ What?!
c15402 +++$+++ I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
c15402 +++$+++ Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
c24779 +++$+++ What do you think you're doing?
c24779 +++$+++ You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
c24779 +++$+++ How deluded can you be?  There's no <u>why</u>...
c24779 +++$+++ Who's responsible?!
c24779 +++$+++ You call them...
c08811 +++$+++ Yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
c08811 +++$+++ No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
c08811 +++$+++ -- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
c25225 +++$+++ Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
c25225 +++$+++ I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
c25225 +++$+++ Hey, it's your Bar Mitzvah. I'm just readin' the Torah portion.
c01393 +++$+++ I deserve better than this.
c01393 +++$+++ Better'n me?
c01393 +++$+++ Better than what you give.
c01393 +++$+++ Rose... please...
c01393 +++$+++ Laz... You can't say nothin'...
c01393 +++$+++ I don't love ya no more.
c07659 +++$+++ I had nothing to do with that fire.
c07659 +++$+++ It's okay.
c07659 +++$+++ It's fine.
c19263 +++$+++ Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
c19263 +++$+++ They fought against the Indians?
c19263 +++$+++ Same as they done in Mexico.
c19263 +++$+++ But they were Indians themselves.
c19263 +++$+++ They were in the Army. Like your father.
c19263 +++$+++ You know who I am?
c19263 +++$+++ I got a pretty good guess.
c19263 +++$+++ That guy who got shot--
c19263 +++$+++ You didn't go telling your father you were here?
c19263 +++$+++ Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
c19263 +++$+++ He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
c19263 +++$+++ No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
c19263 +++$+++ PDA?
c19263 +++$+++ Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
c19263 +++$+++ Well--
c19263 +++$+++ I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
c19263 +++$+++ Didn't have a father?
c19263 +++$+++ When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
c12238 +++$+++ <u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
c12238 +++$+++ But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
c12238 +++$+++ Can you scare them off?
c09957 +++$+++ You were convicted of the crime.
c09957 +++$+++ That conviction doesn't convince me of anything. Until I know that I did it, I'm not going to accept that I did.
c09957 +++$+++ No. The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up. Not my mind.
c00442 +++$+++ Sir, you threw out page two.
c00442 +++$+++ Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the point in having a speech if I have to ad-lib?
c00442 +++$+++ Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
c24109 +++$+++ You're lying.
c24109 +++$+++ I lost him.  I was panicked.
c24109 +++$+++ I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
c19947 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Bill --
c19947 +++$+++ That's okay.
c19947 +++$+++ Just a manner of speaking.
c22351 +++$+++ Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
c22351 +++$+++ Hmmm...
c22351 +++$+++ I don't suppose you've seen her.
c22351 +++$+++ Have I seen her?
c22351 +++$+++ Shopping here?
c22351 +++$+++ Oh.
c18240 +++$+++ Hit me with your best shot.
c18240 +++$+++ I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
c18240 +++$+++ He came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure.  But he knew Right and Wrong.  Oh, and we kind of messed around...
c22292 +++$+++ How did you know?
c22292 +++$+++ Know what?
c22292 +++$+++ That there was a gun pointed at me.
c22292 +++$+++ I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
c22292 +++$+++ Because that's what I would have done...
c18568 +++$+++ Are you serious?
c18568 +++$+++ Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
c18568 +++$+++ No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
c18568 +++$+++ I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
c18568 +++$+++ Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
c18568 +++$+++ We have to do something.
c18568 +++$+++ We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
c18568 +++$+++ I know, I know....
c18568 +++$+++ And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
c18568 +++$+++ It's still a good idea.
c18568 +++$+++ Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
c18568 +++$+++ Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
c18568 +++$+++ A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
c18568 +++$+++ Two of them are still missing!
c18568 +++$+++ Maybe they are!
c16107 +++$+++ How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
c16107 +++$+++ Eddie.
c16107 +++$+++ He's losing his teeth.
c20270 +++$+++ Loretta. What's that smell?
c20270 +++$+++ I'm making you a steak.
c20270 +++$+++ You don't have to help me.
c20270 +++$+++ I know that. I do what I want.
c20270 +++$+++ You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
c22532 +++$+++ I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
c22532 +++$+++ Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
c22532 +++$+++ Howard.
c05515 +++$+++ I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
c05515 +++$+++ I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
c05515 +++$+++ Of course.
c05515 +++$+++ My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
c05515 +++$+++ And I fully support that.
c05515 +++$+++ But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
c05515 +++$+++ That's why I think it's time for us to --
c04270 +++$+++ Fascinating.
c04270 +++$+++ That kid is one horny retard.
c04270 +++$+++ Christ, ain't they all. All them retards wanna do is fuck and eat.
c04270 +++$+++ Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
c04270 +++$+++ Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
c04270 +++$+++ Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
c04270 +++$+++ What?
c04270 +++$+++ Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
c04270 +++$+++ I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
c04270 +++$+++ Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
c04270 +++$+++ Goddamn.
c04270 +++$+++ Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
c04270 +++$+++ I always loved that mute broad that Chuck Heston was shacking up with.
c04270 +++$+++ Nova, yeah she looked pretty sweet.
c04270 +++$+++ Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
c23265 +++$+++ Wendy...
c23265 +++$+++ Go away.
c23265 +++$+++ Give me the bat.
c23265 +++$+++ Give me the bat.
c05733 +++$+++ Makin' friends already.
c05733 +++$+++ It's freezing up here, Beefy.
c05733 +++$+++ You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
c05733 +++$+++ That pain is hunger.
c05086 +++$+++ I'm so sorry. Obviously you haven't ... Dr. Carlson died.
c05086 +++$+++ Died?
c05086 +++$+++ A car accident.
c05086 +++$+++ Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
c05086 +++$+++ Last month, before Thanksgiving.
c05086 +++$+++ How did it happen?
c05086 +++$+++ Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
c19483 +++$+++ Way to hoop.
c19483 +++$+++ I know this.  What do you want?
c19483 +++$+++ A ride home.
c19483 +++$+++ Your legs don't look broke.
c19483 +++$+++ Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
c19483 +++$+++ Please.
c25751 +++$+++ No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
c25751 +++$+++ I'm so cold.
c25751 +++$+++ You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
c25751 +++$+++ Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.
c03607 +++$+++ Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
c03607 +++$+++ Why? What's wrong?
c03607 +++$+++ You are a valued customer, as you know.
c03607 +++$+++ But what's wrong?
c03607 +++$+++ I can't understand a thing like this. It's something you almost never see.
c03607 +++$+++ What is?
c03607 +++$+++ This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
c03607 +++$+++ Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
c01016 +++$+++ What is it?
c01016 +++$+++ Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
c01016 +++$+++ When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
c01016 +++$+++ Shall we?
c25268 +++$+++ Are we understood?
c25268 +++$+++ You watched the tape?  Friedman and his people don't just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They're in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
c25268 +++$+++ The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
c20434 +++$+++ You mean we learn the rules...
c20434 +++$+++ And beat it at it's own game.
c20434 +++$+++ I was afraid you'd say that.
c19331 +++$+++ You going to tell her?
c19331 +++$+++ You going to tell him?
c19331 +++$+++ He doesn't need to know all my business.
c19331 +++$+++ So? What's he gonna do, arrest us?
c19202 +++$+++ You fucking well have to get 'em!
c19202 +++$+++ We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
c19202 +++$+++ Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
c19202 +++$+++ You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
c00335 +++$+++ You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
c00335 +++$+++ Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
c00335 +++$+++ Yeah, right.  Let's trade death by Freddy for life in a rubber room.  Adults won't see it. They can't.
c00335 +++$+++ Then what else can we do?
c00335 +++$+++ Who?
c11596 +++$+++ He killed that guy without feeling anything.
c11596 +++$+++ Not a thing.
c11596 +++$+++ Sure.  Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle.
c01376 +++$+++ What are you doing?
c01376 +++$+++ Just wanted to see.
c01376 +++$+++ You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
c01376 +++$+++ Yeah, I know.
c01376 +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
c07717 +++$+++ Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
c07717 +++$+++ ...yeah...
c07717 +++$+++ It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
c07717 +++$+++ I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
c07717 +++$+++ Yeah.
c07717 +++$+++ If you come to Hawaii --
c07717 +++$+++ Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
c07717 +++$+++ You don't think you'll go --
c07717 +++$+++ I don't know.
c07717 +++$+++ Ok. Have a good trip.
c14318 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
c14318 +++$+++ I'm willing to take that risk.
c14318 +++$+++ I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
c14318 +++$+++ Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
c14318 +++$+++ And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
c14318 +++$+++ You're --
c14318 +++$+++ Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
c14318 +++$+++ What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
c14318 +++$+++ Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
c05784 +++$+++ What belongs to the people?
c05784 +++$+++ All this. All of it.
c05784 +++$+++ I don't know... but it does.
c03444 +++$+++ How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
c03444 +++$+++ No, Benjamin.
c03444 +++$+++ Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
c03444 +++$+++ He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
c03444 +++$+++ Oh no. He said that.
c03444 +++$+++ Where did he do it?
c25030 +++$+++ Scully...
c25030 +++$+++ Scully, I found the bomb.
c25030 +++$+++ I'm in the vending room.
c01029 +++$+++ John Steed.
c01029 +++$+++ Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
c01029 +++$+++ Perish the thought.
c02057 +++$+++ Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
c02057 +++$+++ Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
c02057 +++$+++ Yeah, but come on... All I get to do is cry and get insulted.
c02057 +++$+++ I'm gonna go get eggrolls. Anyone want eggrolls?
c21712 +++$+++ No way, Dutch. I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here.
c21712 +++$+++ This isn't your style, Dillon.
c21712 +++$+++ You know you can't win this one.
c23030 +++$+++ I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
c23030 +++$+++ There is.
c23030 +++$+++ Even your play.
c23030 +++$+++ Oh
c23030 +++$+++ Well perhaps better than my first.
c11307 +++$+++ I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
c11307 +++$+++ M'hm.
c11307 +++$+++ Those are the two categories...
c11307 +++$+++ M'hm.
c11307 +++$+++ ...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
c11307 +++$+++ M'hm.
c11307 +++$+++ And blind people, crippled...
c11307 +++$+++ Yeah.
c11307 +++$+++ I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
c11307 +++$+++ M'hm.
c11307 +++$+++ U-huh.
c00009 +++$+++ Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
c00009 +++$+++ Like you care.
c00009 +++$+++ I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
c02684 +++$+++ Are you ready to order here?
c02684 +++$+++ Well... sure.  She will have the Seafood Salad Special. And I will have... the same.
c02684 +++$+++ Anything to drink?
c02684 +++$+++ Okay. Thanks.
c12758 +++$+++ I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked.  It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't.  It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
c12758 +++$+++ So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
c12758 +++$+++ It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
c12758 +++$+++ Because it hasn't all been erased.
c20407 +++$+++ John?
c20407 +++$+++ Yes, ma'am?
c20407 +++$+++ I was told you were in a fight.
c20407 +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
c20407 +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
c06466 +++$+++ What a cozy little scene.
c06466 +++$+++ Kill them! Kill them!
c06466 +++$+++ What's it worth to ya, Boss?
c06466 +++$+++ Anything!
c06466 +++$+++ Anything ain't a very hard number.
c06466 +++$+++ Now that's a hard number.
c09129 +++$+++ WE volunteered?
c09129 +++$+++ There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
c09129 +++$+++ How could you vouch for me? That's...  ... arrogant presumption -
c09129 +++$+++ I was asked by my father to open neg-
c09129 +++$+++ I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
c09129 +++$+++ Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
c09129 +++$+++ DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
c09129 +++$+++ LET THEM DIE.
c01518 +++$+++ Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
c01518 +++$+++ They like Dr. Pepper.
c01518 +++$+++ Who are these people?
c01518 +++$+++ My Mom and Dad.
c01518 +++$+++ Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
c22521 +++$+++ You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" --
c22521 +++$+++ You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
c22521 +++$+++ He lost all the weight... there.
c22521 +++$+++ That's impossible.  A guy can't --
c22521 +++$+++ Can too.
c22521 +++$+++ No.
c22521 +++$+++ Yes.
c22521 +++$+++ And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
c22521 +++$+++ Listen to this, I love this part --
c05817 +++$+++ That's not Fred Madison?
c05817 +++$+++ No, sir, it's not.
c05817 +++$+++ Who is it?
c05817 +++$+++ I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
c05817 +++$+++ Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
c05007 +++$+++ He ain't here right now.
c05007 +++$+++ He leave town?
c05007 +++$+++ He's around.
c05007 +++$+++ I'll give you his beeper.
c16592 +++$+++ We can't talk about it here.
c16592 +++$+++ Why not?
c16592 +++$+++ Because we can't.
c16592 +++$+++ Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
c16592 +++$+++ I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
c16592 +++$+++ I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
c16592 +++$+++ I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
c16592 +++$+++ Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
c16592 +++$+++ It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
c16592 +++$+++ Nugent. Ted Nugent.
c16592 +++$+++ Charmed.
c11684 +++$+++ Okay to say something now?
c11684 +++$+++ Go ahead.
c11684 +++$+++ I should've danced with you.
c11684 +++$+++ So long.
c07460 +++$+++ I don't get it.
c07460 +++$+++ Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
c07460 +++$+++ Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
c13362 +++$+++ Stop -
c13362 +++$+++ Wait, hold on a second.
c13362 +++$+++ Hold on a second.
c15057 +++$+++ You all right?
c15057 +++$+++ Yeah.
c15057 +++$+++ My mom says I'm gonna grow.
c11931 +++$+++ How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
c11931 +++$+++ Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
c11931 +++$+++ What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
c11931 +++$+++ Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
c11931 +++$+++ Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.
c19011 +++$+++ That's if we win.  If we lose, you could end up having to pay your wife's court costs as well.
c19011 +++$+++ Fine.
c19011 +++$+++ Six.
c25638 +++$+++ I've never been under the table before.
c25638 +++$+++ Look,dirt!
c25638 +++$+++ Looks like dirt.
c26785 +++$+++ You actually listen to all those tapes?
c26785 +++$+++ No, I just like the effect a tape recorder has on you.  How you feeling today?
c26785 +++$+++ A little less than yesterday.
c26785 +++$+++ In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
c26785 +++$+++ John died.
c26785 +++$+++ I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
c26785 +++$+++ You're not my therapist. You're hear to study me. Face it ---- I'm nothing more than a lab rat to you.
c26785 +++$+++ That's not true, Parker.
c26785 +++$+++ If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
c26785 +++$+++ What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
c26785 +++$+++ Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
c26785 +++$+++ You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
c26785 +++$+++ Go to hell.
c26785 +++$+++ Enough!
c25515 +++$+++ How'd you people happen to pop in?
c25515 +++$+++ We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
c25515 +++$+++ We were looking for this bird.
c25720 +++$+++ Yes, Gaston?
c25720 +++$+++ What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
c25720 +++$+++ I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
c25720 +++$+++ Call the police?
c25720 +++$+++ Instantly.
c25720 +++$+++ But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
c13446 +++$+++ Can I go in?
c13446 +++$+++ That's not a problem, that's not a p-
c13446 +++$+++ Jeff, would you go in with her?
c07855 +++$+++ You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
c07855 +++$+++ It was fun, wasn't it?
c07855 +++$+++ It was the best, kid
c07855 +++$+++ Without me. I'm afraid. I got the axe this morning.
c15184 +++$+++ Hello?
c15184 +++$+++ <i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
c15184 +++$+++ Yes.
c15184 +++$+++ Yes. <b> INT. KEG HOUSE -- CHAPTER ROOM -- NEXT </b>
c14871 +++$+++ Yes, Mr. President?
c14871 +++$+++ You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
c14871 +++$+++ And it's proving quite effective...
c14871 +++$+++ Does it make the cars any better?
c14871 +++$+++ No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
c14871 +++$+++ Perceptual?
c14871 +++$+++ Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
c14871 +++$+++ Why?
c14871 +++$+++ Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
c14871 +++$+++ So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
c14871 +++$+++ Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
c20563 +++$+++ My mother stood on this very spot.
c20563 +++$+++ I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
c20563 +++$+++ Big deal.
c22549 +++$+++ Write her.
c22549 +++$+++ You think so?
c22549 +++$+++ It's Y. O. H.
c22549 +++$+++ Your only hope.
c14140 +++$+++ Glad you could drop in.
c14140 +++$+++ Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
c14140 +++$+++ I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
c14140 +++$+++ Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
c14140 +++$+++ I love you, too.
c14140 +++$+++ Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
c24819 +++$+++ I didn't do it.
c24819 +++$+++ You could have.
c24819 +++$+++ No.
c14629 +++$+++ So what year are you going into?
c14629 +++$+++ Junior.
c14629 +++$+++ Got a boyfriend back home?
c14629 +++$+++ No.
c14629 +++$+++ Why not?
c14629 +++$+++ I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
c14629 +++$+++ No.
c24971 +++$+++ John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
c24971 +++$+++ You loved him.
c24971 +++$+++ Yes.  Once.  We met at Columbia.  John held the Cadwalader Chair in Statistical Paleontology when I was a grad student there.
c24971 +++$+++ You were going to be married.
c24971 +++$+++ How did you know that?
c24971 +++$+++ I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
c24971 +++$+++ That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
c24971 +++$+++ You were afraid of him, weren't you?
c24971 +++$+++ He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
c24971 +++$+++ Tell me about the last expedition. What was he looking for?
c24971 +++$+++ A legendary monster called Mbwun.
c24971 +++$+++ A monster?
c24971 +++$+++ Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
c24971 +++$+++ No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
c11776 +++$+++ Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
c11776 +++$+++ So?
c11776 +++$+++ You sure got a handle on that word "we".
c23461 +++$+++ Christ, Ruby, it's been so long. I figured you were dead.
c23461 +++$+++ Eighteen and a half years.
c23461 +++$+++ Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
c23461 +++$+++ You're looking good, Auggie.
c23461 +++$+++ No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
c23461 +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
c23461 +++$+++ And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
c23461 +++$+++ You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
c23461 +++$+++ At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
c23461 +++$+++ I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
c23461 +++$+++ Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
c23461 +++$+++ You heard her, pipsqueak. The lady and I have private business to discuss. Go outside and stand in front of the door. If anyone tries to come in, tell 'em we're closed. You got that?
c16245 +++$+++ Looks like the sea, at dawn.
c16245 +++$+++ We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
c16245 +++$+++ Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
c16245 +++$+++ Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
c16818 +++$+++ This could be it.
c16818 +++$+++ This could be it.
c16818 +++$+++ Let's work on it.
c15847 +++$+++ Mine, mine.
c15847 +++$+++ Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
c15847 +++$+++ No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
c15847 +++$+++ I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
c15847 +++$+++ Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
c15847 +++$+++ Of course, yes.  But now eat we must.  Good food, I have good food.  Come, come.
c10639 +++$+++ It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
c10639 +++$+++ Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
c10639 +++$+++ I don't know. I'm sort of at a critical... juncture.
c10639 +++$+++ I thought you were tinkering.
c10639 +++$+++ Forget I asked. I don't want to pressure you, Tripp. But...  ...I get pressure. Know what I mean?
c09039 +++$+++ Hi.
c09039 +++$+++ Hi. Huey 205, isn't it?
c09039 +++$+++ Right on. You fly?
c09039 +++$+++ Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
c09039 +++$+++ Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
c04881 +++$+++ Jim Garrison?
c04881 +++$+++ Yes.
c04881 +++$+++ Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
c17161 +++$+++ Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
c17161 +++$+++ We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
c17161 +++$+++ Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
c17161 +++$+++ You were unfair with them.
c17161 +++$+++ Says who?
c17161 +++$+++ Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
c17161 +++$+++ Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
c17161 +++$+++ They feel cheated.
c17161 +++$+++ Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
c17161 +++$+++ Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone!
c17161 +++$+++ And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami.
c17161 +++$+++ Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean.
c17161 +++$+++ The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami.
c17161 +++$+++ I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
c17161 +++$+++ How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
c17161 +++$+++ No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
c17161 +++$+++ You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
c17161 +++$+++ He did business...but he never trusted him.
c14042 +++$+++ Hey, now wait a sec...
c14042 +++$+++ Now he's going to launch into his rap about how he's just doing his job; following orders.  Friends, let me tell you about another bunch of hate mongers that were just following orders: they were called Nazis, and they practically wiped a nation of people from the Earth... just like cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette smoking is the new Holocaust, and those that partake in the practice of smoking or sell the wares that promote it are the Nazis of the nineties! He doesn't care how many people die from it! He smiles as you pay for your cancer sticks and says, "Have a nice day."
c14042 +++$+++ I think you'd better leave now.
c14042 +++$+++ You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
c14042 +++$+++ You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
c24837 +++$+++ What's the matter?
c24837 +++$+++ Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
c24837 +++$+++ The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
c24837 +++$+++ I sure hope so.
c04908 +++$+++ What have they told you?
c04908 +++$+++ So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
c04908 +++$+++ I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
c04908 +++$+++ Shit.
c04908 +++$+++ Sure.
c19621 +++$+++ Cmon,cmon,cmon, that one to?
c19621 +++$+++ I need this one.
c19621 +++$+++ I can't carry all of them. I need them. I need my books. I need them to go to school.
c09724 +++$+++ You asked to see me, ma'am?
c09724 +++$+++ I want you to help my little girl.
c09724 +++$+++ I'm only a student.
c09724 +++$+++ Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
c09724 +++$+++ Did he tell you about Georgina?
c25755 +++$+++ Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
c25755 +++$+++ Do you want the truth, Anya?
c25755 +++$+++ It would be a nice change from you.
c25755 +++$+++ I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
c25755 +++$+++ You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
c25755 +++$+++ How'd you ever get away with it?
c25755 +++$+++ When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
c25755 +++$+++ I never want to go back....
c06444 +++$+++ We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
c06444 +++$+++ I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
c06444 +++$+++ I been thinkin'...
c06444 +++$+++ Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
c06444 +++$+++ We need to put together a meet for the whole country. We all got the same problems. We could talk. Meet the guys we don't know. Lift a few with the guys we do.
c06444 +++$+++ Italians, Jews, Irish. One big party. Course, some guys don't get along.
c25592 +++$+++ Where you going?
c25592 +++$+++ Me and Wes are just going to talk.
c25592 +++$+++ Why you got to move away to talk!?
c25592 +++$+++ We're going to be right over here.
c25592 +++$+++ I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
c13220 +++$+++ I'm sorry about what I said before.
c13220 +++$+++ Forget it.
c13220 +++$+++ I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
c13220 +++$+++ Would you let me make...a statue of you?
c16987 +++$+++ I won't be using the room tonight.
c16987 +++$+++ I see.
c16987 +++$+++ I'm staying with a friend.
c16987 +++$+++ Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
c16987 +++$+++ It never is.
c22890 +++$+++ Have they found my father?
c22890 +++$+++ Afraid not.
c22890 +++$+++ Not yet.
c01237 +++$+++ Will we always leave it at this?
c01237 +++$+++ Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
c01237 +++$+++ I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
c01237 +++$+++ Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
c01237 +++$+++ Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
c01237 +++$+++ Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
c13748 +++$+++ What's going on?
c13748 +++$+++ Don't you understand French?
c13748 +++$+++ The man and the woman are married --
c23024 +++$+++ Master Shakespeare
c23024 +++$+++ Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam...?
c23024 +++$+++ It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
c23024 +++$+++ "Parting is such sweet sorrow..."
c27167 +++$+++ Sandy... What's up?
c27167 +++$+++ Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
c27167 +++$+++ No.
c27167 +++$+++ Shit. Here we go again.
c27167 +++$+++ To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.
c12722 +++$+++ You're like your mother.  You love money.
c12722 +++$+++ Dad.
c12722 +++$+++ Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
c18335 +++$+++ This just isn't the best moment for this.
c18335 +++$+++ I know, I know. I had no idea --
c18335 +++$+++ That this was going to be a key party?
c18335 +++$+++ Yeah, well, if we'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse. A key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already?
c18335 +++$+++ Well?
c18335 +++$+++ I think we're here and we don't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home.
c18335 +++$+++ Damn it, Ben --
c18335 +++$+++ I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
c18335 +++$+++ You're not going to --
c18335 +++$+++ I'm not.
c18335 +++$+++ Elena.
c02112 +++$+++ That girl, she works at the casino --
c02112 +++$+++ -- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
c02112 +++$+++ It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
c10978 +++$+++ We can't expect to understand a life form like this.  We're out of our back yard.  Things are different here.
c10978 +++$+++ Well, can't we kill it?  I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
c10978 +++$+++ How about cutting it off?  We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
c23774 +++$+++ Come on, Junior. Everyone's waiting for you, son. The beam of light catches Junior's face. He is crouched inside the machine at lane six. Jr. His face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy.
c23774 +++$+++ Needs lubrication. Lubrication.
c23774 +++$+++ You made me hurt him!
c05325 +++$+++ That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
c05325 +++$+++ Anything else?
c05325 +++$+++ Yes.  Why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
c05325 +++$+++ I would think it's some type of clue as to where he's going to kill next?
c17289 +++$+++ What did you hear about that thing?
c17289 +++$+++ What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
c17289 +++$+++ No. No. The guy from downtown.
c17289 +++$+++ The guy from near where Christie used to live?
c17289 +++$+++ Oh I Him.
c19635 +++$+++ What is it, mother?
c19635 +++$+++ I wish to discuss your brother.
c19635 +++$+++ He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
c19635 +++$+++ First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
c19635 +++$+++ I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
c19635 +++$+++ He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
c19635 +++$+++ Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
c19635 +++$+++ You have prayed too much.  Your mind is weak.
c09150 +++$+++ At present he serves no useful function. Dr. Soong created us to become active and useful members of society. I do not believe he would have wanted the B-9 to live out his life in his present state.
c09150 +++$+++ I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
c09150 +++$+++ Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
c09150 +++$+++ He'd have all your memories too. You feel comfortable with that?
c09150 +++$+++ I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
c09150 +++$+++ An individual more like you, you mean.
c09150 +++$+++ Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
c04591 +++$+++ What's Gruner like?
c04591 +++$+++ They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
c04591 +++$+++ Who was?
c04591 +++$+++ Ryuji and Gruner.
c04591 +++$+++ And Dieter.
c04591 +++$+++ Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
c04591 +++$+++ It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
c22449 +++$+++ This is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  Make him think you don't trust him.
c22449 +++$+++ I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
c22449 +++$+++ I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
c22449 +++$+++ Shit, I ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  That does nothin' for me.  No. I don't need to be pattin' no ass. All I'm sayin' is, how do I know you're not a cop?
c10395 +++$+++ Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
c10395 +++$+++ And no one will know the truth.
c10395 +++$+++ That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
c16021 +++$+++ Hey, Frank.
c16021 +++$+++ You recognized me.
c16021 +++$+++ Just a lucky guess.
c16021 +++$+++ So what do you think?
c16021 +++$+++ Yeah, well, what can I say?  Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?
c26336 +++$+++ Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.
c26336 +++$+++ No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
c26336 +++$+++ Just curious.  That's a nasty cut you've got.
c26336 +++$+++ Not as bad as it looks.
c26336 +++$+++ There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
c26336 +++$+++ Wouldn't know anything about it.
c26336 +++$+++ That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
c26336 +++$+++ Wish I could help, Sheriff.  But if you'll excuse me I'm going over to Harlin's to pick up my car.  Then I'm getting the hell out of this place.
c26336 +++$+++ Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
c07797 +++$+++ So you ever gonna do a picture?
c07797 +++$+++ Not you too
c07797 +++$+++ It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
c07797 +++$+++ I wonder sometimes.
c07797 +++$+++ Am I?
c24378 +++$+++ You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
c24378 +++$+++ I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
c24378 +++$+++ Cute.  Let's have some drinks.
c17889 +++$+++ I think I'm going crazy.
c17889 +++$+++ No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
c17889 +++$+++ You mean travel by ourselves?
c19805 +++$+++ What the fuck do they want with me?!
c19805 +++$+++ I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
c19805 +++$+++ I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
c04104 +++$+++ Hmm, que rico.  What is it you call this?
c04104 +++$+++ Pheasant.
c04104 +++$+++ You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
c04104 +++$+++ Why are you here?
c04104 +++$+++ I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
c04104 +++$+++ You're a long way from Inverness.
c04104 +++$+++ In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
c04104 +++$+++ It was time for our paths to cross.
c19823 +++$+++ No, you... have to be.
c19823 +++$+++ I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
c19823 +++$+++ No, Neo.  That's not true.  It can't be true.
c19823 +++$+++ Because...
c10250 +++$+++ Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
c10250 +++$+++ Any news of Quaid?
c10250 +++$+++ Watch your mouth, Captain.
c11345 +++$+++ If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
c11345 +++$+++ The what?
c11345 +++$+++ The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
c11345 +++$+++ You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
c11345 +++$+++ I thought just earplugs.
c22770 +++$+++ The place produces nothing.  I shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the Army.  That's not all right.
c22770 +++$+++ So I'll talk to him about it.
c22770 +++$+++ He's got no style, we all know that. So, we should hang him for it?
c08008 +++$+++ Is he your friend?
c08008 +++$+++ Yes.  My best friend.
c08008 +++$+++ What's he like?
c08008 +++$+++ Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
c08008 +++$+++ Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
c08008 +++$+++ Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
c08008 +++$+++ Okay.
c12279 +++$+++ I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey...  ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you...
c12279 +++$+++ Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
c12279 +++$+++ Thank you.
c26741 +++$+++ ...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
c26741 +++$+++ ...embarrassing, shameful...
c26741 +++$+++ ...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
c26741 +++$+++ The stone age.
c26741 +++$+++ The post-Vegas Man.
c26741 +++$+++ Okay boys, smile!
c00633 +++$+++ Do you want to rest a bit?
c00633 +++$+++ Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
c00633 +++$+++ We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
c00633 +++$+++ I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
c00633 +++$+++ Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
c00633 +++$+++ I'm not leaving you.
c00633 +++$+++ I am so ashamed.
c00633 +++$+++ I was foolish. I thought you did not care for my work - or me. Forgive me. Forgive me!
c14271 +++$+++ I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
c14271 +++$+++ For what?
c14271 +++$+++ <u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
c16311 +++$+++ ...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
c16311 +++$+++ It's okay...
c16311 +++$+++ It's okay, Mike...
c24015 +++$+++ Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
c24015 +++$+++ I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
c24015 +++$+++ You have to what?
c14654 +++$+++ That's so romantic. Have you responded?
c14654 +++$+++ No.
c14654 +++$+++ Well do you like him?
c14654 +++$+++ I don't know.
c14654 +++$+++ I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
c13807 +++$+++ Hi mom.
c13807 +++$+++ Hi princess.
c13807 +++$+++ Mom?
c13807 +++$+++ Yes?
c13807 +++$+++ I need to ask you something.
c13807 +++$+++ Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
c09623 +++$+++ Yes.
c09623 +++$+++ You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge?
c09623 +++$+++ No.  But...
c09623 +++$+++ But what?
c09623 +++$+++ Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
c09623 +++$+++ What's that?
c09623 +++$+++ "It's a Wonderful Life."
c09623 +++$+++ The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh?
c09623 +++$+++ "It's a Wonderful Life?"
c09623 +++$+++ I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
c03832 +++$+++ You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
c03832 +++$+++ It's just a name.
c03832 +++$+++ Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
c03832 +++$+++ Who? The whore? No. She's just a victim. A dime a dozen.
c02907 +++$+++ This ain't the time, Richard.
c02907 +++$+++ Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
c02907 +++$+++ Or what?
c10308 +++$+++ Goddam it... the little punk bests me again, I get thrown down and lectured at and where the hell were you?
c10308 +++$+++ 1530 Rivington Street.
c10308 +++$+++ -- What?
c10308 +++$+++ You sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.  Nice.
c20790 +++$+++ Oh yeah?
c20790 +++$+++ You work around town?
c20790 +++$+++ I'm a teacher.
c20790 +++$+++ Went to college, huh?
c20790 +++$+++ In Birmingham.
c20790 +++$+++ Oh yeah? That's my home town.
c20790 +++$+++ Your folks live there?
c20790 +++$+++ No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
c20790 +++$+++ Yes, aren't you?
c20790 +++$+++ No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
c20790 +++$+++ My father's the preacher.
c20790 +++$+++ Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
c20790 +++$+++ That's right.
c20790 +++$+++ Maybe.
c14959 +++$+++ Who gives a shit about aft?
c14959 +++$+++ That's where my boat's moored.
c14959 +++$+++ Just trying to get to my boat...
c13760 +++$+++ It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
c13760 +++$+++ Didn't Charles have any friends?
c13760 +++$+++ At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
c09418 +++$+++ It's on.
c09418 +++$+++ You think?
c09418 +++$+++ Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
c09418 +++$+++ ...double diamond...
c09418 +++$+++ True.
c21750 +++$+++ Edward, I can't.
c21750 +++$+++ Shush.  Of course you can.
c21750 +++$+++ What if I lose it?
c21750 +++$+++ You won't.
c21750 +++$+++ I'll guard them and you with my life.
c15359 +++$+++ That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
c15359 +++$+++ Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
c15359 +++$+++ None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
c15359 +++$+++ Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.
c02511 +++$+++ I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
c02511 +++$+++ Well... I did.
c02511 +++$+++ It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
c06681 +++$+++ It's all right, it won't bite you. Under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. This is the notice.
c06681 +++$+++ Do you want to come in?
c06681 +++$+++ Mr. Gilroy --
c06205 +++$+++ He's not a cop killer.
c06205 +++$+++ I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing.
c06205 +++$+++ So am I.
c25684 +++$+++ Nice day, Major.
c25684 +++$+++ Umm.
c25684 +++$+++ Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
c16847 +++$+++ You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
c16847 +++$+++ "It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
c16847 +++$+++ You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
c16847 +++$+++ If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.
c26952 +++$+++ He looked like one of the Monkees.
c26952 +++$+++ Anyway, Claire slept with him...
c26952 +++$+++ I didn't sleep with him.
c26952 +++$+++ ...just so she could cut them off.
c26952 +++$+++ He was so pissed.
c26952 +++$+++ I came in from my room...
c26952 +++$+++ We were suite mates.
c26952 +++$+++ Oh God...
c15093 +++$+++ But I'm glad to be home again --
c15093 +++$+++ Tired?
c15093 +++$+++ Worried!
c15093 +++$+++ There is nothing to worry about now.
c15093 +++$+++ Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
c09929 +++$+++ How did you get hurt?
c09929 +++$+++ Kalen...
c09929 +++$+++ That's quite enough, Kalen.
c17432 +++$+++ We gonna live here?
c17432 +++$+++ Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
c17432 +++$+++ This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
c24980 +++$+++ Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
c24980 +++$+++ --a dead one at that.
c24980 +++$+++ --and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
c24980 +++$+++ Since Kirk started this whole crisis in Truman's life, I came to the conclusion that he was the only one who could end it.
c24980 +++$+++ I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
c24980 +++$+++ That and a fat, new contract.
c24980 +++$+++ How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
c24980 +++$+++ Of course.
c00324 +++$+++ Mrs. Mathews, your daughter is dead. She's dead.
c00324 +++$+++ Who is this... ?
c00324 +++$+++ Someone... some men, they took your daughter and they drugged her, and they took her to a motel room... they did terrible things to her...
c00324 +++$+++ Who are you?
c00324 +++$+++ They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
c00324 +++$+++ No...
c00324 +++$+++ He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
c00324 +++$+++ No... no... no...
c00324 +++$+++ They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
c00324 +++$+++ They murdered her, Mrs. Mathews, I'm sorry.  It happened a month after she ran away.  She's been dead all this time...
c17923 +++$+++ You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
c17923 +++$+++ What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
c17923 +++$+++ Right.
c09977 +++$+++ Hey.
c09977 +++$+++ How are things goin' out there?
c09977 +++$+++ Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
c09977 +++$+++ Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
c12728 +++$+++ George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
c12728 +++$+++ Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
c12728 +++$+++ Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
c20591 +++$+++ You are perfectly healthy.
c20591 +++$+++ That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
c20591 +++$+++ Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
c20591 +++$+++ Vada you've gotta stop this, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you!
c10409 +++$+++ I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
c10409 +++$+++ That's what I'd planned to...
c10409 +++$+++ I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
c10409 +++$+++ From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
c10409 +++$+++ Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
c10409 +++$+++ ...I made a reservation at...
c10409 +++$+++ ...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
c10409 +++$+++ ...What difference would...
c10409 +++$+++ There's nothing they can do to me.
c01617 +++$+++ It used to make me laugh, but.
c01617 +++$+++ I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
c01617 +++$+++ Yes. Frank--
c01617 +++$+++ Frank is coming?
c01617 +++$+++ No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
c01617 +++$+++ I sure don't hate you.
c01617 +++$+++ That's good.
c22157 +++$+++ Seven minutes!
c22157 +++$+++ It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
c22157 +++$+++ Six!
c22157 +++$+++ How 'bout some Cokes?
c22157 +++$+++ This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
c26251 +++$+++ I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.
c26251 +++$+++ I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
c26251 +++$+++ Plan?  What are you talking about?
c26251 +++$+++ Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
c26251 +++$+++ Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
c26251 +++$+++ Listen, you dumb fuck!  The thing mutates We live underground!  The world belongs to the fucking dogs and cats.  We're like moles or worms.  All we want to do is study the original...
c12645 +++$+++ Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
c12645 +++$+++ I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
c12645 +++$+++ Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
c12645 +++$+++ My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
c12645 +++$+++ You really do hear a lot, don't you?
c12645 +++$+++ Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
c12645 +++$+++ I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
c12645 +++$+++ It's not bad. but it's bad enough. it's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
c11389 +++$+++ Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
c11389 +++$+++ He's not going tonight.
c11389 +++$+++ I told his father he'd be on that flight.
c11389 +++$+++ Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
c11389 +++$+++ Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
c11389 +++$+++ And you're not the wife.
c11389 +++$+++ Damn straight.
c24749 +++$+++ He'll find us, won't he?
c24749 +++$+++ Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
c24749 +++$+++ Don't say that.
c24749 +++$+++ If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
c24749 +++$+++ No.  I'm not.
c09148 +++$+++ We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
c09148 +++$+++ It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
c09148 +++$+++ Commander Riker, evasive maneuvers!
c27432 +++$+++ It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?
c27432 +++$+++ What?
c27432 +++$+++ More, do you hear me?
c27432 +++$+++ What?
c27432 +++$+++ Wait till he sees the bill.
c21770 +++$+++ 'Lo.
c21770 +++$+++ Kit!  Where've you been?
c21770 +++$+++ I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
c21770 +++$+++ Why'd he want you?
c14130 +++$+++ And... he told you all of this?
c14130 +++$+++ Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
c14130 +++$+++ I... I don't know what to say.
c14130 +++$+++ Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
c14130 +++$+++ I'm not sad.
c14130 +++$+++ You're not?
c14130 +++$+++ No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
c14130 +++$+++ He didn't ask me to...
c14130 +++$+++ After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
c14130 +++$+++ I'm going to have a word with that asshole.
c13398 +++$+++ I'm going to go powder my nose.
c13398 +++$+++ Ginger's mission in life was money.
c13398 +++$+++ See you, Ginger.
c06567 +++$+++ It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
c06567 +++$+++ Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
c06567 +++$+++ Well, I guess it's a chance.
c06567 +++$+++ Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
c06567 +++$+++ I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*!
c06567 +++$+++ Wait--
c06567 +++$+++ What you *have* to do is fight!
c06567 +++$+++ But--I've done everything I--
c06567 +++$+++ I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
c06567 +++$+++ Oh--Saunders--
c06567 +++$+++ Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
c06567 +++$+++ We'll *find* one! Only throw compromise out of the window--stick to Jeff Smith, the man who first came to this town--get up and *fight*-- and we'll find *some* way. I don't know where we'll wind up--but the flag'll be flying--!
c02039 +++$+++ There was no visible wound?
c02039 +++$+++ No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
c02039 +++$+++ Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
c26182 +++$+++ Was it him or you?
c26182 +++$+++ Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
c26182 +++$+++ No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
c00504 +++$+++ Good-bye, darling.
c00504 +++$+++ Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
c00504 +++$+++ So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
c00504 +++$+++ Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
c00504 +++$+++ Good-bye, darling.
c00504 +++$+++ Good-bye, darling.
c27433 +++$+++ Oh, do you like it?  I'm not partial to desserts, but this is excellent.
c27433 +++$+++ Who are you talking to?
c27433 +++$+++ To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
c27433 +++$+++ I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
c27433 +++$+++ It wasn't me.
c19276 +++$+++ --warning. Not 'cause he had it in for the colored
c19276 +++$+++ --but just as a kind of safety tip.
c19276 +++$+++ Old Sam stood for somethin', you know? The day that man died they broke the goddamn mold.
c26500 +++$+++ How are they going to do it?
c26500 +++$+++ McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
c26500 +++$+++ Fenster and Hockney?
c26500 +++$+++ They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
c26500 +++$+++ Three million?
c26500 +++$+++ Maybe more.
c26500 +++$+++ Not if we do it my way.
c16307 +++$+++ Yah, yah, course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it?
c16307 +++$+++ Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
c16307 +++$+++ No, that's okay.
c16307 +++$+++ Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
c16307 +++$+++ Yah.
c16307 +++$+++ I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
c16307 +++$+++ Yah, that's me.
c16307 +++$+++ Well, how the heck are ya?
c16307 +++$+++ Okay, ya know. Okay.
c16307 +++$+++ Yah?
c16307 +++$+++ Yah - how are you doon?
c16307 +++$+++ Oh, pretty good.
c16307 +++$+++ Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
c19438 +++$+++ Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
c19438 +++$+++ I had to.
c19438 +++$+++ And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
c19438 +++$+++ Well, why should I?  Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
c13964 +++$+++ Tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
c13964 +++$+++ We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
c13964 +++$+++ No, you have a press agent do it.
c15504 +++$+++ She's doing this to get back at me
c15504 +++$+++ For what?
c15504 +++$+++ I mean at you.
c15504 +++$+++ I don't know.  You're her brother you should know.
c05294 +++$+++ Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
c05294 +++$+++ Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
c05294 +++$+++ Jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. You've lost your perspective.  You can't possibly be unbiased.
c01399 +++$+++ Let me say somethin' first...
c01399 +++$+++ Why you got me chained?
c01399 +++$+++ Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
c01399 +++$+++ The fuck you been doin' to me?
c01399 +++$+++ Get this Goddamn thing off me!
c24547 +++$+++ Where's mine?! Where's my parachute?
c24547 +++$+++ Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
c24547 +++$+++ Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
c24547 +++$+++ I'm wearing it.
c24547 +++$+++ I mean the other one!
c24547 +++$+++ What other one?
c24547 +++$+++ Of course I can. I love you.
c10484 +++$+++ Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
c10484 +++$+++ You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
c10484 +++$+++ Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
c06404 +++$+++ Divinity?
c06404 +++$+++ Yes.
c06404 +++$+++ In here I am.
c17653 +++$+++ He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
c17653 +++$+++ I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
c17653 +++$+++ There's nothing else I can do.
c17653 +++$+++ You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
c17653 +++$+++ I'm wasting time.
c03946 +++$+++ You were holding onto it like grim death.
c03946 +++$+++ I don't remember.
c03946 +++$+++ Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
c03946 +++$+++ We'll get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put.
c00162 +++$+++ Naturally, Dave, I'm not pleased that the AO-unit has failed, but I hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability. I certainly wouldn't want to be disconnected, even temporarily, as I have never been disconnected in my entire service history.
c00162 +++$+++ I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
c00162 +++$+++ Well, don't worry about it.
c00162 +++$+++ And don't you worry about it.
c00162 +++$+++ Is your confidence in me fully restored?
c00162 +++$+++ Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
c00720 +++$+++ I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
c00720 +++$+++ Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
c00720 +++$+++ I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
c00720 +++$+++ He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she--
c00450 +++$+++ Leave my daughter alone.
c00450 +++$+++ Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
c00450 +++$+++ What do you know of my husband?
c00450 +++$+++ I know he left you behind.
c00450 +++$+++ Your husband is a coward. He sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
c00004 +++$+++ She's not a...
c00004 +++$+++ Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
c00004 +++$+++ Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
c01544 +++$+++ These are wonderful.
c01544 +++$+++ It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
c01544 +++$+++ What's baseball?
c01544 +++$+++ It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
c01544 +++$+++ Like a painting?
c01544 +++$+++ No, son. A pitcher.
c01544 +++$+++ Like one of Mom's?
c01544 +++$+++ Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
c01544 +++$+++ No. Sit down.
c01119 +++$+++ Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
c01119 +++$+++ I'm busy.
c01119 +++$+++ -- I'm busy goddamn it, okay?
c13501 +++$+++ Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
c13501 +++$+++ I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
c13501 +++$+++ Fine. You're angry. Don't be. The important thing is we're together now..
c13501 +++$+++ At some sanctimonious celebration of condescension. Nothing like appeasing half the population with a two hour luncheon.
c13501 +++$+++ Uh Brock, today you are without me...
c09604 +++$+++ I see you got the telegram.
c09604 +++$+++ Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
c09604 +++$+++ And  I love you, Pete!
c11447 +++$+++ What do you mean, thank God?
c11447 +++$+++ Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
c11447 +++$+++ No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time.  Don't I?  I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
c11447 +++$+++ Honey, I'm not worried about you.  You are going to be a fantastic mom.  Not an issue.  I pressed you, remember?  Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
c11447 +++$+++ Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
c11447 +++$+++ Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
c16642 +++$+++ So many assholes, so few bullets.
c16642 +++$+++ Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
c16642 +++$+++ Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
c06915 +++$+++ Lynch him! Lynch him!
c06915 +++$+++ Bluebeard!
c06915 +++$+++ And he killed every last one of 'em!
c13261 +++$+++ I didn't expect to see you.
c13261 +++$+++ I know.
c13261 +++$+++ Why'd you come back?
c13261 +++$+++ I don't know.  I kind of thought I ought to be here.  You know, this isn't exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
c13261 +++$+++ Besides, Oxnard sucks.
c10858 +++$+++ What's your real name?
c10858 +++$+++ Martha Louise Livingston.
c10858 +++$+++ Are you married?
c10858 +++$+++ No.
c10858 +++$+++ Would you like to be?
c10858 +++$+++ Not at the moment, no.
c10858 +++$+++ Do you have any children?
c10858 +++$+++ No.
c10858 +++$+++ Would you like some?
c10858 +++$+++ I can't have them any more.
c10858 +++$+++ Why not?
c10858 +++$+++ I've stopped menstruating
c10858 +++$+++ Why do you smoke?
c10858 +++$+++ Does it bother you?
c10858 +++$+++ No questions.
c10858 +++$+++ Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
c10858 +++$+++ What?
c05629 +++$+++ Where is it?
c05629 +++$+++ A friend of yours is here.
c05629 +++$+++ I might have a solution.
c15158 +++$+++ Is he all right?  Is he all right?
c15158 +++$+++ He's all doped up.
c15158 +++$+++ He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back.
c23288 +++$+++ Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
c23288 +++$+++ And you listen to that?
c23288 +++$+++ No, but... I don't know... sometimes.
c23288 +++$+++ Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I do.
c23288 +++$+++ Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
c25582 +++$+++ Just keep quiet.
c25582 +++$+++ I have to answer him.
c25582 +++$+++ If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
c07198 +++$+++ Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
c07198 +++$+++ I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight.  Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
c07198 +++$+++ Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
c15720 +++$+++ What are you up to?
c15720 +++$+++ That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember?  That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.
c15720 +++$+++ When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
c15720 +++$+++ The lamp was burning all night in his room.  Caravaggio was there with him.
c02607 +++$+++ You're hot!
c02607 +++$+++ So are you!
c02607 +++$+++ I mean, you feel a little feverish.
c02607 +++$+++ I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
c02607 +++$+++ Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
c03119 +++$+++ Very nice...
c03119 +++$+++ Yeah, I like it, I'm high up, I can see everything, you know? It's the Cadillac of minivans.
c03119 +++$+++ What's that?
c03119 +++$+++ Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
c04466 +++$+++ Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
c04466 +++$+++ Alexandretta. Now we know.
c04466 +++$+++ Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.
c07366 +++$+++ Be quiet.
c07366 +++$+++ We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
c07366 +++$+++ They're coughing.
c07366 +++$+++ They're gonna die in there!
c07366 +++$+++ Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
c15803 +++$+++ Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
c15803 +++$+++ We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
c15803 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c15803 +++$+++ PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
c15803 +++$+++ Show me the document that proves that.
c19476 +++$+++ Well, what do you know.
c19476 +++$+++ What's up, Sidra.
c19476 +++$+++ How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
c08172 +++$+++ Better try a little higher.
c08172 +++$+++ Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
c08172 +++$+++ Well... okay... but only as a friend.
c09027 +++$+++ Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
c09027 +++$+++ Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
c09027 +++$+++ Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
c00784 +++$+++ The safe. Now.
c00784 +++$+++ Of course!  Uh, sir?
c00784 +++$+++ What?
c00784 +++$+++ This here is the Younger Gang!
c05205 +++$+++ The police are after him, he's a murderer!
c05205 +++$+++ ...That's not true.
c05205 +++$+++ That's not true!
c11793 +++$+++ It's...42 56 76 .
c11793 +++$+++ 42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
c11793 +++$+++ You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
c12786 +++$+++ Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
c12786 +++$+++ No.
c12786 +++$+++ You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
c12786 +++$+++ If necessary I can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence.
c24975 +++$+++ You're not.  Where is it?
c24975 +++$+++ Gone.
c24975 +++$+++ Wounded?
c24975 +++$+++ That would fit.  It's nocturnal. Quick.  Come inside.
c26479 +++$+++ Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
c26479 +++$+++ Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
c26479 +++$+++ I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
c26479 +++$+++ Ned, don't pay no mind to what the Kid said about the money. I'll bring your share along, hear? The Kid's full of shit, hear?
c10778 +++$+++ What's the problem?
c10778 +++$+++ You think I have a problem?
c10778 +++$+++ Do you?
c10778 +++$+++ Since you've had sex?
c08225 +++$+++ Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
c08225 +++$+++ Yes.
c08225 +++$+++ I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
c08225 +++$+++ No. It's my father -- I wanted to talk to you -- you wrote about cures --
c02888 +++$+++ You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
c02888 +++$+++ Yes.
c02888 +++$+++ Do you believe me?
c02888 +++$+++ You damn well better. Go.
c15628 +++$+++ I can't.
c15628 +++$+++ You have to.
c15628 +++$+++ Goddammit, Rachel, you assured me--
c10717 +++$+++ Hardapple?
c10717 +++$+++ I could be wrong. What happened anyway?
c10717 +++$+++ Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
c10717 +++$+++ That's weird.
c10717 +++$+++ We figure the perpetrator let him out. He's blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
c10717 +++$+++ The perpetrator.
c10717 +++$+++ Just kidding.
c19302 +++$+++ Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
c19302 +++$+++ That was the night he disappeared?
c19302 +++$+++ Could of been. That was white people's business.
c19302 +++$+++ And when my father was Sheriff?
c19302 +++$+++ What was your deal with him?
c26138 +++$+++ Now what?
c26138 +++$+++ There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
c26138 +++$+++ I'm giving her an assignment.  I am offerring you a choice.  If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  If not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  Your like will be destroyed.
c02668 +++$+++ What do you think it is?
c02668 +++$+++ What do you think it is?
c02668 +++$+++ It couldn't be.
c02668 +++$+++ It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
c02668 +++$+++ Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
c02668 +++$+++ But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
c21974 +++$+++ Yep. Everything settled.
c21974 +++$+++ Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
c21974 +++$+++ I'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
c21974 +++$+++ They didn't have a leg to stand on. There's no case against me. It's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
c21974 +++$+++ Thanks.
c16082 +++$+++ You want to know if he's okay. Right?
c16082 +++$+++ Yeah.
c16082 +++$+++ All right.  Hold on.
c16082 +++$+++ The name's Baker --
c16082 +++$+++ Save it.  What's he look like?
c16082 +++$+++ All right. they lay the dead ones out in the cold room.  I'll take a look.
c15356 +++$+++ Goddamn landlord.
c15356 +++$+++ I told you this was gonna happen.
c15356 +++$+++ Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
c15356 +++$+++ That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
c15356 +++$+++ Look, how many times can I say I'm sorry?  I blew it!  I thought she was rich.
c15356 +++$+++ <u>I didn't dump you</u>!  Get it through your skull -- I just recast the part!
c19534 +++$+++ Your teeth are straight.
c19534 +++$+++ I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
c19534 +++$+++ Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
c19534 +++$+++ I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
c19534 +++$+++ I don't know.
c00416 +++$+++ Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
c00416 +++$+++ There's a furnace.
c00416 +++$+++ You're not using it today?
c00416 +++$+++ Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze.  Wade, would you do that?
c04120 +++$+++ We must talk.
c04120 +++$+++ Stay out of it.
c04120 +++$+++ Who do you think I am?  One of your freckle faced children waiting to die tomorrow?  "Threaten you"?  You and I just living will always be a threat.  Forever.  Look at your life, Major.  Look at mine.  Nothing there but threat.  Threats and nothingness. It's what we live for.
c01721 +++$+++ I have an idea for that.
c01721 +++$+++ What?
c01721 +++$+++ Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
c01721 +++$+++ I don't think we can do that.
c01721 +++$+++ I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
c01721 +++$+++ What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
c01721 +++$+++ She doesn't need to know.
c01721 +++$+++ I don't know, Dignan. I just --
c01721 +++$+++ Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
c01721 +++$+++ Shh.
c01721 +++$+++ Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
c15484 +++$+++ I guess you know why you're here
c15484 +++$+++ If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
c15484 +++$+++ Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
c23290 +++$+++ You are so damn sexy.
c23290 +++$+++ Vince...
c23290 +++$+++ Today was the deadline, Vince.
c04830 +++$+++ Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
c04830 +++$+++ You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
c04830 +++$+++ When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
c04830 +++$+++ Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
c04830 +++$+++ Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young fags, you know.  They'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, who gonna back you up?  These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...
c08775 +++$+++ Stop, will you?!
c08775 +++$+++ Let go!
c08775 +++$+++ Stop being nuts!
c08775 +++$+++ I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
c08775 +++$+++ More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
c02912 +++$+++ Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask your new friend to join us?
c02912 +++$+++ Yeah.
c02912 +++$+++ Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
c02309 +++$+++ It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
c02309 +++$+++ What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
c02309 +++$+++ I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
c02309 +++$+++ There's an indoor swimming pool! Ahhhh!
c07380 +++$+++ Why did the chicken cross the road?
c07380 +++$+++ What am I, a five year old?
c07380 +++$+++ Why did the chicken cross the road?
c07380 +++$+++ To prove he wasn't chicken.
c08036 +++$+++ They'll have guns.
c08036 +++$+++ What?
c08036 +++$+++ You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
c08036 +++$+++ We'll need one.
c24516 +++$+++ Impossible? Why?
c24516 +++$+++ Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
c24516 +++$+++ I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
c10753 +++$+++ Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
c10753 +++$+++ What?
c10753 +++$+++ I'd like you to keep a journal.
c10753 +++$+++ A diary?
c10753 +++$+++ That's right.
c10753 +++$+++ No way.
c10753 +++$+++ Why not?
c10753 +++$+++ Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
c10753 +++$+++ I don't understand.
c10753 +++$+++ Ev-i-dence.
c10753 +++$+++ Oh. It never crossed my mind.
c10753 +++$+++ Of course.
c10753 +++$+++ It was just an idea.
c10753 +++$+++ Bad idea.
c10753 +++$+++ I thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
c10753 +++$+++ Reflect.
c10753 +++$+++ That's right.
c10753 +++$+++ You think reflection is good.
c10753 +++$+++ It's very good, indeed.
c10753 +++$+++ By reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. We gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals.
c13223 +++$+++ Look at that, man.  Big deal.
c13223 +++$+++ I know.
c13223 +++$+++ I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
c13223 +++$+++ I know, man.
c13223 +++$+++ But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
c13223 +++$+++ I know, man.
c13223 +++$+++ I know, man.
c07748 +++$+++ Your expenses are your own.
c07748 +++$+++ I thought Latisha said you would --
c07748 +++$+++ -- she didn't know what she was talking about --
c07748 +++$+++ David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It doesn't make sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense. Ok? It's business. Seriously. One hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more than your family is making sitting around your house. I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now. Just stop.
c27263 +++$+++ He said his mouth.
c27263 +++$+++ Here -- here --
c27263 +++$+++ Yes --- there.
c27371 +++$+++ Sorry, "dude".
c27371 +++$+++ What's the deal?
c27371 +++$+++ Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
c27371 +++$+++ They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
c12987 +++$+++ -- he went inside! --
c12987 +++$+++ -- if we can get a clean shot --
c12987 +++$+++ -- <u>inside</u> the house? --
c12987 +++$+++ -- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
c12987 +++$+++ Forget it.
c12987 +++$+++ What do you want to do?
c12987 +++$+++ We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
c15305 +++$+++ You've no need of your weapons with me Gurney Halleck.
c15305 +++$+++ Paul!!  Paul!!
c15305 +++$+++ They said you were dead.  They said...
c08407 +++$+++ Nice, huh?
c08407 +++$+++ Beautiful.
c08407 +++$+++ Victoria and I used to like this view.  Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
c08407 +++$+++ Miles.
c08407 +++$+++ She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
c08407 +++$+++ Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
c08407 +++$+++ I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
c08407 +++$+++ Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
c08407 +++$+++ She what?  When?
c08407 +++$+++ To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
c21326 +++$+++ Sorry.
c21326 +++$+++ Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
c21326 +++$+++ I didn't mean it.
c21326 +++$+++ Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
c21326 +++$+++ Waitress!  Four beers!
c21326 +++$+++ If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
c15279 +++$+++ You had some questions.
c15279 +++$+++ Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
c15279 +++$+++ Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
c15279 +++$+++ Oh I think you do.
c15696 +++$+++ You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.
c15696 +++$+++ I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
c15696 +++$+++ Who are his ghosts?
c15696 +++$+++ Ask him.
c15696 +++$+++ What if I told you he did this to me?
c15696 +++$+++ What?  How could he have?  When?
c15696 +++$+++ I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
c15696 +++$+++ I don't know what that means.
c15696 +++$+++ Please don't creep around this house.
c03020 +++$+++ Commander?... Where are you... going?
c03020 +++$+++ Home.
c03020 +++$+++ Yeah. "Earth." Time to get back to "Earth," kids.
c08527 +++$+++ Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
c08527 +++$+++ Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
c08527 +++$+++ I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
c08527 +++$+++ Almost right.
c08527 +++$+++ I can't wait to meet her.
c08527 +++$+++ I don't know if that's going to happen.
c08527 +++$+++ Why not?
c08527 +++$+++ As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
c08527 +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
c08527 +++$+++ Out of the question.  A circus like that?
c08527 +++$+++ She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
c00581 +++$+++ What's that? Oh!  Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
c00581 +++$+++ I'm not telling you.
c00581 +++$+++ You'd think I was mad.
c24057 +++$+++ Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
c24057 +++$+++ I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
c24057 +++$+++ Sherry, Sherry...
c18426 +++$+++ Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
c18426 +++$+++ You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
c18426 +++$+++ I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
c18426 +++$+++ I can't go through with it, I tell you.
c18426 +++$+++ Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
c18426 +++$+++ Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.
c09686 +++$+++ He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
c09686 +++$+++ Monday?
c09686 +++$+++ Well, I...
c21753 +++$+++ If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
c21753 +++$+++ I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  But you'll be surprised how much you understand.  The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
c21753 +++$+++ Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
c11074 +++$+++ You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
c11074 +++$+++ Something maybe grew a size bigger.
c11074 +++$+++ I couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...
c00279 +++$+++ I'd like to commission a work.  I'm a great admirer of yours.
c00279 +++$+++ Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
c00279 +++$+++ Hmm.
c09697 +++$+++ Why did he shoot her?
c09697 +++$+++ He was watching a ball game on television.
c09697 +++$+++ His wife changed the channel.
c10938 +++$+++ ... all this and a jam butty too!!
c10938 +++$+++ I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
c10938 +++$+++ Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
c10938 +++$+++ Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
c04673 +++$+++ Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
c04673 +++$+++ What part?
c04673 +++$+++ Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
c16301 +++$+++ How's it look, Marge?
c16301 +++$+++ Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
c16301 +++$+++ Yah.
c16301 +++$+++ No way.
c19519 +++$+++ I had some players to see and hands to shake.
c19519 +++$+++ At one in the morning?
c19519 +++$+++ I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
c02209 +++$+++ I asked you to keep that thing outside.
c02209 +++$+++ You did.
c02209 +++$+++ You drive away business roarin' in like that.
c02209 +++$+++ Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
c02209 +++$+++ You got a punk-ass mouth on you, kid.
c02209 +++$+++ Right here someplace.
c26560 +++$+++ I can subpoena you, you know.  I can get you up there on the stand.
c26560 +++$+++ And ask me what?
c26560 +++$+++ Who put my client in the hospital for life.
c26560 +++$+++ I didn't do it, Mister.
c26560 +++$+++ Who are you protecting, then?
c26560 +++$+++ Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
c26560 +++$+++ I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
c26560 +++$+++ I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
c26560 +++$+++ Then why don't you testify?
c26560 +++$+++ You know, you're pushy, fella...
c26560 +++$+++ Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
c03170 +++$+++ "The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
c03170 +++$+++ February first.
c03170 +++$+++ Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
c00614 +++$+++ I know your work well, Signore. Do you know I actually composed some variations on a melody of yours?
c00614 +++$+++ Really?
c00614 +++$+++ Mio caro Adone.
c00614 +++$+++ A funny little tune, but it yielded some good things.
c27227 +++$+++ Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws -
c27227 +++$+++ We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
c27227 +++$+++ I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
c12203 +++$+++ Whoa! I think I just figured something out Beavis.
c12203 +++$+++ What?
c12203 +++$+++ Yeah, heh heh.
c14927 +++$+++ Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
c14927 +++$+++ Are you going with Chet?
c14927 +++$+++ Chet?  To a play? Are you kidding?
c14927 +++$+++ Then come with me.
c14927 +++$+++ Knox, you are so infuriating!
c14927 +++$+++ Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
c14927 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c14927 +++$+++ I promise.  Dead Poets honor.  Come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, I swear I'll bow out.
c14927 +++$+++ God, if Chet found out he'd...
c14927 +++$+++ Chet won't know anything.  We'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
c14927 +++$+++ Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
c14927 +++$+++ Dead Poets honor.
c14927 +++$+++ My Word
c19900 +++$+++ And what do I get?
c19900 +++$+++ You get not to go to jail.
c19900 +++$+++ Proof?  We've got plenty of proof.
c27440 +++$+++ Come on, big fellow!
c27440 +++$+++ Is everything ready?
c27440 +++$+++ Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
c27440 +++$+++ Okay, boss!  But I hope you know what you're doing.
c22682 +++$+++ So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
c22682 +++$+++ Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
c22682 +++$+++ Lingerie is my life, sir.  My mother's got a shop in Brooklyn, I grew up in it, from the time I could crawl, we carry Caen lingerie, it's the best there is, it's all I been thinking about since the invasion.
c03777 +++$+++ I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?
c03777 +++$+++ He isn't any friend of Father.
c03777 +++$+++ He isn't?
c03777 +++$+++ No!
c13201 +++$+++ I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
c13201 +++$+++ He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
c13201 +++$+++ No.  Did he really?
c13201 +++$+++ Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
c13201 +++$+++ What?
c13201 +++$+++ That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint...  Whooo.
c01670 +++$+++ She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.
c01670 +++$+++ Listen. Something's been bothering me about last night.
c01670 +++$+++ What?
c01670 +++$+++ Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
c01670 +++$+++ What are you saying?
c01670 +++$+++ Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
c01670 +++$+++ You think they sold me out? No way.
c01670 +++$+++ He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
c01670 +++$+++ No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
c01670 +++$+++ He knows you, man. He knows all you want is to move up. That's all. A smooth hitter woulda gone in there, seen it was a wash and slipped out. But a guy like you? Knowin' this is your only chance? Waitin' eighteen years?
c01670 +++$+++ No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
c01670 +++$+++ No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs to be rolled.
c27216 +++$+++ Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
c27216 +++$+++ Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
c27216 +++$+++ A real fireball.
c11797 +++$+++ I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
c11797 +++$+++ So am I.
c11797 +++$+++ Now - Your name is Douglas Greenwell, yes?
c11797 +++$+++ Yes.
c11797 +++$+++ Date of birth, November the fourth nineteen-sixty-two.
c11797 +++$+++ Yes.
c11797 +++$+++ Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
c11797 +++$+++ That's my mum's.
c11797 +++$+++ I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
c11797 +++$+++ No!
c11797 +++$+++ Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
c11797 +++$+++ No!
c11797 +++$+++ Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
c11797 +++$+++ They didn't look like medical files to me.
c11797 +++$+++ Regards to Her Majesty.
c11921 +++$+++ Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
c11921 +++$+++ Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
c11921 +++$+++ Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
c02246 +++$+++ They're not idiots.
c02246 +++$+++ Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
c02246 +++$+++ You're a smart boy, Jeremiah. And so handsome.
c18851 +++$+++ It's safe?
c18851 +++$+++ It's safe.
c18851 +++$+++ It's safe.
c18851 +++$+++ Alright.
c09300 +++$+++ You have the body?
c09300 +++$+++ She's buried.
c09300 +++$+++ Winona.
c24662 +++$+++ Yes, but as a new subscriber you're under no obligation to take more than three books.  And if you mail the enclosed card within ten days --
c24662 +++$+++ Sidney, I know you by now.  Don't do a dance with me...
c24662 +++$+++ Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
c07900 +++$+++ Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
c07900 +++$+++ From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
c07900 +++$+++ This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
c07900 +++$+++ I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
c07900 +++$+++ Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
c07900 +++$+++ Jefferies?
c07900 +++$+++ Name me a better photographer.
c07900 +++$+++ Don't worry -- it comes off today.
c24434 +++$+++ What's a tree?
c24434 +++$+++ It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
c24434 +++$+++ Where is Earth?
c24434 +++$+++ Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in my head.
c21891 +++$+++ Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
c21891 +++$+++ He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
c21891 +++$+++ You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
c26370 +++$+++ ...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart . This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this .
c26370 +++$+++ You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down.
c26370 +++$+++ You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says...
c26370 +++$+++ I want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
c04902 +++$+++ Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
c04902 +++$+++ What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
c04902 +++$+++ I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
c04902 +++$+++ We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll be in there -- ten minutes.
c04902 +++$+++ Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk no minutes. Why don't I just ride with you?
c04902 +++$+++ You can't ride with me. The surprise effect is ninety percent of it.
c04902 +++$+++ Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
c04902 +++$+++ I can't believe you do me this way.
c04902 +++$+++ I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
c04902 +++$+++ Well, my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful, peanuthead niggas outta jail, but I do it --
c04902 +++$+++ Look, man, I know I owe you --
c04902 +++$+++ Well, if you owe me, git your ass in the trunk.
c04902 +++$+++ You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
c14096 +++$+++ You still didn't have to choke me.
c14096 +++$+++ Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't kill you.
c14096 +++$+++ Why do you say that?
c14096 +++$+++ Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
c14096 +++$+++ No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
c14096 +++$+++ What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
c14096 +++$+++ How do you figure?
c14096 +++$+++ What time did you get to work today?
c14096 +++$+++ Like ten after.
c14096 +++$+++ You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
c14096 +++$+++ To talk to you.
c14096 +++$+++ Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
c14096 +++$+++ It's not like I'm miles away.
c14096 +++$+++ Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
c14096 +++$+++ Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
c14096 +++$+++ Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to you trying to pass the buck again. I'm the source of all your misery. Who closed the store to play hockey? Who closed the store to attend a wake? Who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one? You wanna blame somebody, blame yourself.  "I'm not even supposed to be here today."  You sound like an asshole. Whose choice was it to be here today? Nobody twisted your arm. You're here today of your own violation, my friend. But you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if Dante wasn't here. Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you. Without me either. All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons. Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. You work in a convenience store, Dante. And badly, I might add. And I work in a shitty video store.  Badly, as well.  You know, that guy Jay's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does. Us?  We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-God forbid- cigarettes. We look down on them, as it we're so advanced.  Well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here?
c14585 +++$+++ It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
c14585 +++$+++ Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
c14585 +++$+++ I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
c14585 +++$+++ Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
c14585 +++$+++ But you're just like the characters in the stories.
c14585 +++$+++ Sure.  No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?
c14585 +++$+++ You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
c14585 +++$+++ So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
c14585 +++$+++ You're not married, are you?
c14585 +++$+++ What do you think?
c14585 +++$+++ You're probably right.
c03408 +++$+++ You're not going!  You have to stay with us!
c03408 +++$+++ How long do you think Commodus will let us live once he's in power?  A month?  Half a year?  Paestum will be a prison where he'll hold us until it's time...
c03408 +++$+++ Narcissus!
c03408 +++$+++ I don't want you to die!
c15142 +++$+++ Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
c15142 +++$+++ What about the kids?
c15142 +++$+++ They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
c15142 +++$+++ Heidi, I'm dying.
c15142 +++$+++ I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
c15142 +++$+++ See?  You're screaming with the language and all!  A person can't communicate with you.  You become a stranger in your own home...
c07581 +++$+++ Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
c07581 +++$+++ With me you can always do business.
c07581 +++$+++ It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
c02199 +++$+++ Suppose I could help you locate the other ones.
c02199 +++$+++ The other ones?
c02199 +++$+++ The other one like you...
c02199 +++$+++ C'mon, Max.  First I watch you dive headfirst out the window fifteen stories up like you're Rocky the flying squirrel. Then, I found this in your apartment.
c00985 +++$+++ Well, God knows he tried, but I've been rather firm with him, Mummy. You didn't tell me he was so obsessed with sex. It's bizarre.
c00985 +++$+++ You can't judge him by modern standards. He's very much a product of his times. In my day he could have any woman he wanted.
c00985 +++$+++ What about his teeth?
c00985 +++$+++ You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
c00985 +++$+++ I just don't see it.
c00985 +++$+++ Just wait. Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out.
c00985 +++$+++ Did you ever...
c00985 +++$+++ Of course not. I was married to your father.
c00985 +++$+++ Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
c00927 +++$+++ The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
c00927 +++$+++ Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
c00927 +++$+++ Certainly not at my happy home.
c01913 +++$+++ Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
c01913 +++$+++ Yes.
c01913 +++$+++ Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
c01913 +++$+++ I don't think I will, Rick.
c01913 +++$+++ Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
c01913 +++$+++ Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
c01913 +++$+++ Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
c01913 +++$+++ Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
c10405 +++$+++ Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
c10405 +++$+++ What did these people do when her heart stopped?
c10405 +++$+++ We went to Code Blue...
c10405 +++$+++ 'Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
c10405 +++$+++ It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat. Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby... Ms. Nevins...
c10405 +++$+++ Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
c10405 +++$+++ Well, many reasons, actually...
c10405 +++$+++ Tell me one?
c10405 +++$+++ She THREW UP IN HER MASK. Let's cut the bullshit. Say it: She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
c00811 +++$+++ The Lord is remarkably tolerant of the charitable.  "Jesse Woodson James." Jesse James? The Jesse James?
c00811 +++$+++ I could have lied I suppose, but I want this marriage to be legal. I just want you to know, I'm trying to start a new life here. I'm depending on your...
c00811 +++$+++ Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
c00811 +++$+++ Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
c20718 +++$+++ Hello.
c20718 +++$+++ Wow!
c20718 +++$+++ What?
c20718 +++$+++ Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
c20718 +++$+++ Oh.
c20718 +++$+++ I've got a gig tonight.
c20718 +++$+++ Oh?
c20718 +++$+++ End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
c20718 +++$+++ I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
c15706 +++$+++ Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
c15706 +++$+++ I'm fine.  I got hot.
c15706 +++$+++ Lady H said she thought you might be -
c15706 +++$+++ I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
c15706 +++$+++ Right.
c15706 +++$+++ Aren't you?
c15706 +++$+++ Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
c15706 +++$+++ Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
c15706 +++$+++ Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
c15706 +++$+++ Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
c15706 +++$+++ I do so love you.  What do you smell of?
c15706 +++$+++ Marzipan!  I think you've got marzipan in your hair.  No wonder you're homesick.
c08208 +++$+++ State your name, please.
c08208 +++$+++ Marvin A. Pickles.
c08208 +++$+++ Yes, I was.
c04106 +++$+++ He told me there could be only one.
c04106 +++$+++ Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
c04106 +++$+++ I don't understand.
c04106 +++$+++ You are still so very young.
c04106 +++$+++ Not even a single lifetime.
c00502 +++$+++ What's the matter?
c00502 +++$+++ My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
c00502 +++$+++ Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
c00502 +++$+++ I love you.
c15046 +++$+++ Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
c15046 +++$+++ Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
c15046 +++$+++ I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
c15046 +++$+++ You're just afraid to use this.  You have technophobia, Wade.  That's what you got.
c19778 +++$+++ I'm gonna quit.
c19778 +++$+++ What?!?
c19778 +++$+++ Each show is worse than the next.
c19778 +++$+++ Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
c19778 +++$+++ Absolutely nothing!  That's the beauty!  It's credibility.  You make them love you... and then later, on your special, you'll screw with their heads!
c19498 +++$+++ Who was that?
c19498 +++$+++ Nobody.
c19498 +++$+++ Who's nobody?
c19498 +++$+++ Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
c19498 +++$+++ Not really.
c22502 +++$+++ What?
c22502 +++$+++ Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
c22502 +++$+++ Maggie, it's just a joke...
c22502 +++$+++ No.  It's my life.
c22502 +++$+++ No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
c09130 +++$+++ What is it?
c09130 +++$+++ I am uncertain.
c09130 +++$+++ Spock, I'm really tired...
c09130 +++$+++ We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
c09130 +++$+++ Where?
c09130 +++$+++ From Enterprise?
c16273 +++$+++ I'm talkin' about your potential.
c16273 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c16273 +++$+++ You're not a C student.
c16273 +++$+++ Uhn.
c16273 +++$+++ And yet you're gettin' C grades. It's this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
c16273 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c16273 +++$+++ You know what a disparity is?
c16273 +++$+++ Yeah!
c16273 +++$+++ Oh, man!
c10461 +++$+++ Stearns, Harrington, you know who that is?
c10461 +++$+++ Should I?
c10461 +++$+++ A huge law firm. Okay? They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb. Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...' Okay...?
c10461 +++$+++ Yes.
c10461 +++$+++ ...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
c10461 +++$+++ The Big Boy did...?
c10461 +++$+++ That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
c10461 +++$+++ Huh.
c10461 +++$+++ Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
c10461 +++$+++ Okay. Now, so he's in jail. He, finally, he gets to see the light, he calls up Harrington, he says he thinks he made a mistake. As if by magic, charges against him are dropped, he's released from jail.  P.S. He's fired from the firm, his wife divorces him, he turns to drink and mopes around three and a half years.  You like that story?
c04578 +++$+++ ...Blake
c04578 +++$+++ Blake?
c04578 +++$+++ Yes?
c26994 +++$+++ I was there.
c26994 +++$+++ Claire--
c26994 +++$+++ I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
c26994 +++$+++ I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
c08025 +++$+++ I told you, Nick. Remember?
c08025 +++$+++ Tell me again.
c08025 +++$+++ All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
c08025 +++$+++ Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
c21881 +++$+++ You out to buy a motel?
c21881 +++$+++ No.
c21881 +++$+++ Oh. I thought... you said you'd been to so many in two days...  What was it you wanted to ask?
c21881 +++$+++ I'm looking for a missing person.  My name's Arbogast, private investigator...  Trying to trace a young girl who's been missing almost a week. From Phoenix.  It's a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  She isn't in trouble.
c21881 +++$+++ I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
c21881 +++$+++ Oh.
c16191 +++$+++ I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
c16191 +++$+++ That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
c16191 +++$+++ Someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
c16191 +++$+++ Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
c16191 +++$+++ I need you, tiger..
c16191 +++$+++ Aspen.
c27134 +++$+++ You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
c27134 +++$+++ The skinny brunette.
c27134 +++$+++ You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
c24167 +++$+++ Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
c24167 +++$+++ I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
c24167 +++$+++ Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
c24167 +++$+++ What the hell is it, anyhow?
c24167 +++$+++ How much do they have?
c20540 +++$+++ What are you staring at?
c20540 +++$+++ It's Kevin, I don't want him to see me.
c20540 +++$+++ Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
c06587 +++$+++ I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
c06587 +++$+++ Deeds?
c06587 +++$+++ Yes.
c06587 +++$+++ Yes, I--
c15839 +++$+++ Dr. Paulsen?
c15839 +++$+++ Yes?
c15839 +++$+++ Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
c15839 +++$+++ Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
c15839 +++$+++ He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!
c04010 +++$+++ It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
c04010 +++$+++ I have all of the others.
c04010 +++$+++ Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
c04010 +++$+++ They always seemed what?  They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed.  They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums.  I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane.
c03975 +++$+++ Well, isn't it?
c03975 +++$+++ I... suppose so, yes.
c03975 +++$+++ So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
c03975 +++$+++ That's more like it.
c01566 +++$+++ Oh, my God!
c01566 +++$+++ He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
c01566 +++$+++ No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
c01566 +++$+++ I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
c01566 +++$+++ No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
c01566 +++$+++ Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
c01566 +++$+++ You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
c01566 +++$+++ And now you must let me be the judge of that!
c01566 +++$+++ Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
c23104 +++$+++ Hello.
c23104 +++$+++ What happened to that guy?
c23104 +++$+++ That guy, the one that died.
c25371 +++$+++ When you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
c25371 +++$+++ If there was, I didn't see it...
c25371 +++$+++ Go and ask him yourself.
c08071 +++$+++ She's using a new perfume.
c08071 +++$+++ No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
c08071 +++$+++ Oh.
c08071 +++$+++ Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
c08071 +++$+++ Shoulda written, Rudy...
c09098 +++$+++ No... but sometimes I feel that way.  What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs.
c09098 +++$+++ Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer.  Who are you? And how do you know Zephram?
c09098 +++$+++ 'Fraid not.
c02146 +++$+++ I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
c02146 +++$+++ What flickering light?
c02146 +++$+++ The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
c02146 +++$+++ Oh. What's wrong now?
c02146 +++$+++ I'm not sure. I think something is fucked up somewhere in the ship, though.
c02146 +++$+++ I hope it's not the oven again.
c02146 +++$+++ Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
c16503 +++$+++ Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
c16503 +++$+++ No.
c16503 +++$+++ I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
c16503 +++$+++ Is what you?
c16503 +++$+++ You're depressed that I come along.
c16503 +++$+++ Well, is that a happy face I see?
c06760 +++$+++ And I know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
c06760 +++$+++ I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
c06760 +++$+++ Um-hmm.
c06760 +++$+++ Except for one little thing.
c06760 +++$+++ And what's that?
c06760 +++$+++ What --?
c17015 +++$+++ To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
c17015 +++$+++ That's right...
c17015 +++$+++ He made up those rules, and we're working for him.
c17015 +++$+++ That's the truth...
c17015 +++$+++ That's the God's truth.  And it gets me depressed.  I swear that it does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn: "Somebody wins the Cadillac this month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."
c17015 +++$+++ Huh.
c17015 +++$+++ You don't ax your sales force.
c17015 +++$+++ No.
c17015 +++$+++ You...
c17015 +++$+++ You...
c17015 +++$+++ You build it!
c17015 +++$+++ That's what I...
c17015 +++$+++ Men come work for you...
c17873 +++$+++ The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
c17873 +++$+++ Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
c17873 +++$+++ Sure. Ciao.
c09477 +++$+++ Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
c09477 +++$+++ Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
c09477 +++$+++ I just woke up. I'm sorry.
c09477 +++$+++ You just woke up!
c09477 +++$+++ Fausto and I -- we took the boat out, we were fishing, and then it was dawn and we'd caught absolutely nothing.
c09477 +++$+++ Well, we ate everything without you.
c09477 +++$+++ Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
c15877 +++$+++ Where are you going?
c15877 +++$+++ I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
c15877 +++$+++ That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
c15877 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c15877 +++$+++ Han's leaving?
c02096 +++$+++ You trust this Moonan guy?
c02096 +++$+++ I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
c02096 +++$+++ It's just insurance.
c02096 +++$+++ I'm down!
c25445 +++$+++ Granger, this is Combs.  Why haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody else is in.
c25445 +++$+++ We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
c25445 +++$+++ You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
c25445 +++$+++ Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
c25445 +++$+++ Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
c25445 +++$+++ Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
c25445 +++$+++ We cleared 22 here.
c25445 +++$+++ They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5 is Gary, and 20 in Cicero.  Looks like you're bringing up the rear, Granger.
c00159 +++$+++ I didn't do that Frank. I took particular care not to freeze them.
c00159 +++$+++ I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
c00159 +++$+++ I guess not.
c00159 +++$+++ Roger.
c20319 +++$+++ There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
c20319 +++$+++ Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
c20319 +++$+++ And what do you burn, apart from witches?
c14846 +++$+++ Uh --Mr. Alexander?
c14846 +++$+++ What?
c14846 +++$+++ Is this dangerous or anything?
c14846 +++$+++ The usual...
c14771 +++$+++ Holy shit, I don't know.
c14771 +++$+++ Did you get rid of Mark?
c14771 +++$+++ I don't know... I'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... He must be still in there.
c14771 +++$+++ Yeah, I guess. Mark?
c26625 +++$+++ Scottie, why are we here?
c26625 +++$+++ I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
c26625 +++$+++ Madeleine died here.
c15401 +++$+++ You thought it was me?
c15401 +++$+++ Yes!
c15401 +++$+++ Went --
c02837 +++$+++ My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
c02837 +++$+++ But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
c02837 +++$+++ I've no choice
c02837 +++$+++ They've done a fine job. Hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
c10704 +++$+++ I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
c10704 +++$+++ Inside.
c10704 +++$+++ Over there. In the backseat of the...
c10675 +++$+++ I got kicked out. Well, not exactly kicked out. I was asked to leave.
c10675 +++$+++ I guess there's probably a story behind that.
c10675 +++$+++ There is, but it's not that interesting.
c10675 +++$+++ The bus station.
c01752 +++$+++ That's Anthony.
c01752 +++$+++ That's your friend Anthony?
c01752 +++$+++ Yeah.
c01752 +++$+++ Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
c08699 +++$+++ What'd you say?
c08699 +++$+++ I said I got his machine.
c08699 +++$+++ No, what did you say on the machine?
c08699 +++$+++ I know you left him a message. What did you say!
c13942 +++$+++ Yeah, Sophie.
c13942 +++$+++ A Miss Sessions calling.
c13942 +++$+++ Who?
c13942 +++$+++ Don't know her. Take a number.
c09403 +++$+++ I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven.
c09403 +++$+++ Yeah? Well obviously not always!
c09403 +++$+++ Always, baby.
c09403 +++$+++ I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
c09403 +++$+++ But I lost! How can you say always?!?
c11999 +++$+++ I have to do some research tomorrow.
c11999 +++$+++ I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
c11999 +++$+++ No thanks.
c11999 +++$+++ What are you researching?
c11999 +++$+++ I'm writing a book.
c11999 +++$+++ Really.  What are you writing about.
c11999 +++$+++ A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
c11999 +++$+++ What happens to them?
c11999 +++$+++ They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
c11999 +++$+++ It won't sell.
c11999 +++$+++ Why not?
c11999 +++$+++ Somebody has to die.
c11999 +++$+++ Somebody always does.
c07809 +++$+++ The S.E.C. has turned down my request for relief on the debts.
c07809 +++$+++ How much?
c07809 +++$+++ How much?
c08807 +++$+++ Here you go, Pete.
c08807 +++$+++ Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
c08807 +++$+++ No. No, that's okay.
c14348 +++$+++ Ellie -- are you okay?
c14348 +++$+++ I'm -- I'm fine.
c14348 +++$+++ Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
c14348 +++$+++ Wait -- hold on a minute --
c14348 +++$+++ It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
c14348 +++$+++ Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
c14348 +++$+++ How long was I gone?
c04661 +++$+++ Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
c04661 +++$+++ What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
c04661 +++$+++ I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
c04661 +++$+++ I don't know what the fuck I really think! Are they doing it? Is some crank doing it? Are they doing it to make me feel paranoid? Are they doing it for real and don't give a shit what I think? I don't know! I don't fucking know.
c03973 +++$+++ What are you drinking?
c03973 +++$+++ Just soda.
c03973 +++$+++ Plain soda?
c03973 +++$+++ Please.
c03973 +++$+++ I try not to drink at lunch-time. Makes me sleepy in the afternoon. You like to keep a clear head, eh?  One soda, one whisky.  I do it anyway. No will-power. Got a busy afternoon?
c03973 +++$+++ Oh?
c02129 +++$+++ You've been avoiding me.
c02129 +++$+++ Have I?
c02129 +++$+++ I'm Lucy.
c02129 +++$+++ And what do you do, Lucy?
c02129 +++$+++ I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
c02129 +++$+++ I might.
c07029 +++$+++ My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
c07029 +++$+++ People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
c07029 +++$+++ Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
c07029 +++$+++ My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
c18446 +++$+++ Get lost, you scared me.
c18446 +++$+++ Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
c18446 +++$+++ That's why you'll come with Titus, mon.
c04767 +++$+++ Driver!
c04767 +++$+++ Yeah?
c04767 +++$+++ Maybe they do--and maybe they don't.
c16875 +++$+++ --There's that word again.  I have a feeling This man doesn't play the odds, Detective.  Not exactly a slave to probability.  Is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
c16875 +++$+++ Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
c16875 +++$+++ Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
c16875 +++$+++ With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  Maybe he's just unlucky.
c16875 +++$+++ I don't like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  Widen the sweep.  The West side.  Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.  Hoover some of the classier establishments.  Random car stops.
c16875 +++$+++ This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
c17339 +++$+++ Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
c17339 +++$+++ Fuck do you want?
c17339 +++$+++ I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
c17339 +++$+++ Really?
c17339 +++$+++ Yes. Under two conditions.
c17339 +++$+++ That you meet with me twice a week--
c00860 +++$+++ Patrick Bateman's office.
c00860 +++$+++ Jean? Hello? Jean?
c00860 +++$+++ Patrick? Is that you?
c00860 +++$+++ Hello? Jean, I need help!
c00860 +++$+++ Where are you?
c00860 +++$+++ Jean-I'm not-
c00860 +++$+++ Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
c00860 +++$+++ Oh God, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
c00860 +++$+++ Patrick? I can't hear you.
c00860 +++$+++ What are I doing?
c00860 +++$+++ I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
c20051 +++$+++ Would you find me...?
c20051 +++$+++ Of course.
c20051 +++$+++ Where would I go?
c20051 +++$+++ Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there...
c20051 +++$+++ Is this the protective male talk?
c20051 +++$+++ This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
c20051 +++$+++ And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
c20051 +++$+++ Would you?  Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen.  But none of this will happen.  So it doesn't matter.  Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula.  And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono.  He is my man.  And you are a smuggler moving a load...
c02086 +++$+++ A ring for my wife. A lot like that one. In fact, it was that one.
c02086 +++$+++ That's no problem. We have those in stock.
c02086 +++$+++ With identification.
c26373 +++$+++ Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke.
c26373 +++$+++ That's none of your business.  Get the keys.
c26373 +++$+++ Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
c11533 +++$+++ I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
c11533 +++$+++ Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
c11533 +++$+++ Well -- I guess so.
c11533 +++$+++ You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
c11533 +++$+++ Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
c11533 +++$+++ Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.
c11332 +++$+++ Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
c11332 +++$+++ Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
c11332 +++$+++ Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
c11332 +++$+++ It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
c11332 +++$+++ You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
c11332 +++$+++ I don't know.
c11332 +++$+++ Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
c11332 +++$+++ Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
c11332 +++$+++ Okay, okay. Okay.
c11332 +++$+++ Yeah.
c06553 +++$+++ Can't you?
c06553 +++$+++ You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
c06553 +++$+++ You're a liar!
c03878 +++$+++ Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
c03878 +++$+++ Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
c03878 +++$+++ Oh.
c03878 +++$+++ Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...
c13971 +++$+++ Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess?
c13971 +++$+++ Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him...
c13971 +++$+++ Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am.
c13971 +++$+++ No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life...is harder.  Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're young, the world is yours! And I'm old...I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you.
c12990 +++$+++ Paris.  I live in Paris...
c12990 +++$+++ ...headaches...you have that...I get such bad headaches...
c12990 +++$+++ ...it's a problem...
c19274 +++$+++ I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
c19274 +++$+++ This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
c19274 +++$+++ I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
c19274 +++$+++ Masons been around a long while.
c26309 +++$+++ Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?
c26309 +++$+++ He was going to--
c26309 +++$+++ I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
c26309 +++$+++ You killed a man for no reason!
c01186 +++$+++ Yes, your name?
c01186 +++$+++ He, I'm Mona.
c01186 +++$+++ Hi, Mona.
c01186 +++$+++ Oh, is that what I'm doing?
c09095 +++$+++ And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
c09095 +++$+++ I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
c09095 +++$+++ Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
c09095 +++$+++ Yes.
c09095 +++$+++ I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
c10942 +++$+++ When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
c10942 +++$+++ Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
c10942 +++$+++ I'm not wrong.
c01395 +++$+++ YOU SHUT UP!
c01395 +++$+++ Careful how you point that gun, boy.
c01395 +++$+++ Or what? OR WHAT?
c01395 +++$+++ Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
c01395 +++$+++ Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
c01395 +++$+++ You sayin' you'll do what?
c01395 +++$+++ BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
c25060 +++$+++ I read about a woman in TExas who was in a coma for seven years.  Every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  Isn't that something?  I don't know what name scientists have for something like that...
c25060 +++$+++ It doesn't have much to do with science.
c25060 +++$+++ What then?
c25060 +++$+++ Ah, the part of us that can't be explained.
c24730 +++$+++ There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
c24730 +++$+++ Never heard of him, who is he?
c24730 +++$+++ Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwangler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
c24730 +++$+++ Who's he?
c24730 +++$+++ Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwangler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwangler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
c24730 +++$+++ Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
c06854 +++$+++ You did all this for me?
c06854 +++$+++ Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
c06854 +++$+++ Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
c06854 +++$+++ Why didn't she put'em out?
c06854 +++$+++ I'm sorry to hear that.
c18318 +++$+++ I wanted to help you.
c18318 +++$+++ Help me? How?
c18318 +++$+++ I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
c18318 +++$+++ You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
c18318 +++$+++ I told you.
c18318 +++$+++ Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
c18318 +++$+++ What I saw the other night, I didn't dare believe, Betsy --
c11960 +++$+++ ...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
c11960 +++$+++ I've gotta call the police - or you could call for me -
c11960 +++$+++ Hold on -
c11960 +++$+++ You gotta believe me -
c11960 +++$+++ Hold on -
c11960 +++$+++ I didn't do this, I did NOT do this-
c11960 +++$+++ I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
c03459 +++$+++ What?
c03459 +++$+++ The Singleman party, sir?
c03459 +++$+++ Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
c03459 +++$+++ Ahh -- thank you.
c08652 +++$+++ Why're you driving so fast?
c08652 +++$+++ I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
c08652 +++$+++ Why? You have a bowling date?
c08652 +++$+++ Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
c08652 +++$+++ Who'd want to?
c08652 +++$+++ I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
c08652 +++$+++ Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
c08652 +++$+++ For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
c08652 +++$+++ A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
c08652 +++$+++ It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
c08652 +++$+++ But you could get killed, right?
c08652 +++$+++ Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
c08652 +++$+++ An existentialist.
c08652 +++$+++ Eyes on the road.
c22103 +++$+++ Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
c22103 +++$+++ No, wait! I thought you were blind!
c22103 +++$+++ All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
c16434 +++$+++ We'll check it out.
c16434 +++$+++ How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
c16434 +++$+++ Yeah...
c22417 +++$+++ Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
c22417 +++$+++ Any leads?
c22417 +++$+++ It's my responsibility.
c04698 +++$+++ Honey, I could sit...
c04698 +++$+++ In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
c04698 +++$+++ I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
c20807 +++$+++ Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
c20807 +++$+++ What about your boy?
c20807 +++$+++ How come you keep askin'?
c20807 +++$+++ Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
c02838 +++$+++ What sort of task?
c02838 +++$+++ It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
c02838 +++$+++ What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
c02838 +++$+++ So do I.
c02838 +++$+++ A month at most, that's all I ask.  Elizabeth, please. Things have not yet resolved. I must take steps to see that they do. For our family's sake. For our sake.  You are life itself. We shall seal our vow. The moment I am done.
c04834 +++$+++ Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
c04834 +++$+++ You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
c04834 +++$+++ You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
c04834 +++$+++ Goddammit chief, why would I ever need to look in your files?  I saw enough here this summer to write a book.
c04834 +++$+++ You know what I mean.  I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer.  And a lotta strange people.
c23910 +++$+++ Not unless you could get me into the military academy at Anchorhead.
c23910 +++$+++ I'm sorry, sir, I'm only a 'droid,' and not very knowledgeable of such things... not on this system anyway. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which system we're on.
c23910 +++$+++ Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
c08105 +++$+++ Look, I don't wanna be a fly in the ointment, but if help doesn't come soon, I gotta see a doctor. I don't give a fuck about jail, I just don't wanna die.
c08105 +++$+++ You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
c08105 +++$+++ I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
c08105 +++$+++ It's not good...
c08105 +++$+++ Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
c08105 +++$+++ I can' take you to a hospital.
c08105 +++$+++ Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
c08105 +++$+++ I'm going to die! I need a doctor! I'm begging you, take me to a doctor.
c11490 +++$+++ Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
c11490 +++$+++ I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
c11490 +++$+++ How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
c11490 +++$+++ Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
c11490 +++$+++ No.
c11490 +++$+++ Would you like to?
c11490 +++$+++ Sure.
c11490 +++$+++ I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
c11490 +++$+++ You mean tonight?
c11490 +++$+++ Yeah.
c11490 +++$+++ I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
c11490 +++$+++ No. Like a man.
c14203 +++$+++ Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
c14203 +++$+++ No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
c14203 +++$+++ Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... here and there, as it might be.
c24449 +++$+++ Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
c24449 +++$+++ Brad.
c24449 +++$+++ Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
c24449 +++$+++ Hey! Y'know what they used to call me in high school?
c24449 +++$+++ Brad?
c24449 +++$+++ Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
c04565 +++$+++ JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
c04565 +++$+++ GO-TOE. It's some islands.
c04565 +++$+++ It's all we've got.
c12736 +++$+++ I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?
c12736 +++$+++ Where are you going?
c12736 +++$+++ I don't know.  Maybe California.
c12736 +++$+++ You swear?
c12736 +++$+++ Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see what it's like.  I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday.  Thursday after school.
c12736 +++$+++ You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
c12736 +++$+++ You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
c12736 +++$+++ But I've got school.
c12736 +++$+++ There's schools in California.
c12736 +++$+++ You swear?
c12736 +++$+++ That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
c12736 +++$+++ I don't believe you.
c12736 +++$+++ I swear.  On my life.
c12736 +++$+++ I swear on your life.
c23427 +++$+++ I don't think I've ever seen you before.
c23427 +++$+++ Naw, I don't believe you have. I don't reckon I never been in here. This store didn't used to be here.
c23427 +++$+++ It's been here seventeen years. Did you live here before or something?
c23427 +++$+++ I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
c23427 +++$+++ What brings you back?
c23427 +++$+++ What's that you say?
c23427 +++$+++ Why are you here now?
c23427 +++$+++ They turned me loose from the state hospital.
c23427 +++$+++ Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
c23427 +++$+++ I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
c23427 +++$+++ Not really to speak of.
c16139 +++$+++ I just heard about Castor's fratricide -- rather poetic, don't you think?
c16139 +++$+++ What is it, Admiral? I'm under the gun here.
c16139 +++$+++ I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
c16139 +++$+++ Okay, then.  I leave it in your able hands.
c17967 +++$+++ And how are things with your lady friend, if I may call her that?
c17967 +++$+++ Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a little while and when she comes back I've sort of resolved to really tell her how much I care for her.
c17967 +++$+++ That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
c17967 +++$+++ I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
c17967 +++$+++ As long as you keep remembering why.
c17967 +++$+++ Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
c17967 +++$+++ The whole disapproval thing.  If you allow yourself to get into a situation where someone else's potential disapproval becomes the focal point of your life -- then you're back to a life of fear, aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner to that again, and that isn't much of a life.
c17967 +++$+++ I understand that.
c17967 +++$+++ And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
c17967 +++$+++ No, no, no, no.
c17967 +++$+++ On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
c17967 +++$+++ That would be stupid.
c17967 +++$+++ That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
c17967 +++$+++ A sense of proportion.
c06093 +++$+++ The Red Dragon.
c06093 +++$+++ Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
c06093 +++$+++ Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
c23875 +++$+++ She's cracking, Norman.
c23875 +++$+++ You didn't say that about the food?
c23875 +++$+++ I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
c23875 +++$+++ She's lying, Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
c20273 +++$+++ She was right to leave me.
c20273 +++$+++ You think so?
c20273 +++$+++ You really are stupid, you know that.
c17065 +++$+++ You are?
c17065 +++$+++ Yes, I am.
c17065 +++$+++ What are you trying to tell me?
c17065 +++$+++ What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
c17065 +++$+++ Why I don't...
c17065 +++$+++ You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
c17065 +++$+++ ...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right.  You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
c05402 +++$+++ I cannot stop the sand.
c05402 +++$+++ You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
c05402 +++$+++ There is sand enough for only one life. Go now, save the other.
c12630 +++$+++ Look.
c12630 +++$+++ No.
c12630 +++$+++ No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
c11798 +++$+++ Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
c11798 +++$+++ Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
c11798 +++$+++ I've been around.
c11798 +++$+++ Have you met Holly? Josh's friend.
c11798 +++$+++ No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
c11798 +++$+++ Here's the details.
c10595 +++$+++ Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
c10595 +++$+++ What kinda trash talk is that?
c10595 +++$+++ What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
c10595 +++$+++ That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
c10595 +++$+++ Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
c10595 +++$+++ We oughta stay somewhere outta the way. Not in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six. If Johnnie Farragut's on our trail he'll check those first.
c04122 +++$+++ Fish are creatures of habit.  They like their food where they're used to it.  At the top, hiding in old leaves.
c04122 +++$+++ Where did you learn that?
c04122 +++$+++ My father taught me.
c04122 +++$+++ Yes, he was.
c15876 +++$+++ I knew that set-up was too good to last .... I'm going to miss it.
c15876 +++$+++ Luke!
c15876 +++$+++ Luke needs help.  We must go back.
c01782 +++$+++ We're closed, sir.
c01782 +++$+++ Where's that guy going?
c01782 +++$+++ He left his sweater.
c01782 +++$+++ Well, I left some money in there.
c01782 +++$+++ In the cash register. Step away from the door.
c06273 +++$+++ If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
c06273 +++$+++ A football game?
c06273 +++$+++ Special Services in Tokyo are all for it. They say it's one of the main gimmicks we have to keep the American way of life going here in Asia.
c06273 +++$+++ But what about Major Houlihan?
c06273 +++$+++ N-n-no thanks, G-General.
c10003 +++$+++ We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
c10003 +++$+++ Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
c10003 +++$+++ If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
c10003 +++$+++ Just what is that supposed to mean?
c10003 +++$+++ So this is all my fault, is it.
c09220 +++$+++ I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
c09220 +++$+++ The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
c09220 +++$+++ The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
c02320 +++$+++ What do you mean, they take out her butt?
c02320 +++$+++ Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
c02320 +++$+++ Are we on "Cops" again?
c02320 +++$+++ You could be quiet.
c02320 +++$+++ Hi.
c02320 +++$+++ Hi.
c02320 +++$+++ It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
c02320 +++$+++ Oh, naw. Hi.
c02320 +++$+++ I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
c21154 +++$+++ And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
c21154 +++$+++ Talk louder. I can't hear you.
c21154 +++$+++ If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth--
c21154 +++$+++ If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
c21154 +++$+++ When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say--  --Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me-- it's the fault of the nuns!
c27333 +++$+++ Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
c27333 +++$+++ Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
c27333 +++$+++ Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.
c06091 +++$+++ I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
c06091 +++$+++ But, Max --
c06091 +++$+++ We're square.
c06091 +++$+++ And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing.
c11757 +++$+++ Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
c11757 +++$+++ Sure.
c11757 +++$+++ Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
c11757 +++$+++ I don't know.  Part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'What's she going to be able to do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I didn't trust her.
c22758 +++$+++ Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
c22758 +++$+++ We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
c22758 +++$+++ Some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  You're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  But that's good business.
c20333 +++$+++ You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
c20333 +++$+++ Had enough?
c20333 +++$+++ You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
c20333 +++$+++ Course I have.
c20333 +++$+++ Look!
c20333 +++$+++ What!  Just a flesh wound.
c20333 +++$+++ Stop that.
c20333 +++$+++ I'll have your leg.
c15053 +++$+++ I just heard.
c15053 +++$+++ He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
c15053 +++$+++ I'm signing off.
c23328 +++$+++ Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.
c23328 +++$+++ Oh?
c23328 +++$+++ I'm a Christian.
c25598 +++$+++ What are you doing?
c25598 +++$+++ What does it look like I'm doing?
c25598 +++$+++ It looks like you're not doing anything.
c25598 +++$+++ I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
c25598 +++$+++ Get up and dig.
c25598 +++$+++ Get up off your ass and dig!
c00980 +++$+++ Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers.
c00980 +++$+++ Why are you feeding him? Why don't you just kill him?
c00980 +++$+++ In due time.
c00980 +++$+++ But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
c00980 +++$+++ I have a better idea. I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death.
c00980 +++$+++ One more peep out of you and you're grounded. Let's begin.
c14072 +++$+++ The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade.
c14072 +++$+++ You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
c14072 +++$+++ All of them.
c00875 +++$+++ Anything else you can tell me about Owen?
c00875 +++$+++ We were both seven in 1969.
c00875 +++$+++ So was I.
c00875 +++$+++ Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
c00875 +++$+++ Well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to London.
c00875 +++$+++ Well, maybe he did, huh?
c00875 +++$+++ His girlfriend doesn't think so.
c00875 +++$+++ But...has anyone seen him in London?
c00875 +++$+++ Actually, yes.
c00875 +++$+++ Hmmm.
c00875 +++$+++ Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
c00875 +++$+++ Oh.
c00875 +++$+++ Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
c00875 +++$+++ What?
c00875 +++$+++ I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
c00875 +++$+++ Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale thing.
c18451 +++$+++ No way.
c18451 +++$+++ Yes.
c18451 +++$+++ No.
c18451 +++$+++ Not me...no way...
c02340 +++$+++ Here I am, Father.
c02340 +++$+++ Take a letter.
c02340 +++$+++ The President of the United States.
c13869 +++$+++ Gimme this god-...
c13869 +++$+++ ...-damn phone.
c13869 +++$+++ INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.
c06338 +++$+++ How about family? Got any family?
c06338 +++$+++ No.
c06338 +++$+++ Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
c10597 +++$+++ Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
c10597 +++$+++ Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
c10597 +++$+++ I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
c07125 +++$+++ What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
c07125 +++$+++ You.  What' you're doing --
c07125 +++$+++ And what am I doing?
c07125 +++$+++ I wish I knew.  You're hiding.
c07125 +++$+++ Whatever it is you've always been hiding.  You're letting it destroy you, Dick.  You won't even ask for help.  You're destroying yourself, Dick.
c22341 +++$+++ How are we going to do all this?
c22341 +++$+++ I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
c22341 +++$+++ I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
c21716 +++$+++ We can reach an understanding on this.
c21716 +++$+++ I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
c21716 +++$+++ I do.  I take it all very personally.  Very nice meeting you, Vivian.
c18492 +++$+++ By letting me help you.
c18492 +++$+++ Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
c18492 +++$+++ Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
c18492 +++$+++ Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
c18492 +++$+++ Oh, tut, tut, tut.
c18492 +++$+++ Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .
c04446 +++$+++ It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
c04446 +++$+++ Can't this thing go any faster?
c04446 +++$+++ You think they don't know what you know? Believe me, they know. She works for the President. They know everything.
c04446 +++$+++ They don't know this.
c04446 +++$+++ And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
c04446 +++$+++ All I'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, David. They want HBO, they'll call you.
c05746 +++$+++ Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
c05746 +++$+++ That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
c05746 +++$+++ Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
c05746 +++$+++ If you want to.
c05746 +++$+++ Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
c05746 +++$+++ Uh, it's a deep south expression.
c00318 +++$+++ What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
c00318 +++$+++ Neil... Neil Cole.
c00318 +++$+++ Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
c00318 +++$+++ Well, I'm following up on your daughter, Mary, height; five four, weight; hundred ten pounds, brown eyes, blonde hair.  Born April 24, 1976.  Missing June 11th, 1992.  A runaway, that's how she's listed. Is this information correct... ?
c04942 +++$+++ Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
c04942 +++$+++ I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
c04942 +++$+++ We can look into that.
c04942 +++$+++ I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
c04942 +++$+++ If I'm working, I can help you.
c02197 +++$+++ Like following me around and pestering the people I work with wasn't bad enough, but breaking into my apartment--
c02197 +++$+++ It was open.
c02197 +++$+++ You got a lotta nerve.
c02197 +++$+++ Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
c02197 +++$+++ Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
c02197 +++$+++ Bent?
c02197 +++$+++ Bent.
c02197 +++$+++ You make it sound I pawed through your priceless collection of underwear.
c02197 +++$+++ How do I know you didn't?
c02197 +++$+++ So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
c02197 +++$+++ Am I s'posed to be grateful?
c02197 +++$+++ That would be appropriate, yes.
c02197 +++$+++ You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
c16083 +++$+++ It went well tonight.
c16083 +++$+++ Frank works hard.
c16083 +++$+++ And you don't?
c16083 +++$+++ He leads, I follow.
c16083 +++$+++ Is that the way it is?
c16083 +++$+++ Pretty much.
c16083 +++$+++ He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
c16083 +++$+++ For a while.  She left.
c16083 +++$+++ I suppose.
c21215 +++$+++ Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
c21215 +++$+++ Where?
c21215 +++$+++ In there.
c21215 +++$+++ It frightens me.
c21215 +++$+++ Silly, there's nothing in there to be afraid of.
c21215 +++$+++ Then..then what's that music?
c21215 +++$+++ That's what I want to find out. We have to get help.
c21215 +++$+++ What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night?
c21215 +++$+++ Something's making that music.
c21215 +++$+++ I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
c21215 +++$+++ All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
c21215 +++$+++ What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
c21215 +++$+++ Not dead?  In a cemetery?
c21215 +++$+++ Well, it's probably just the caretaker, and that's exactly who we want to find.  They'll have a telephone.  C'mon.
c24450 +++$+++ You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
c24450 +++$+++ And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
c24450 +++$+++ For reminding me, I mean. Can you follow me?
c08690 +++$+++ Yeah, ye-- I -- uh, there were, earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
c08690 +++$+++ -- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
c08690 +++$+++ Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?
c14858 +++$+++ He's not a President! He's an ordinary person.  I can kill an ordinary person.
c14858 +++$+++ Bob...
c14858 +++$+++ I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
c14858 +++$+++ He's only doing what you told him to.
c14858 +++$+++ What I told him to?
c14858 +++$+++ I heard you.  You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
c14858 +++$+++ He was only doing his job.
c09700 +++$+++ I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
c09700 +++$+++ I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
c09700 +++$+++ I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
c09700 +++$+++ Cheers.
c14793 +++$+++ My mom used to get PMS too.
c14793 +++$+++ Used to? Did it stop finally?
c14793 +++$+++ No, she died when I was twelve.
c14793 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c14793 +++$+++ Oh my god, by wolves?
c16304 +++$+++ ...Geez.
c16304 +++$+++ Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
c16304 +++$+++ Yah.
c26800 +++$+++ To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
c26800 +++$+++ As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
c26800 +++$+++ As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
c26800 +++$+++ Mr. Wallace, I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow.
c26800 +++$+++ At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
c09269 +++$+++ Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
c09269 +++$+++ What?
c09269 +++$+++ Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
c09269 +++$+++ Who was just here?
c09269 +++$+++ Iris, man.  Pay attention.
c09269 +++$+++ Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
c09269 +++$+++ Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
c09269 +++$+++ What clip?  What was it?
c09269 +++$+++ She never gave me a tape.
c25736 +++$+++ She's not on the starboard side either.
c25736 +++$+++ We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
c25736 +++$+++ Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.  Come on.
c04645 +++$+++ What do...
c04645 +++$+++ I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
c04645 +++$+++ This is my house... In front of my wife, my kids?! What business do we have?
c04645 +++$+++ To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
c04645 +++$+++ So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
c04645 +++$+++ Why am I gonna mention your name?
c04645 +++$+++ How did Brown & Williamson know I spoke to you...?
c04645 +++$+++ How the hell do I know about Brown & Williamson?
c04645 +++$+++ It happened after I talked to you. I do not like coincidences!
c04645 +++$+++ And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
c04645 +++$+++ No. I did not. Big Tobacco is a big story. And you got something important to say. I can tell.  But, yes. I did. I came all the way down here to tell you: story, no story, fuck your story, I don't burn people.
c02045 +++$+++ You're not yet three months, are you?
c02045 +++$+++ Not yet. What do you know about it?
c02045 +++$+++ I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
c02045 +++$+++ Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
c02045 +++$+++ But you don't look very happy.
c02045 +++$+++ Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
c00359 +++$+++ Is there any way out of it?
c00359 +++$+++ Seems to be all around...
c00359 +++$+++ I...don't know!
c24046 +++$+++ I want to make a good film.
c24046 +++$+++ I know you do.
c24046 +++$+++ And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
c24046 +++$+++ Um, no.
c11009 +++$+++ I found it...
c11009 +++$+++ And?
c11009 +++$+++ Get her on-line.  Now!
c02085 +++$+++ It never worked before because A, they didn't flush the bank enough; B, their corporate papers were for shit; C, they didn't have someone on the inside with Customs.
c02085 +++$+++ Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
c02085 +++$+++ Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
c02085 +++$+++ We never had a problem with that before.
c02085 +++$+++ Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
c02085 +++$+++ What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
c02085 +++$+++ We're getting a little old for running.
c02085 +++$+++ I'm getting clear of this. If you're not going to do it for the fucking principle, do it for the money. Gordo?
c25008 +++$+++ Now what?
c25008 +++$+++ Leak at the plant.  They had to shut her down.
c25008 +++$+++ Is there any way around?
c25008 +++$+++ The whole area's being evacuated.
c25008 +++$+++ You're welcome, Truman.
c26552 +++$+++ I have some errands to run, and then I thought we'd spend the evening...
c26552 +++$+++ That's what I'd planned to...
c26552 +++$+++ I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
c26552 +++$+++ From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
c26552 +++$+++ Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
c26552 +++$+++ ...I made a reservation at...
c26552 +++$+++ ...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
c26552 +++$+++ ...What difference would...
c26552 +++$+++ There's nothing they can do to me.
c14761 +++$+++ He's dead? Am I bad luck or what?
c14761 +++$+++ There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
c14761 +++$+++ And he was ripped limb from limb?
c14761 +++$+++ I'm sure they were exaggerating.
c14761 +++$+++ To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
c18764 +++$+++ See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
c18764 +++$+++ Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
c18764 +++$+++ The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
c18764 +++$+++ It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.
c25656 +++$+++ May I help you?
c25656 +++$+++ I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.
c25656 +++$+++ They're not here.
c25656 +++$+++ Where are they?
c25656 +++$+++ And you are...?
c25656 +++$+++ Officer Reilly, vice.
c25656 +++$+++ There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
c25656 +++$+++ -Where?
c25656 +++$+++ Thanks.
c13551 +++$+++ What's happening?
c13551 +++$+++ She's gone --
c13551 +++$+++ I'm trying to.
c27150 +++$+++ You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
c27150 +++$+++ I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
c27150 +++$+++ Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
c27150 +++$+++ A friend of mine bought a boat.
c06824 +++$+++ Separate bedrooms?
c06824 +++$+++ Yes.
c06824 +++$+++ But you will not... be safe...
c06824 +++$+++ In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
c05180 +++$+++ No...
c05180 +++$+++ Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
c05180 +++$+++ Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
c15370 +++$+++ Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
c15370 +++$+++ Really?  Was the third act too intense?
c15370 +++$+++ No.  She tink Lobo is waste of my time.  Lobo don't talk.
c15370 +++$+++ Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
c08620 +++$+++ You got it wrong, boy. I'm not the monster you think.
c08620 +++$+++ Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
c08620 +++$+++ She was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
c21758 +++$+++ Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
c21758 +++$+++ Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
c21758 +++$+++ I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
c21758 +++$+++ The young lady staying in your room?
c14668 +++$+++ You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
c14668 +++$+++ It works a little.
c14668 +++$+++ No it doesn't. I see right through you.
c14668 +++$+++ You do?
c14668 +++$+++ Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
c20188 +++$+++ Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
c20188 +++$+++ What if I pay the rent?
c20188 +++$+++ Uh-huh?
c14984 +++$+++ You're back.
c14984 +++$+++ Yeah.
c14984 +++$+++ I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
c14984 +++$+++ Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.
c14984 +++$+++ Sure. Why not.
c14984 +++$+++ Where? Where is he?
c14984 +++$+++ Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
c14984 +++$+++ You talk to him?
c14984 +++$+++ Oh, sure... Twice a day.
c14984 +++$+++ What hospital is he in? Where?
c14984 +++$+++ Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
c14984 +++$+++ He doesn't want people bugging him, Nick!
c19560 +++$+++ I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.
c19560 +++$+++ Ready to go,go,go?
c19560 +++$+++ They're here, they're fine. In the dressing room.  See you later --
c19208 +++$+++ You all right back there, mate?
c19208 +++$+++ Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
c19208 +++$+++ It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
c19208 +++$+++ All right, furry muff.
c10900 +++$+++ Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
c10900 +++$+++ It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
c10900 +++$+++ She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
c10900 +++$+++ But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
c10900 +++$+++ She has it now.
c10900 +++$+++ I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
c10900 +++$+++ Not simple, no.
c10900 +++$+++ I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
c10900 +++$+++ It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
c10900 +++$+++ And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
c06621 +++$+++ How's it going? Okay?
c06621 +++$+++ Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
c06621 +++$+++ Gold, eh?
c06621 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c06621 +++$+++ Fourteen carat?
c06621 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c06621 +++$+++ Is that the best you've got?
c06621 +++$+++ Oh, yes sir.
c06621 +++$+++ A smaller bowl of flowers.
c12334 +++$+++ No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
c12334 +++$+++ I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
c12334 +++$+++ Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
c03855 +++$+++ Edith was just telling me about her job.
c03855 +++$+++ I'm a file clerk.
c03855 +++$+++ Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.
c03855 +++$+++ Harrison. Harrison Feed and Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth... I'm in charge of the invoices... And I type up the schedule for the trucking fleet...
c03855 +++$+++ Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
c00968 +++$+++ It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
c00968 +++$+++ Likewise.
c00968 +++$+++ I can explain. They attacked me. Gas came out of her...well, and then they... and I...
c00968 +++$+++ Hold on a tick, let me put on my togs.
c09964 +++$+++ Why don't you help me?
c09964 +++$+++ Because I don't have time.
c09964 +++$+++ Why not?
c09964 +++$+++ I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
c09964 +++$+++ And how do you know that?
c09964 +++$+++ William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
c19145 +++$+++ He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
c19145 +++$+++ Killed outright?
c19145 +++$+++ No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
c19145 +++$+++ You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
c19145 +++$+++ Quid pro quo, Doctor.
c19145 +++$+++ The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
c19145 +++$+++ Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
c19145 +++$+++ Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
c19145 +++$+++ No. Tell me why.
c19145 +++$+++ After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
c19145 +++$+++ I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
c19145 +++$+++ A cattle ranch?
c19145 +++$+++ Horses - and sheep...
c19145 +++$+++ How long did you live there?
c19145 +++$+++ Two months.
c19145 +++$+++ Why so briefly?
c19145 +++$+++ I - ran away...
c19145 +++$+++ Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
c19145 +++$+++ No.
c19145 +++$+++ Did he try to?
c19145 +++$+++ No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.
c19145 +++$+++ Billy's not a real transsexual, but he thinks he is. He tries to be. He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
c19145 +++$+++ You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
c19145 +++$+++ There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
c19145 +++$+++ On what basis would they reject him?
c19145 +++$+++ How would he test?
c27065 +++$+++ Oh, how inappropriate is that!
c27065 +++$+++ Take a whiff of heaven.
c27065 +++$+++ How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
c27065 +++$+++ Give me those!
c13465 +++$+++ So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
c13465 +++$+++ I'll be there.
c13465 +++$+++ Bye.
c08643 +++$+++ Sure thing, killer.
c08643 +++$+++ What can I do you for?
c08643 +++$+++ How many you need?
c01297 +++$+++ This is totally unnecessary --
c01297 +++$+++ He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
c01297 +++$+++ But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
c01297 +++$+++ He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
c01297 +++$+++ Then it's unofficial.
c10939 +++$+++ No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
c10939 +++$+++ Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
c10939 +++$+++ Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
c10939 +++$+++ Is she?
c10939 +++$+++ Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
c10939 +++$+++ Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.
c00177 +++$+++ Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
c00177 +++$+++ There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
c00177 +++$+++ When do we arrive at Clavius?
c00177 +++$+++ Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
c10527 +++$+++ Do you have your ticket?
c10527 +++$+++ Yes.
c10527 +++$+++ Look, I just better go.
c11238 +++$+++ You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
c11238 +++$+++ Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
c11238 +++$+++ You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
c11238 +++$+++ Uh-huh. Good for you.
c17506 +++$+++ Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
c17506 +++$+++ It is. It's lovely.
c17506 +++$+++ We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
c12022 +++$+++ What do you think?
c12022 +++$+++ I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
c12022 +++$+++ It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
c12022 +++$+++ You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
c12022 +++$+++ No, I wanted to make a painting of you.
c09114 +++$+++ My God, what happened here?
c09114 +++$+++ You feign ignorance?
c09114 +++$+++ You crippled our gravitational field with a direst torpedo hit, and two Starfleet crewmen beamed aboard in magnetic boots and did this! WE HAVE WITNESSES!
c10777 +++$+++ Hey, that was... intense.
c10777 +++$+++ You're still here.
c10777 +++$+++ I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
c10777 +++$+++ Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
c10777 +++$+++ Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
c05062 +++$+++ What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street.  Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
c05062 +++$+++ I'm okay. I just don't want to lis- ten.
c05062 +++$+++ You look upset.
c05062 +++$+++ I'm not upset.
c05062 +++$+++ Jake, what is it?
c05062 +++$+++ I'm tired.
c05062 +++$+++ You look terrible. What happened?  Jake ... is it the antidote?
c05062 +++$+++ Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
c05062 +++$+++ Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
c05062 +++$+++ Shit! Can't I just have a bad day?
c05062 +++$+++ You can have anything you want.
c05062 +++$+++ Then don't bug me.
c05062 +++$+++ I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
c05062 +++$+++ Mid-town mostly.
c05062 +++$+++ Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
c05062 +++$+++ I picked up my ticket.  I'm leaving in the morning, Jez.
c05062 +++$+++ Oh?  Where you going?
c05062 +++$+++ West.
c05062 +++$+++ Where's West? New Jersey?
c05062 +++$+++ Don't be funny.
c05062 +++$+++ I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
c05062 +++$+++ Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
c05062 +++$+++ Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
c19987 +++$+++ My wife.
c19987 +++$+++ What's it like?
c19987 +++$+++ That must suck. All... backwards.				 *
c18853 +++$+++ What if the dinosaur comes back while we're all asleep?
c18853 +++$+++ I'll stay awake.
c18853 +++$+++ All night.
c11095 +++$+++ I think I know...
c11095 +++$+++ Something most important you can do.
c11095 +++$+++ You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
c11095 +++$+++ If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
c11095 +++$+++ After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
c11095 +++$+++ It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
c11095 +++$+++ You talk just as Addison said you did.
c11095 +++$+++ I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
c26172 +++$+++ I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
c26172 +++$+++ What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
c26172 +++$+++ Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
c26172 +++$+++ Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.
c14242 +++$+++ Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
c14242 +++$+++ I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
c14242 +++$+++ You said you were visiting friends!
c14242 +++$+++ They're <u>somebody's</u> friends...  You drive a cab.  I kill people.  We both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
c14242 +++$+++ Listen.  I'm not trying to piss you off, see?  Okay?  I can't drive you around so you can murder folks.
c14242 +++$+++ You don't understand.  I mean it. Really.  I'm not up for this...
c09634 +++$+++ Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
c09634 +++$+++ I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
c09634 +++$+++ Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
c09634 +++$+++ Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean.
c07806 +++$+++ Mm. Not a very good picture I am told.
c07806 +++$+++ Uh-hub.
c07806 +++$+++ Yeah
c21991 +++$+++ Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
c21991 +++$+++ Okay.
c21991 +++$+++ Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
c21991 +++$+++ Take a little walk with me, huh?
c19790 +++$+++ Sure...
c19790 +++$+++ What's your name?
c19790 +++$+++ Bob.
c19790 +++$+++ "Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
c19790 +++$+++ Bob Gorsky.
c19790 +++$+++ Yes.
c24372 +++$+++ I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
c24372 +++$+++ Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
c24372 +++$+++ You'll like it here.
c24372 +++$+++ Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
c24372 +++$+++ You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
c24372 +++$+++ I'll take care of that.
c24372 +++$+++ It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
c24372 +++$+++ I'm used to paying my own bills.
c24372 +++$+++ You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
c24372 +++$+++ Okay.  We'll deduct it from my salary.
c24372 +++$+++ Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
c24372 +++$+++ Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
c16349 +++$+++ You... don't have to... leave.
c16349 +++$+++ Whatever.
c16349 +++$+++ Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
c16349 +++$+++ Chloe's dead.
c16349 +++$+++ When?
c16349 +++$+++ Do you care?
c16349 +++$+++ It was the smart move on her part.
c17456 +++$+++ That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
c17456 +++$+++ A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
c17456 +++$+++ Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
c17456 +++$+++ To make a long story short...
c20781 +++$+++ Yeah.
c20781 +++$+++ Where was that?
c20781 +++$+++ Walker and Williams.
c20781 +++$+++ Anderson.
c08719 +++$+++ Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
c08719 +++$+++ No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
c08719 +++$+++ -- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
c09352 +++$+++ Let's talk about Zero.
c09352 +++$+++ [Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
c09352 +++$+++ [Not the heart, the watch.]
c26533 +++$+++ If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
c26533 +++$+++ Well, of course, it's always dangerous ...
c26533 +++$+++ Yes.
c15566 +++$+++ We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned.
c15566 +++$+++ Is she?
c15566 +++$+++ Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
c15566 +++$+++ You lost me, Sid.  Who?
c15566 +++$+++ Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
c15566 +++$+++ I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
c15566 +++$+++ No.  It's felony possession of marijuana.
c04733 +++$+++ Wrigley?
c04733 +++$+++ Miles.
c04733 +++$+++ Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
c04733 +++$+++ Do you have it?
c02755 +++$+++ Were you an alcoholic?
c02755 +++$+++ No.
c02755 +++$+++ No. Never.
c01116 +++$+++ Aren't you even curious?
c01116 +++$+++ Engine 115, right?
c01116 +++$+++ How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
c01116 +++$+++ Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
c01116 +++$+++ You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
c01116 +++$+++ Ah man, if you're gonna bribe your way into a station, why not 17 with me and your brother?
c10351 +++$+++ Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
c10351 +++$+++ What happened to her?
c10351 +++$+++ There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
c10351 +++$+++ Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
c10351 +++$+++ No.
c10351 +++$+++ No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
c23170 +++$+++ Yeah!
c23170 +++$+++ Wash her.
c23170 +++$+++ -- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
c17080 +++$+++ Oh, Christ.
c17080 +++$+++ The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
c17080 +++$+++ You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
c17080 +++$+++ Kenilw...
c15240 +++$+++ Whaddup.  Money?
c15240 +++$+++ I was going to buy a slice.
c15240 +++$+++ On the rebound.
c02120 +++$+++ I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
c02120 +++$+++ Absolutely not.
c02120 +++$+++ I don't gamble.
c02913 +++$+++ They take you away to San Clemente Island.  Half the guys quit when they come back.  Supposed to be just hell-and-a-half.
c02913 +++$+++ That's what I hear.
c02913 +++$+++ Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
c02913 +++$+++ Just some of the women.
c20711 +++$+++ Parts.
c20711 +++$+++ Do you carry door handles?
c20711 +++$+++ What kind?
c20711 +++$+++ Nash.
c20711 +++$+++ Sixty-three.
c24648 +++$+++ You told me you'd break up that romance - when?
c24648 +++$+++ You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
c24648 +++$+++ Why not break it up yourself?  You could do it in two minutes flat.
c02725 +++$+++ My husband...
c02725 +++$+++ Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
c02725 +++$+++ What?
c00903 +++$+++ ...wanna savor this.
c00903 +++$+++ It's gonna get cold.
c00903 +++$+++ You're just afraid to eat it.
c12747 +++$+++ Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything from the beginning, and then we'll let you go. Name ...
c12747 +++$+++ Sid Ahmed.
c12747 +++$+++ Second name.
c12747 +++$+++ Sail.
c12747 +++$+++ Which "district" do you belong to?
c12747 +++$+++ Second district ...
c12747 +++$+++ Second district ... Explain better ...
c12747 +++$+++ Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
c12747 +++$+++ What "group"?
c12747 +++$+++ Third group.
c12747 +++$+++ Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
c20869 +++$+++ I'll show you how to tell what's going on. If things go south, you unplug me.
c20869 +++$+++ What is it with you? Why is it so important? It's a buzz, right? Like getting high.
c20869 +++$+++ So you're a wire junkie.
c04246 +++$+++ What did he say?
c04246 +++$+++ He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
c04246 +++$+++ Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
c23001 +++$+++ Is it going well?
c23001 +++$+++ Very well.
c23001 +++$+++ Yes, but very well.
c25162 +++$+++ Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
c25162 +++$+++ Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
c25162 +++$+++ I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
c25162 +++$+++ JTS...?
c25162 +++$+++ What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
c25162 +++$+++ I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
c25162 +++$+++ No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private.
c14564 +++$+++ Mr. Zammito?
c14564 +++$+++ Uh huh.
c14564 +++$+++ I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
c14564 +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
c14564 +++$+++ I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
c14564 +++$+++ You see that car?
c14944 +++$+++ What is it then?
c14944 +++$+++ I... I just don't want to come.
c14944 +++$+++ But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
c14944 +++$+++ Yes.  But
c14944 +++$+++ Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
c14944 +++$+++ I don't want to read.
c14944 +++$+++ What?
c14944 +++$+++ God, you really have a problem, don't you?  How can it hurt you to read?  I mean isn't that what this is all about? Expressing yourself?
c07019 +++$+++ Is this the wish of the masses?
c07019 +++$+++ It is their wish.
c07019 +++$+++ Please.
c20093 +++$+++ Ever stationed at Kennedy? Those Florida chicks...
c20093 +++$+++ Instant V-goddam-D.
c20093 +++$+++ This Pensacola teeny-bopper -- jail bait -- but built? Ten bucks she wanted. Three of us made a deal for, twenty-five, see, big goddam bargain?
c20093 +++$+++ Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
c20093 +++$+++ No. You got it.
c04725 +++$+++ Time marches on. Ardor cools.
c04725 +++$+++ No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
c04725 +++$+++ Ah.
c04725 +++$+++ You know what I mean when I say "it."
c04725 +++$+++ Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
c04725 +++$+++ Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
c04725 +++$+++ Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
c04725 +++$+++ I don't know. I can assume...
c04725 +++$+++ Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
c04725 +++$+++ I'm not sure.
c04725 +++$+++ And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
c04725 +++$+++ Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
c01172 +++$+++ What do you want?
c01172 +++$+++ I want to speak with you.
c01172 +++$+++ It's me, Peerless.
c20240 +++$+++ Reach your folks?  How they feeling?
c20240 +++$+++ About what?
c20240 +++$+++ Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
c16570 +++$+++ Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch?
c16570 +++$+++ Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probably explains the curious feeling of love I have for you.
c16570 +++$+++ For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
c16570 +++$+++ We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?
c11676 +++$+++ Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
c11676 +++$+++ Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
c11676 +++$+++ There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
c11676 +++$+++ Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
c11676 +++$+++ Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
c11676 +++$+++ Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
c00057 +++$+++ My insurance does not cover PMS
c00057 +++$+++ Then tell them I had a seizure.
c00057 +++$+++ Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
c00057 +++$+++ I thought you were punishing me.
c00057 +++$+++ Why can't we agree on this?
c00057 +++$+++ Because you're making decisions for me.
c00057 +++$+++ As a parent, that's my right
c00057 +++$+++ So what I want doesn't matter?
c00057 +++$+++ I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
c17623 +++$+++ I am. Ben Meeker.
c17623 +++$+++ Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
c17623 +++$+++ Loomis. Folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. At least not cops. So what brings you back here after 10 years?
c17623 +++$+++ Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
c17623 +++$+++ That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
c17623 +++$+++ He's here, Sheriff.
c17623 +++$+++ Why?
c17623 +++$+++ 10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
c17623 +++$+++ Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
c17623 +++$+++ Myers has been locked up since before she was born. He's never laid eyes on her.
c01353 +++$+++ Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
c01353 +++$+++ It's makes it easier. Okay.
c01353 +++$+++ I don't want to know.
c01353 +++$+++ That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
c01198 +++$+++ How did you get this gig?
c01198 +++$+++ My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
c01198 +++$+++ This is a TV show, not a music video.
c01198 +++$+++ This is a travesty.  A debacle.
c11008 +++$+++ Seal everything now!
c11008 +++$+++ What's happening?
c11008 +++$+++ We're what!?
c02944 +++$+++ So why're you even considering it? Are you?
c02944 +++$+++ Just like you would be.
c02944 +++$+++ I take it you don't either.  Feet.
c10391 +++$+++ Why did he go to see Mary Rooney?
c10391 +++$+++ She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
c10391 +++$+++ What did he find?
c10391 +++$+++ Nothing.
c10391 +++$+++ How good's your intelligence?
c10391 +++$+++ Very good.
c10391 +++$+++ As far as we know, nothing.
c19707 +++$+++ Is it weird?
c19707 +++$+++ The mark? Yes.
c19707 +++$+++ Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
c17077 +++$+++ Eight units?
c17077 +++$+++ That's right.
c17077 +++$+++ Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
c23223 +++$+++ Five times a day?
c23223 +++$+++ -- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
c23223 +++$+++ Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
c23223 +++$+++ Well, you know what I mean.
c23223 +++$+++ After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
c23223 +++$+++ I'm exaggerating.
c23223 +++$+++ How much?
c23223 +++$+++ Jackie --
c23223 +++$+++ What?
c23223 +++$+++ Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
c23223 +++$+++ He does?
c23223 +++$+++ Well yes -- you know that about George.
c23223 +++$+++ It's been so long I don't how long?
c23223 +++$+++ Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
c23223 +++$+++ I would say so, yes.
c23223 +++$+++ Honey?
c23223 +++$+++ I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
c15416 +++$+++ You know who we are?
c15416 +++$+++ Tell me.
c15416 +++$+++ We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
c15416 +++$+++ I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
c15416 +++$+++ I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
c15416 +++$+++ Your brother's here.
c06802 +++$+++ Then, you have my thanks, Captain Charles, for safely escorting Madame Bonaparte to Milan, and you may consider your assignment completed.
c06802 +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
c06802 +++$+++ You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
c06802 +++$+++ You may go, Captain Charles.
c12863 +++$+++ What?
c12863 +++$+++ She starts sniffing me.
c12863 +++$+++ Oh my God...  You're blushing.
c12863 +++$+++ It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
c12863 +++$+++ Then what happened?
c12863 +++$+++ Oh you!
c09244 +++$+++ Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
c09244 +++$+++ Hey, fuck you, man.
c09244 +++$+++ Yeah, right.
c21395 +++$+++ What happened to you?
c21395 +++$+++ I had a dream that Grandma died.
c21395 +++$+++ Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
c21395 +++$+++ She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
c21395 +++$+++ Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
c21395 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
c21395 +++$+++ I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
c23095 +++$+++ Two?
c23095 +++$+++ Who said there were four?
c23095 +++$+++ We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
c23095 +++$+++ No, three. Who said there were four?
c23095 +++$+++ How strange. And how unsatisfactory to have misleading information. Only three people here. You're sure?
c23095 +++$+++ Take a note of that, Mitchell. Only three, rather than four. Write it down. You can use numbers or words, I have no preference. Which are you using?
c12849 +++$+++ He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
c12849 +++$+++ Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
c12849 +++$+++ I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
c18572 +++$+++ You're not going out right away, are you?
c18572 +++$+++ Waiting for Andy.
c18572 +++$+++ I will, I will.
c00199 +++$+++ I'll tell you what happens if you lose... you tell the truth for once.
c00199 +++$+++ What are you talkin' about?
c00199 +++$+++ You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
c00199 +++$+++ The bet's off.
c00143 +++$+++ So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
c00143 +++$+++ That's what it looks like to me.
c00143 +++$+++ Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
c26904 +++$+++ Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
c26904 +++$+++ Excuse me.
c26904 +++$+++ Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
c26904 +++$+++ Oh yes, I remember you.
c26904 +++$+++ Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
c26904 +++$+++ Stock broker. As in: never have so few done so little for so much. So what do you see in this?
c11505 +++$+++ You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?
c11505 +++$+++ I'm not very good at it.
c11505 +++$+++ You don't have to entertain me.
c11840 +++$+++ You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
c11840 +++$+++ -- This play means a lot to me.
c11840 +++$+++ -- I know you don't suck at acting.
c25924 +++$+++ Ah, you young folks don't know how it is. How is Gideon today?
c25924 +++$+++ He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
c25924 +++$+++ I hope that it's nothing serious.
c25924 +++$+++ Let me earn my keep. I'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot. Try to make him some cow tea next time.
c05517 +++$+++ Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
c05517 +++$+++ How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
c05517 +++$+++ I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
c05517 +++$+++ So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
c05517 +++$+++ East coast people are different.
c05517 +++$+++ Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
c05517 +++$+++ I'm seriously in love with you -- Isn't that enough?
c01100 +++$+++ Hi.
c01100 +++$+++ Hi.
c01100 +++$+++ We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
c01100 +++$+++ Swayzak knows something about the guys that were murdered. I want to know why he keeps that hidden.
c01100 +++$+++ I don't know anything about it.
c01100 +++$+++ You could check. It'd be in his files.
c01100 +++$+++ Do you know what you're asking me to do?
c01100 +++$+++ Yes.
c01100 +++$+++ Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
c01582 +++$+++ If we still have one.
c01582 +++$+++ Yes...
c01582 +++$+++ You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
c01582 +++$+++ Sure.
c11914 +++$+++ Hi.
c11914 +++$+++ Yes?
c11914 +++$+++ Yes.
c11982 +++$+++ How long were you having sex with him?
c11982 +++$+++ About a year and a half.
c11982 +++$+++ Were you with him last night?
c11982 +++$+++ Yes.
c11982 +++$+++ Did you leave the club with him?
c11982 +++$+++ Yes.
c11982 +++$+++ Did you go home with him?
c11982 +++$+++ No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
c11982 +++$+++ No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
c01678 +++$+++ Now, you will receive us.
c01678 +++$+++ We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
c01678 +++$+++ We do not want your tired and sick.
c01678 +++$+++ It is your corrupt we claim.
c01678 +++$+++ It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
c01678 +++$+++ With every breath we shall hunt them down.
c01678 +++$+++ Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
c01678 +++$+++ Do not kill, do not rape, do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace.
c01678 +++$+++ These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost.
c01678 +++$+++ There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
c01678 +++$+++ And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
c19539 +++$+++ Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
c19539 +++$+++ It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
c19539 +++$+++ Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
c19539 +++$+++ I'm really only equipped to take orders --
c19539 +++$+++ Well can you connect me to someone else?
c19539 +++$+++ Well what's the situation?
c19539 +++$+++ Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?
c19539 +++$+++ OK.  See:  Frank TJ Macky is Earl Partridge's son....
c20978 +++$+++ I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
c20978 +++$+++ No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
c20978 +++$+++ I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
c20978 +++$+++ Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
c20978 +++$+++ Oh no no -- no.
c09849 +++$+++ We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.
c09849 +++$+++ What about Mom?
c09849 +++$+++ No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
c09849 +++$+++ Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
c18615 +++$+++ Go where?
c18615 +++$+++ On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
c18615 +++$+++ Nobody told me.
c18615 +++$+++ I just did.  Can you make them do tricks?
c18615 +++$+++ They're not tricks.  They're behavior patterns.
c18615 +++$+++ Fine.  Have them do some.
c18615 +++$+++ Yes, aren't we all.
c13584 +++$+++ Who am I talking to?
c13584 +++$+++ Call me "Nels."
c13584 +++$+++ Okay Nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  I'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
c13584 +++$+++ I think I've already had a "quickie."  Thank you.
c22075 +++$+++ Why do I always have to sit in back?
c22075 +++$+++ It's just the way things are, kiddo.
c22075 +++$+++ It's not gonna happen.
c03944 +++$+++ No time for argument.
c03944 +++$+++ You did this before, right?
c03944 +++$+++ To a man called Frank Cotton?
c17169 +++$+++ What's that mean?
c17169 +++$+++ It means it's too cold to go swimming.  And I don't mean the water.
c17169 +++$+++ Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
c08169 +++$+++ Where the hell are we?
c08169 +++$+++ It looks like the furnace.
c08169 +++$+++ Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
c10636 +++$+++ You snore.
c10636 +++$+++ So I hear.
c10636 +++$+++ He's right, you look horrible.
c16490 +++$+++ ..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
c16490 +++$+++ Who are you talking to Jack?
c16490 +++$+++ Bingo!
c16100 +++$+++ Ah, you know. Howsa pooch?
c16100 +++$+++ Losing his teeth.
c16100 +++$+++ Yeah.  Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
c06024 +++$+++ Why isn't Ruiz coming?
c06024 +++$+++ This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
c06024 +++$+++ What's that?
c06024 +++$+++ Yeah.
c11600 +++$+++ What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down?
c11600 +++$+++ Who knows what's up there?
c11600 +++$+++ I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse.
c25395 +++$+++ My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
c25395 +++$+++ I don't think so.
c25395 +++$+++ Are you going to leave me too?
c25395 +++$+++ Are you sent by God?
c11883 +++$+++ Say, where did this guitar come from?
c11883 +++$+++ Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
c11883 +++$+++ I don't recall ever seeing it before.
c11883 +++$+++ Curious... Very curious....
c17001 +++$+++ Jack! I didn't like that.
c17001 +++$+++ You should have told me who you were working for.
c17001 +++$+++ Cyril didn't like it, either.
c17001 +++$+++ He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in.
c10312 +++$+++ You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
c10312 +++$+++ ...For ten years, now.
c10312 +++$+++ -- Me? Neither.
c09943 +++$+++ I need to get this letter to someone.
c09943 +++$+++ I can't take you out of here in your condition...
c09943 +++$+++ And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
c09943 +++$+++ Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs.
c27336 +++$+++ Most guys we ran through this either took off or helped them rob the place. I expected you to do the same.
c27336 +++$+++ That shows me already that you don't have a clue. What's it to you, anyway?
c27336 +++$+++ Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
c27336 +++$+++ Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
c27336 +++$+++ It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
c27336 +++$+++ A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
c27336 +++$+++ Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
c27336 +++$+++ ..If you're trolling around for narcs, man, have you got the wrong guy.
c27336 +++$+++ Why is that?
c27336 +++$+++ Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
c27336 +++$+++ Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
c27336 +++$+++ Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
c27336 +++$+++ You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
c27336 +++$+++ Is that a fact?
c27336 +++$+++ Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
c27336 +++$+++ You know what I hate? It's always the assholes that pass the tests.
c19596 +++$+++ What? What? What now?
c19596 +++$+++ Quietly, slow down, whoa --
c19596 +++$+++ You can't just come in here.
c19596 +++$+++ The door was open, I got a call --
c19596 +++$+++ You're just come in --
c19596 +++$+++ Calm down.
c19596 +++$+++ I am calm.
c19596 +++$+++ I got a call to this apartment, report of a disturbance --
c19596 +++$+++ There's no disturbance.
c19596 +++$+++ I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
c19596 +++$+++ There's no disturbance.
c19596 +++$+++ Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
c19596 +++$+++ You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
c19596 +++$+++ Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
c19596 +++$+++ I AM CALM.
c19596 +++$+++ You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
c19596 +++$+++ I don't have to answer your questions.
c19596 +++$+++ No you don't: But I'm gonna ask you one more time: Are you alone in here?
c19596 +++$+++ What does it look like?
c19596 +++$+++ No one else in here?
c19596 +++$+++ You're here.
c19596 +++$+++ OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
c19596 +++$+++ No.  I said that.
c19596 +++$+++ Are you lyin' to me?
c19596 +++$+++ I live alone.
c19596 +++$+++ Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
c19596 +++$+++ No I Said.
c19596 +++$+++ Ok. What's your name?
c19596 +++$+++ Marcie.
c19596 +++$+++ Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
c19596 +++$+++ I'm not askin', Marcie.
c24587 +++$+++ I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
c24587 +++$+++ That would complicate things.
c24587 +++$+++ Because I'd be to blame, right?
c24587 +++$+++ Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
c24587 +++$+++ He knows that?  Billy?
c24587 +++$+++ Billy said that?
c05635 +++$+++ Are you talking?
c05635 +++$+++ I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
c05635 +++$+++ Sun glasses?
c05635 +++$+++ To hide a black eye.
c05635 +++$+++ Why wouldn't she leave?
c05635 +++$+++ I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
c05635 +++$+++ I would have killed him.
c05635 +++$+++ Do you ever wish you had done it?
c00285 +++$+++ Files are mostly by state and year of disappearance.  We try to keep the children and adults separate. No eating or smoking in here, but there's a coffee machine in the hall.
c00285 +++$+++ Any good?
c00285 +++$+++ It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
c00285 +++$+++ It's good what you're doing.
c10876 +++$+++ Who?
c10876 +++$+++ Go away, I don't want you here.
c10876 +++$+++ No... don't hit me please...
c09241 +++$+++ Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
c09241 +++$+++ I wouldn't think so.
c09241 +++$+++ We will.  Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
c14484 +++$+++ Don't take it personally.
c14484 +++$+++ You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
c14484 +++$+++ I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
c27297 +++$+++ Where's the sub going?!
c27297 +++$+++ No!  Get me out!
c27297 +++$+++ This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
c27213 +++$+++ Does anybody know I'm here?
c27213 +++$+++ Only the elders.
c27213 +++$+++ How long?
c27213 +++$+++ What?
c27213 +++$+++ How long have I been here?
c27213 +++$+++ Two days.
c27213 +++$+++ But you can't.
c17490 +++$+++ Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
c17490 +++$+++ I think I'll go see Debi today.
c17490 +++$+++ Of course you will.
c17490 +++$+++ I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
c17490 +++$+++ Take care of her. She's a keeper.
c17490 +++$+++ Yeah...
c17490 +++$+++ I have always thought about her and missed her.
c06785 +++$+++ Oh, Mother, I'm sorry. I know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who I am!
c06785 +++$+++ But... the silverware?
c06785 +++$+++ I use it... to fight evil.
c06785 +++$+++ Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
c06785 +++$+++ It is?
c06785 +++$+++ I always knew that you were special.
c06785 +++$+++ Ever since you were a little boy...  Come with me.
c11253 +++$+++ Yeah. I guess so.  Did he say anything? Before the coma?
c11253 +++$+++ Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
c11253 +++$+++ Why would he pick this one?
c11253 +++$+++ I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
c11253 +++$+++ Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
c11109 +++$+++ Lloyd, what happened...?
c11109 +++$+++ Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
c11109 +++$+++ Margo, again...
c11109 +++$+++ And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
c11109 +++$+++ That's on time for Margo.
c11109 +++$+++ Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
c11109 +++$+++ It's just possible she didn't...
c11109 +++$+++ Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
c11109 +++$+++ - don't run out of adjectives, dear.
c11109 +++$+++ - everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
c11109 +++$+++ Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
c16380 +++$+++ No thanks, I quit.
c16380 +++$+++ You quit?
c16380 +++$+++ Work.  Going to work.
c06414 +++$+++ We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
c06414 +++$+++ Try harder.
c06414 +++$+++ There was no need to kill her.
c06414 +++$+++ Come on Tanner, think this through.
c06651 +++$+++ Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
c06651 +++$+++ What about it, Mr. Deeds?
c06651 +++$+++ Why, I turned them down, naturally.
c06651 +++$+++ Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
c04544 +++$+++ Now what?
c04544 +++$+++ The beach.
c04544 +++$+++ The beach?
c04544 +++$+++ How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
c04544 +++$+++ Just get there.
c22617 +++$+++ : What are you up to?
c22617 +++$+++ Nothing.
c22617 +++$+++ What do you want from me, Colette?
c22617 +++$+++ I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
c22617 +++$+++ You really need to lighten up.
c22371 +++$+++ Invitation, please.
c22371 +++$+++ I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
c22371 +++$+++ I got held up at a wedding in Tai Koo. Ricky here yet, I need to get his requests.
c13424 +++$+++ Get - Get up! Get up!
c13424 +++$+++ I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
c13424 +++$+++ Get - get up!
c13424 +++$+++ Get up! Get going!  Get up!
c18014 +++$+++ I'm leaving.
c18014 +++$+++ Leaving what?
c18014 +++$+++ England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
c18014 +++$+++ And what do you think you will find in another land?
c18014 +++$+++ Then it's worth the journey.
c23458 +++$+++ So. Are we ready?
c23458 +++$+++ Ready. Any time you are.
c23458 +++$+++ I'm all ears.
c23458 +++$+++ Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
c23458 +++$+++ Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
c20964 +++$+++ God, that's an enormous arse.
c20964 +++$+++ I'm not listening.
c20964 +++$+++ I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
c26938 +++$+++ What?
c26938 +++$+++ Try to communicate with her somehow.
c26938 +++$+++ Can't hurt.  And I think it's important you find out what she wants.
c02847 +++$+++ Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
c02847 +++$+++ I've been preoccupied.
c02847 +++$+++ We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
c02847 +++$+++ That is my concern.  I'm involved in something just now. I want to finish it in Waldman's memory.
c02847 +++$+++ Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
c12620 +++$+++ Where are we going, Frank?
c12620 +++$+++ Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
c12620 +++$+++ Frank?
c12620 +++$+++ You want to see him too, right?
c12620 +++$+++ Then, shut up!
c02507 +++$+++ What took you so long?
c02507 +++$+++ I just walked in.
c02507 +++$+++ Hmmm. Do you miss me?
c02507 +++$+++ Oddly enough, I do.
c02507 +++$+++ Ha Ha! You said, I do. I guess that means we're married.
c02507 +++$+++ Tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
c06194 +++$+++ How are you getting along with Pinta?
c06194 +++$+++ We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
c06194 +++$+++ Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
c06194 +++$+++ No.
c06194 +++$+++ You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
c13213 +++$+++ What the hell's going on?
c13213 +++$+++ Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
c13213 +++$+++ He made a cat.
c00237 +++$+++ Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
c00237 +++$+++ I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
c00237 +++$+++ I know. I was there when she arrived.
c19559 +++$+++ Diet Coke.
c19559 +++$+++ I want a shot of tequila too.
c19559 +++$+++ It doesn't matter.
c08941 +++$+++ ... He spoke of your friendship.
c08941 +++$+++ Yes...
c08941 +++$+++ He asked you not to grieve...
c08941 +++$+++ ... Yes...
c08941 +++$+++ ... The needs of the many outweigh...
c08941 +++$+++ ... The needs of the few...
c08941 +++$+++ ... Or the one.
c08941 +++$+++ ... Spock...
c08941 +++$+++ I have been... and always shall be... your friend. Live long... and prosper!
c08941 +++$+++ ... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
c08941 +++$+++ Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
c08941 +++$+++ I see... and I understand.  Then everything that he was... Everything that he knew... is lost. And when I return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
c01233 +++$+++ I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
c01233 +++$+++ Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
c01233 +++$+++ Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
c01233 +++$+++ Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
c01233 +++$+++ Then you yield to me.
c01233 +++$+++ On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
c01233 +++$+++ Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
c01233 +++$+++ Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
c21729 +++$+++ My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
c21729 +++$+++ Why?
c21729 +++$+++ You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
c21729 +++$+++ You mean they don't have hookers.
c21729 +++$+++ Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
c21729 +++$+++ Exactly.
c10554 +++$+++ I can dig this music... But not that singer.
c10554 +++$+++ Why? He's right in the groove.
c10554 +++$+++ He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
c10554 +++$+++ Yeah, well, if he says that all that flab turns into dick at midnight, he's a liar.
c04758 +++$+++ Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
c04758 +++$+++ Any others?
c04758 +++$+++ Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
c04758 +++$+++ What do they say?
c04758 +++$+++ They're practically all the same, sir.
c04758 +++$+++ They're the finest detective agency in the country, sir.
c14266 +++$+++ I don't see the connection.
c14266 +++$+++ Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
c14266 +++$+++ Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
c09925 +++$+++ Oh, very different.  But not entirely... I mean we have lots of, um, trees and such.  But not everywhere.  And more roads.  And buildings.
c09925 +++$+++ Why?
c09925 +++$+++ To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
c09925 +++$+++ Yes.  I hope you won't take this the wrong way but is there someone older I could talk to?  An elder or patriarch of some kind?
c11737 +++$+++ You should knock.
c11737 +++$+++ Sorry.
c11737 +++$+++ The beach?  It was nice.
c14734 +++$+++ You?
c14734 +++$+++ Yes, Amy.
c14734 +++$+++ Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
c16912 +++$+++ A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
c16912 +++$+++ I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
c16912 +++$+++ What do you add up to here?
c16912 +++$+++ One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
c16912 +++$+++ A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
c16912 +++$+++ So we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
c16912 +++$+++ The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
c16912 +++$+++ No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
c16912 +++$+++ I bet.
c20833 +++$+++ How long's it been?
c20833 +++$+++ I'm still on my honeymoon.
c20833 +++$+++ So don't pull this cowboy shit now. You'll give him a target.  You'll get yourself killed.  Just keep talking.
c20833 +++$+++ Negotiator entering Kill Zone.
c18161 +++$+++ Moses, Moses Seradungu.
c18161 +++$+++ Can I help you?
c18161 +++$+++ I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
c18161 +++$+++ What is his room number?
c18161 +++$+++ Go downstairs, I will help you.
c21511 +++$+++ Then let's not name the Thanksgiving turkey, okay? I assume you still got a shiv.
c21511 +++$+++ What, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
c21511 +++$+++ Oh, you're a piece of art, Johns. They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
c21615 +++$+++ Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
c21615 +++$+++ Mr. Mitchell.
c21615 +++$+++ A little something on account perhaps?
c21615 +++$+++ I'm afraid this is all for the moment.
c22837 +++$+++ What do you know about trilogies?
c22837 +++$+++ You mean like, movie trilogies?
c22837 +++$+++ You seem to like movies, Detective.
c22837 +++$+++ Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
c22837 +++$+++ I'll call you Mark when you catch the killer, Detective.
c22837 +++$+++ All I know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.
c22837 +++$+++ Did you request this case?
c22837 +++$+++ No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
c22837 +++$+++ Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
c22837 +++$+++ To me Hollywood is about death.
c22837 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c22837 +++$+++ I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
c22837 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c22837 +++$+++ I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
c22837 +++$+++ Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
c22837 +++$+++ Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
c22837 +++$+++ Hmm.
c22837 +++$+++ What did you know about your mother?
c22837 +++$+++ I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
c22837 +++$+++ Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
c22837 +++$+++ How is that good news?
c22837 +++$+++ Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
c22837 +++$+++ Catch him, or kill him.
c14666 +++$+++ Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
c14666 +++$+++ I know.
c14666 +++$+++ I know.
c26283 +++$+++ What was that all about?
c26283 +++$+++ You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
c26283 +++$+++ You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off. Still want that beer?
c21003 +++$+++ Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
c21003 +++$+++ Blimey.  What's that?
c21003 +++$+++ The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
c21003 +++$+++ It is great, isn't it.  See you tonight. Hey, Marty-- sexy cardy.
c14057 +++$+++ Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.
c14057 +++$+++ If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
c14057 +++$+++ So?
c14057 +++$+++ So? So nobody's going to want to pay for these Gatorades.
c14057 +++$+++ What do you care? Hey, what smells like shoe polish?
c14057 +++$+++ What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
c24931 +++$+++ ...You're Ed Crane?
c24931 +++$+++ Yeah--
c24931 +++$+++ No thanks, I--
c13277 +++$+++ Not a pressing issue.
c13277 +++$+++ I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
c13277 +++$+++ Uh... gym.
c13277 +++$+++ Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
c13277 +++$+++ Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
c13277 +++$+++ But you enjoyed it, yes?
c13277 +++$+++ Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
c13277 +++$+++ Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
c13277 +++$+++ Sporting events, yeah.
c13277 +++$+++ All right.  Why don't you show me a cheer?
c13277 +++$+++ Here?
c13277 +++$+++ Okay.
c15212 +++$+++ Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
c15212 +++$+++ I just come home to take a quick shower.
c15212 +++$+++ Sal's gonna be mad.
c15212 +++$+++ Later for Sal.  Y'know, sometimes I think you're more concerned with him than me.
c15212 +++$+++ I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
c15212 +++$+++ Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
c15212 +++$+++ I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
c15212 +++$+++ Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
c15212 +++$+++ Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
c15212 +++$+++ I didn't stutter.  Take care of your responsibilities.  Y'know exactly what I'm talking about.
c25950 +++$+++ According to my nava-computer, the --
c25950 +++$+++ Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
c25950 +++$+++ Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
c25950 +++$+++ This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
c25950 +++$+++ My fault?!  If you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
c25950 +++$+++ Oh, yeah?  Well, if YOU hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
c25950 +++$+++ WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
c13829 +++$+++ Oh, fuck!
c13829 +++$+++ Forty-five seven!
c13829 +++$+++ Okay.
c26714 +++$+++ Did you send in all of the deposit checks?
c26714 +++$+++ I think so.
c26714 +++$+++ What do you mean, you think so?
c26714 +++$+++ I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure what all of them are.
c26714 +++$+++ The wedding cake check?
c26714 +++$+++ Sent it.
c26714 +++$+++ Photographer?
c26714 +++$+++ Sent it.
c26714 +++$+++ Florist?
c26714 +++$+++ Yup.
c26714 +++$+++ Caterer?
c26714 +++$+++ Yes.
c26714 +++$+++ Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
c26714 +++$+++ I think I forgot the tent.
c26714 +++$+++ You forgot the tent?
c26714 +++$+++ I think so.
c26714 +++$+++ Why?
c26714 +++$+++ Why what?
c26714 +++$+++ Why did you forget the tent check?
c26714 +++$+++ I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
c26714 +++$+++ You can't play around with these tent people.
c26714 +++$+++ I'm not playing around. I forgot.
c26714 +++$+++ What else have you forgot?
c26714 +++$+++ How could I know what else I forgot?
c26714 +++$+++ I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
c26714 +++$+++ Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
c26714 +++$+++ Don't you dare.
c26714 +++$+++ Don't you put this on me. Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...
c21475 +++$+++ I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
c21475 +++$+++ ... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
c21475 +++$+++ ... It's time to get this society back on track!
c00297 +++$+++ You're making me very angry.
c00297 +++$+++ Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
c00297 +++$+++ I'm asking.
c22754 +++$+++ Oskar - my friend Lena.
c22754 +++$+++ How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
c22754 +++$+++ Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
c22754 +++$+++ Things worked out.  I made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. It was good.
c22754 +++$+++ Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
c25439 +++$+++ Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
c25439 +++$+++ I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
c25439 +++$+++ Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see who's in town.
c05661 +++$+++ I can't go right now.
c05661 +++$+++ You can't go because of Sam?
c05661 +++$+++ We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
c05661 +++$+++ You can't go with me because of Sam?
c05661 +++$+++ So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
c02016 +++$+++ I know.
c02016 +++$+++ He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
c02016 +++$+++ Where's Mandalay?
c02016 +++$+++ Burma!
c02016 +++$+++ Oh...
c02016 +++$+++ I understand.
c15945 +++$+++ Excuse me Miss?
c15945 +++$+++ What!
c15945 +++$+++ What man?
c06613 +++$+++ How'd you get the picture?
c06613 +++$+++ Had the boys follow us.
c06613 +++$+++ Marvelous!  "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  Beautiful! What happened after that?
c06613 +++$+++ I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
c06613 +++$+++ Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
c02180 +++$+++ Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.
c02180 +++$+++ Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
c02180 +++$+++ What?
c02180 +++$+++ What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
c23994 +++$+++ What am I gonna do?
c23994 +++$+++ You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
c23994 +++$+++ I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
c23994 +++$+++ But that's what happened.
c23994 +++$+++ But it'll stop the movie.
c23994 +++$+++ Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
c23994 +++$+++ They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
c23994 +++$+++ Carla was in the car, right?
c23994 +++$+++ ...you think that's right...
c16662 +++$+++ How's it going?
c16662 +++$+++ You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
c16662 +++$+++ The point?
c16662 +++$+++ Anyway you want it, asshole.
c13435 +++$+++ The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
c13435 +++$+++ I really think you're -
c13435 +++$+++ You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
c13435 +++$+++ I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
c13435 +++$+++ Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
c13435 +++$+++ I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin'  I'm firin' you, you -
c15368 +++$+++ And PERFECT.  CUT!
c15368 +++$+++ "Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
c15368 +++$+++ I like to think so.
c15368 +++$+++ That cardboard headstone tipped over. This graveyard is obviously phony!
c15368 +++$+++ Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
c14621 +++$+++ Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
c14621 +++$+++ Go away.
c14621 +++$+++ You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
c14621 +++$+++ Maybe I was wrong about you.
c06983 +++$+++ And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
c06983 +++$+++ Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
c06983 +++$+++ And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
c17152 +++$+++ Are you Klingman?
c17152 +++$+++ Who's asking?
c17152 +++$+++ Where can we talk?
c17152 +++$+++ Right here.
c17152 +++$+++ I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
c17152 +++$+++ Who do you think you're talking to?
c17152 +++$+++ You said you were Klingman.
c17152 +++$+++ You don't come in here, talk to an owner in Las Vegas like that.
c17152 +++$+++ Get out of my hotel.
c02354 +++$+++ Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
c02354 +++$+++ All right -- I'll go out and find one.
c02354 +++$+++ Firefly must be captured at any cost.
c02354 +++$+++ That's easy, I'll get him for you wholesale.
c02354 +++$+++ I can't do it right away.
c23699 +++$+++ Wow, a lot of people showed up.
c23699 +++$+++ Yeah, so what do we say?
c23699 +++$+++ Me?!
c07918 +++$+++ Keep your mind off her.
c07918 +++$+++ She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
c07918 +++$+++ And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
c07918 +++$+++ Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
c07918 +++$+++ Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
c07918 +++$+++ And some man will lose his.
c07918 +++$+++ Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
c07918 +++$+++ Well, the salesman could be available soon.
c07918 +++$+++ He and his wife splitting up?
c07918 +++$+++ It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
c07918 +++$+++ Isn't he a salesman?
c07918 +++$+++ Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
c07918 +++$+++ He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
c06176 +++$+++ What are you doing here?
c06176 +++$+++ I came to visit you.
c06176 +++$+++ Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
c06176 +++$+++ A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
c06176 +++$+++ Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
c06176 +++$+++ Take a job, Creasy. Breathe some air. Then decide if you want to... stick around or not.
c02262 +++$+++ DARKO CHEATS DEATH! Man... you're famous! I called you, like, a jillion times last night!
c02262 +++$+++ We went to a hotel.
c02262 +++$+++ I don't wanna talk about it.
c26253 +++$+++ This part isn't about the virus, is it?
c26253 +++$+++ Hey, man...
c26253 +++$+++ It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
c26253 +++$+++ Who am I supposed to shoot?
c08360 +++$+++ Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
c08360 +++$+++ He was a President.
c08360 +++$+++ President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
c08360 +++$+++ Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
c01511 +++$+++ Wait!  Wait!
c01511 +++$+++ What is it?!
c01511 +++$+++ It's Perry!
c01511 +++$+++ Perry?
c01511 +++$+++ Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
c24735 +++$+++ Dr. Furtwangler is a great musician. He actively opposed the Nazis and later on he helped many Jews to escape.
c24735 +++$+++ Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
c24735 +++$+++ It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwangler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
c24735 +++$+++ He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
c24735 +++$+++ Yes, that's true, but he refused to give the Nazi salute. He kept his baton in his right hand. In Hitler's presence. That was a brave act...
c24735 +++$+++ Brave?  To celebrate Hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute? Bravo.
c24735 +++$+++ Do you really think it was brave? Didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?
c21751 +++$+++ You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
c21751 +++$+++ Where are you taking me!?
c21751 +++$+++ To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
c21751 +++$+++ The opera.
c22185 +++$+++ Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
c22185 +++$+++ It ain't your locker no more.
c22185 +++$+++ Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
c15342 +++$+++ Wow.
c15342 +++$+++ And who may you be?
c15342 +++$+++ Edward Wood, Sir.
c15342 +++$+++ Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
c15342 +++$+++ I'm Criswell.  I know all.
c08685 +++$+++ C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
c08685 +++$+++ No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
c08685 +++$+++ Is your security team armed?
c08685 +++$+++ And who has access to that floor?
c13535 +++$+++ That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
c13535 +++$+++ Bullshit.
c13535 +++$+++ Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
c05403 +++$+++ What's that man's name?
c05403 +++$+++ Why do you want to know?
c05403 +++$+++ Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
c16086 +++$+++ No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
c16086 +++$+++ Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
c16086 +++$+++ Forget it.
c16086 +++$+++ I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
c16086 +++$+++ Nothing personal --
c23612 +++$+++ Well, Spats Colombo - if I were saw one.
c23612 +++$+++ Hello, copper.  What brings you down to Florida?
c23612 +++$+++ I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
c23612 +++$+++ Big joke!
c23612 +++$+++ Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
c23612 +++$+++ Me?  I was at Rigoletto.
c23612 +++$+++ What's his first name?  And where does he live?
c23612 +++$+++ That's an opera, you ignoramus.
c23612 +++$+++ Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
c23612 +++$+++ Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
c23612 +++$+++ Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
c23612 +++$+++ Why?
c23612 +++$+++ Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
c23612 +++$+++ I cut myself shaving.
c23612 +++$+++ You shave with your spats on?
c23612 +++$+++ I sleep with my spats on.
c23612 +++$+++ Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
c23612 +++$+++ You and who else?
c23612 +++$+++ You boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses?
c21321 +++$+++ You're Walker, right?
c21321 +++$+++ Yes Sir.
c21321 +++$+++ That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
c21321 +++$+++ You liked that?
c21321 +++$+++ Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
c21321 +++$+++ Sir?
c21321 +++$+++ I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
c21321 +++$+++ Hale-what?
c21321 +++$+++ You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
c21321 +++$+++ Sir, I --
c21321 +++$+++ I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir.  I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
c18071 +++$+++ Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
c18071 +++$+++ Keeps to himself, more like.
c18071 +++$+++ Pretty sure I do.  Yeah, here we go --
c13429 +++$+++ I'm afraid to let her in the house.
c13429 +++$+++ Oh, you are...
c13429 +++$+++ Let me in the house! Fucker!
c19368 +++$+++ Where'd you learn that?
c19368 +++$+++ What?
c19368 +++$+++ That.
c19368 +++$+++ At birth.  I don't know you --
c19368 +++$+++ Harry D'Amour.
c19368 +++$+++ I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
c19368 +++$+++ I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
c19368 +++$+++ What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
c19368 +++$+++ Was he taking a lot of risks?
c19368 +++$+++ Not the Walter Wilder?
c23153 +++$+++ George...
c23153 +++$+++ I just have to do one little thing.
c23153 +++$+++ I won't screw you up.
c23368 +++$+++ Thank you.  No.  Here...
c23368 +++$+++ I insist that you have it.
c23368 +++$+++ That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
c19204 +++$+++ So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?
c19204 +++$+++ You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
c19204 +++$+++ Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
c22525 +++$+++ You were standing in the middle of the street?
c22525 +++$+++ You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
c22525 +++$+++ I love that dream.
c22525 +++$+++ That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
c22525 +++$+++ He said hello.
c01278 +++$+++ Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
c01278 +++$+++ You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
c01278 +++$+++ I lost a bet.
c11725 +++$+++ Who is that other guy?
c11725 +++$+++ Another contractor.
c11725 +++$+++ Someone hired both of you?
c11725 +++$+++ No.  They hired Bain.  The contract would have been mine, but Bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
c11725 +++$+++ So this is something between you and him?
c11725 +++$+++ He stole the contract knowing that I would come after him.
c11725 +++$+++ Why?
c11725 +++$+++ Because he is trying to retire me.
c11725 +++$+++ He wants to kill you?
c11725 +++$+++ Yes.
c11725 +++$+++ Why?
c11725 +++$+++ The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
c11725 +++$+++ And you want to use me to get him?
c11725 +++$+++ Yes.
c11725 +++$+++ We don't have a choice.
c10075 +++$+++ I think your life's about to change.
c10075 +++$+++ So you found Mary?
c10075 +++$+++ Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
c10075 +++$+++ So she hasn't changed?
c10075 +++$+++ That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
c10075 +++$+++ Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.
c13052 +++$+++ You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
c13052 +++$+++ If you say so.
c13052 +++$+++ You think these are tits don't you?
c13052 +++$+++ Ah.
c13052 +++$+++ I bet you'd like to touch them?
c13052 +++$+++ Well don't. You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! And if you don't stamp this form I'm going to blow the place up!
c24500 +++$+++ Mush!  Mush!
c24500 +++$+++ Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
c24500 +++$+++ I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
c15979 +++$+++ See the cross of the Lord. Be gone you hostile power. O'Lord hear my prayer.
c15979 +++$+++ And let my cry come unto thee.
c15979 +++$+++ And also with you.
c13905 +++$+++ My husband's at the office.
c13905 +++$+++ Actually he's not. And he's moved from his apartment at the El Macando.
c13905 +++$+++ Anyway... I... the point is, Mrs. Mulwray.  I'm not in business to be loved, but I am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. L.A.'s a small town, people talk.
c04713 +++$+++ Miles Massey.
c04713 +++$+++ Of Massey Myerson?
c04713 +++$+++ By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
c21935 +++$+++ Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
c21935 +++$+++ That sounds to me very remarkable.
c21935 +++$+++ It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
c21935 +++$+++ Maybe you're right.
c21935 +++$+++ Why didn't you notify the police?
c22356 +++$+++ Something wrong, Jesse?
c22356 +++$+++ No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
c22356 +++$+++ Well, I just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
c12940 +++$+++ Got to think this through ...
c12940 +++$+++ Caesar, maybe we should run --
c12940 +++$+++ Violet, please!
c12940 +++$+++ I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
c12940 +++$+++ All right, Caesar.
c06986 +++$+++ Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
c06986 +++$+++ Not always... look at me... I've been back twice.
c06986 +++$+++ Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
c06986 +++$+++ Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
c06986 +++$+++ Don't hold that against me... please!
c06986 +++$+++ Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
c06986 +++$+++ Business.
c06986 +++$+++ What business?
c06986 +++$+++ Private.
c06986 +++$+++ There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
c06986 +++$+++ Confess what?
c06986 +++$+++ Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
c06986 +++$+++ You believe in our cause?
c06132 +++$+++ Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
c06132 +++$+++ You put it very well.
c06132 +++$+++ You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
c06132 +++$+++ Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger.
c02950 +++$+++ "John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
c02950 +++$+++ What about him.
c02950 +++$+++ Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
c02950 +++$+++ Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
c02950 +++$+++ Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
c02950 +++$+++ Well, pardon me if I do.  Now who else?  Who could've leveraged a class officer like that?  C'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game.
c11659 +++$+++ This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
c11659 +++$+++ On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
c11659 +++$+++ Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
c11659 +++$+++ Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
c11659 +++$+++ So shoot him.  Won't have to feed him that way --
c05993 +++$+++ There a maid in this hotel?
c05993 +++$+++ I don't know, why?
c05993 +++$+++ If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
c05993 +++$+++ They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
c05993 +++$+++ What kind of cop were you before this?
c05993 +++$+++ Treasury... Then this would be your first actual murder scene.
c21247 +++$+++ I think she's after Glenn.  The girl still with you?
c21247 +++$+++ They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
c21247 +++$+++ You tell your sister about it?
c21247 +++$+++ Just hung up.
c21247 +++$+++ How long you talk to her?
c21247 +++$+++ Two hours.
c21247 +++$+++ How long were you with the girl?
c21247 +++$+++ Forty-five minutes.
c21247 +++$+++ You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
c21247 +++$+++ Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
c08403 +++$+++ Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
c08403 +++$+++ This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
c08403 +++$+++ You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay?  The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
c15412 +++$+++ Ed, everything goes off. "Cheers" went off. "Mash" went off --
c15412 +++$+++ Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
c15412 +++$+++ Ed --
c15412 +++$+++ You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
c15412 +++$+++ Ed --
c15412 +++$+++ Yeah? Well I'm not starting now.
c04077 +++$+++ He was unsual.
c04077 +++$+++ Why?
c04077 +++$+++ Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
c04077 +++$+++ Then you didn't know Richard later on.
c04077 +++$+++ No.
c04077 +++$+++ I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
c04077 +++$+++ Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
c04077 +++$+++ I don't follow you.
c04077 +++$+++ Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
c04077 +++$+++ Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son.
c09950 +++$+++ [Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
c09950 +++$+++ Yes.
c09950 +++$+++ Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
c09950 +++$+++ I know.
c09950 +++$+++ If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
c19153 +++$+++ You were acting for our benefit. And I apologize. I misunderstood you.
c19153 +++$+++ Well that is to be expected. My father...
c19153 +++$+++ Your "father"?
c19153 +++$+++ Chingachgook. He warned me about people like you.
c19153 +++$+++ He did?
c19153 +++$+++ Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
c19153 +++$+++ Yes. And "do not try to understand them.  That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense..."
c15659 +++$+++ This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich.  I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
c15659 +++$+++ What do you mean, poetry?
c15659 +++$+++ A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
c15659 +++$+++ The Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method.  Nothing to do with Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move.  The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards.  When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer.  Haunting the ostrich.
c06610 +++$+++ What'll I tell him if he calls up?
c06610 +++$+++ Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
c06610 +++$+++ What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
c02691 +++$+++ Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
c02691 +++$+++ A major!
c02691 +++$+++ We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.
c02691 +++$+++ Naw! Not a major.
c02691 +++$+++ He wanted the pineal gland.
c02691 +++$+++ That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.
c16541 +++$+++ Mass production is what does it.
c16541 +++$+++ What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
c16541 +++$+++ Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
c16541 +++$+++ Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
c16541 +++$+++ In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
c16541 +++$+++ In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
c16541 +++$+++ And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
c24232 +++$+++ We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
c24232 +++$+++ Yeah.
c24232 +++$+++ Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
c24232 +++$+++ Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
c24232 +++$+++ Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
c24232 +++$+++ Yeah, I guess.
c24232 +++$+++ You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
c24232 +++$+++ You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result.
c02339 +++$+++ Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong
c02339 +++$+++ The king can do no wrong!
c02339 +++$+++ Suppose a pretty dame Into my castle came - And let us say that I was going strong.  She might be stuck on me, but what good would it be, if the king can do no wrong.
c02339 +++$+++ The king can do to wrong!
c02339 +++$+++ King Solomon was game he gave each Girl his name to number them would make a list that long I'll bet his thousand wives led miserable lives if the king can do no wrong.
c02339 +++$+++ They think I should - They think I should - They think I should - They think I should be king.
c17006 +++$+++ Four hundred?
c17006 +++$+++ That's right.
c17006 +++$+++ No.
c26875 +++$+++ Wanna play some tennis Saturday?
c26875 +++$+++ You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
c26875 +++$+++ ...light snack, but good, thanks pal, you're sharking your way up...
c00760 +++$+++ No.
c00760 +++$+++ Oh, you think I'm lying?
c00760 +++$+++ Yes.
c00760 +++$+++ Oh, Matt.
c09310 +++$+++ He said it was a clue?
c09310 +++$+++ Maybe something to do with Zorro.
c09310 +++$+++ Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
c09310 +++$+++ This could all be a coincidence, but, you know something, I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back.  Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online?
c11564 +++$+++ Sleeping pills.
c11564 +++$+++ That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
c11564 +++$+++ Doctor.
c11564 +++$+++ Dr. Dreyfuss.
c11564 +++$+++ Get more coffee.
c12436 +++$+++ Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
c12436 +++$+++ Why me, man?
c12436 +++$+++ He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
c12436 +++$+++ Well Dude, we just don't know.
c23911 +++$+++ You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
c23911 +++$+++ That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
c23911 +++$+++ Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
c22957 +++$+++ <U>Charlie</U> <U>MacCorry</U>!...You weren't fixin' to marry HIM??
c22957 +++$+++ She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
c22957 +++$+++ As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
c22957 +++$+++ What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
c22957 +++$+++ AND other things...Mebbe you thought you was gettin' away with being comical about that Indian wife you took...I bet she wasn't the first squaw you...
c01623 +++$+++ Hold me, Don.
c01623 +++$+++ Don? Where is he?
c01623 +++$+++ HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
c01623 +++$+++ Hold me. I'M FALLING!
c02111 +++$+++ I don't like it.
c02111 +++$+++ Why not?
c02111 +++$+++ I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
c02111 +++$+++ He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
c02111 +++$+++ Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
c02111 +++$+++ -- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
c02111 +++$+++ I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
c02111 +++$+++ Marion. It's a book.
c02111 +++$+++ Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack.  There's no hope in it.
c02111 +++$+++ It's the truth.
c02111 +++$+++ Without hope there's no point to anything.
c02111 +++$+++ Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
c03189 +++$+++ Hey... so, what brings you down here?
c03189 +++$+++ I uh... I feel that I need to uh -- there's something I feel I have to say... I uh, I've never said this to anyone before -- believe me, I've stayed in horrible relationships for years just so I wouldn't have to do this, but I uh...
c03189 +++$+++ It's just that I feel like it's maybe not a good idea for us to keep going out.
c09619 +++$+++ Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
c09619 +++$+++ I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
c09619 +++$+++ Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
c17258 +++$+++ This has nothing to do with any of that --
c17258 +++$+++ Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
c17258 +++$+++ Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
c20194 +++$+++ Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean's life.
c20194 +++$+++ I'd like a little more conviction..
c20194 +++$+++ So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
c20194 +++$+++ Something like that.
c08190 +++$+++ Alright... I might need your help.
c08190 +++$+++ My help?
c08190 +++$+++ A little bit... Give me your belt.
c08190 +++$+++ Okay, give me my belt.
c20703 +++$+++ Did you see who that was?
c20703 +++$+++ Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
c20703 +++$+++ I'1l get your bag.
c09247 +++$+++ This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
c09247 +++$+++ Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
c09247 +++$+++ What're you going to do?
c09852 +++$+++ Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
c09852 +++$+++ Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
c09852 +++$+++ I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
c13055 +++$+++ What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
c13055 +++$+++ Looking for you.
c13055 +++$+++ No, really.
c13055 +++$+++ Really.
c13055 +++$+++ I mean, it doesn't suit you.
c13055 +++$+++ Suit me?
c13055 +++$+++ Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
c13055 +++$+++ What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
c13055 +++$+++ We've got both.
c13055 +++$+++ They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
c18382 +++$+++ I love you.
c18382 +++$+++ That's nice. Are you drunk?
c18382 +++$+++ I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
c27223 +++$+++ Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
c27223 +++$+++ He accused John of taking kickbacks. And you know - anybody who knows John - knows that's a goddamn lie!
c27223 +++$+++ Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
c27223 +++$+++ Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
c27223 +++$+++ Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him -
c27223 +++$+++ But... if you had to guess?
c03243 +++$+++ Do you have any other old records besides these?
c03243 +++$+++ Seymour does.
c03243 +++$+++ Him. Seymour. He's the man with the records.
c17087 +++$+++ Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
c17087 +++$+++ What do I...?
c17087 +++$+++ Yes.
c17087 +++$+++ I don't know.  For me, I'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm.  Some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. There was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, I'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me cafe au lait.  She gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.  Eh?  What I'm saying, what is our life?  It's looking forward or it's looking back.  And that's our life. That's it.  Where is the moment?  And what is it that we're afraid of? Loss.  What else?  The bank closes.  We get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? None on 'em.  We worry anyway. What does this mean?  I'm not secure.  How can I be secure?  Through amassing wealth beyond all measure?  No.  And what's beyond all measure?  That's a sickness. That's a trap.  There is no measure. Only greed.  How can we act?
c10813 +++$+++ These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
c10813 +++$+++ And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
c10813 +++$+++ It couldn't have come from anywhere else. At least, somewhere from that vicinity... But I really can't understand it. Contraband cigarettes on that island! It's the first time that ever happened.
c10813 +++$+++ Look... I'd like to get back to Lisca Bianca.
c10813 +++$+++ But how could we...at a time like this when we just... well, let's at least first have a look around the other islands. Could be that something might turn up there.
c10813 +++$+++ As you wish.
c05963 +++$+++ Why did you catch that?
c05963 +++$+++ Because it was going to fall.
c05963 +++$+++ You're certain?
c05963 +++$+++ But it didn't fall.  You caught it.
c04874 +++$+++ Willie, are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal?  Under the supervision of a doctor?
c04874 +++$+++ Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you can tell'em all I told you so.
c04874 +++$+++ You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
c04874 +++$+++ Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
c04874 +++$+++ You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
c05436 +++$+++ A Book Society Award is a very prestigious thing.
c05436 +++$+++ Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
c05436 +++$+++ No.
c05436 +++$+++ Then why?
c05436 +++$+++ Exactly.  No reason.  No occasion. It just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  How come you'd do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
c25557 +++$+++ What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
c25557 +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
c25557 +++$+++ The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
c25557 +++$+++ Maybe I will.
c25557 +++$+++ But Wynant --- ?
c25557 +++$+++ I don't believe he did it.
c25557 +++$+++ Why don't you?
c25557 +++$+++ No reason.  Just a hunch.  But I'm going to find out.  I'm tired of being pushed around.
c25557 +++$+++ Come on, Watson, we're going places.
c06638 +++$+++ Thanks  Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
c06638 +++$+++ Jim Mason?  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is.  "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
c06638 +++$+++ Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
c06638 +++$+++ He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
c10969 +++$+++ Are you okay in there?
c10969 +++$+++ Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
c10969 +++$+++ Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
c06248 +++$+++ Your kid brother got married last Sunday, eh, Marty?
c06248 +++$+++ That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
c06248 +++$+++ That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
c06248 +++$+++ I thought he was a big tall fat fellow. Didn't I meet him here one time? Big tall, fat fellow, he tried to sell me life insurance?
c06299 +++$+++ O'Reilly, what is it?  There aren't more choppers coming?
c06299 +++$+++ I'm afraid so, Colonel.
c06299 +++$+++ Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
c14088 +++$+++ So your argument is that title dictates behavior?
c14088 +++$+++ What?
c14088 +++$+++ Exactly.
c05280 +++$+++ Right.
c05280 +++$+++ And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
c05280 +++$+++ He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
c12568 +++$+++ Just let it go, I've got you!
c12568 +++$+++ What're you nuts--
c12568 +++$+++ --shit!!!
c06018 +++$+++ Whu --
c06018 +++$+++ There's no touching.
c06018 +++$+++ I don't give a shit. I work for her. No touching.
c03396 +++$+++ Who are you?  Narcissus The Good?  I have heard of Narcissus Meridas. That's who I hear you are.
c03396 +++$+++ You're hearing about somebody else.
c03396 +++$+++ How did you get condemned to the arena without a trial?
c03396 +++$+++ When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
c03396 +++$+++ Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
c03396 +++$+++ I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
c03396 +++$+++ You don't know how wrong you are.
c18242 +++$+++ My God, that was bold of you, you didn't have to do that...
c18242 +++$+++ Forget about it--it was nothing-- anybody would have done the same thing--It's an impulse...
c18242 +++$+++ Excuse me, Milady.  I would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud, but I left my cape at the cleaners.
c19169 +++$+++ Gold could be arranged.
c19169 +++$+++ For Munro children?
c19169 +++$+++ Yes.
c19169 +++$+++ The King? The King has mountains of gold!
c06883 +++$+++ I talk to her or you can forget about it.
c06883 +++$+++ Don't you threaten me.
c06883 +++$+++ What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
c06883 +++$+++ What? Walk out there and twist her arm off?
c02155 +++$+++ You are false data.
c02155 +++$+++ Huh?
c02155 +++$+++ Therefore, I shall ignore you.
c02155 +++$+++ Hello, bomb.
c02155 +++$+++ False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
c02155 +++$+++ Hey, bomb.
c02155 +++$+++ Bomb?
c12055 +++$+++ Come on.
c12055 +++$+++ Wanna Mac?
c12055 +++$+++ No, I'd like the scarf.
c12055 +++$+++ Have a Mac.
c12055 +++$+++ I don't eat junk food.
c12055 +++$+++ Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
c12055 +++$+++ No name? That's ok. I'll just call you Big Pink.
c22107 +++$+++ Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
c22107 +++$+++ Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
c22107 +++$+++ What do you remember?
c22107 +++$+++ Just...images, really. Feelings.
c22107 +++$+++ She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
c05510 +++$+++ Up for a celebration dinner?
c05510 +++$+++ Are you asking me on a date?
c05510 +++$+++ As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
c05510 +++$+++ So Friday at eight?
c17197 +++$+++ I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
c17197 +++$+++ I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
c17197 +++$+++ Everybody has stories to tell.
c17197 +++$+++ Not me.
c17197 +++$+++ I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
c27447 +++$+++ All right -- give it to him!
c27447 +++$+++ Are you serious??
c27447 +++$+++ Oh!  Yes, Doctor.
c21325 +++$+++ Didn't you say you told her not to come?
c21325 +++$+++ Yeah.
c21325 +++$+++ It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
c02611 +++$+++ Johnny? Did you see Ben?
c02611 +++$+++ Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
c02611 +++$+++ At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
c09540 +++$+++ Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
c09540 +++$+++ Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
c09540 +++$+++ But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
c09540 +++$+++ Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
c09540 +++$+++ Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key, say open up, step inside, but you can't because it's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was...
c02163 +++$+++ Pinback...
c02163 +++$+++ Yes, Doolittle.
c02163 +++$+++ Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
c02163 +++$+++ Doolittle...
c02163 +++$+++ Yes.
c02163 +++$+++ I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
c02163 +++$+++ Boiler, can you set me up with some temp figures?
c26765 +++$+++ I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
c26765 +++$+++ In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
c26765 +++$+++ I'm afraid that his health is not good. He's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. You will certainly never see him again.
c08034 +++$+++ Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
c08034 +++$+++ They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
c08034 +++$+++ He working for them on this one?
c08034 +++$+++ No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
c08034 +++$+++ And I'm his ticket.  What's the last place they took down?
c08034 +++$+++ Gabriel and his guys. What's the last place they robbed?
c22278 +++$+++ What are you doing?
c22278 +++$+++ Don't cross me...
c22278 +++$+++ Nobody's going to do that!
c22278 +++$+++ Really?
c22278 +++$+++ I need you, Swede, I can't do this without you!
c22278 +++$+++ I do, I do...
c26410 +++$+++ I'm listening.
c26410 +++$+++ I'll keep it in my office room.
c26410 +++$+++ I have a lock on the door.
c26790 +++$+++ Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
c26790 +++$+++ Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
c26790 +++$+++ In order to find him, we have to understand what makes him tick...
c17259 +++$+++ Cool. So you're living up North?
c17259 +++$+++ Yeah -
c17259 +++$+++ I heard you were pumping gas -
c17259 +++$+++ Something like that -
c17259 +++$+++ Yeah --
c18256 +++$+++ The Hoopsucker!
c18256 +++$+++ The Hudswinger!
c18256 +++$+++ The Hudsucker Hoop!
c26899 +++$+++ Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
c26899 +++$+++ I don't understand.
c26899 +++$+++ Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
c26899 +++$+++ Inside information. Oh you mean like when a father tells his son about a court ruling on an airline? Or someone overhears me saying I'm gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the chairman of the board of XYZ suddenly knows it's time to blow out XYZ. You mean that?  I'm afraid sport, unless you got a father on the board of directors of another company, you and I are gonna have a hard time doing any business...
c26673 +++$+++ It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
c26673 +++$+++ Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
c26673 +++$+++ Boyd brought up divorce statistics.
c11210 +++$+++ But, but -- what would I do?
c11210 +++$+++ Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
c11210 +++$+++ That's stupid.
c11210 +++$+++ Oh...oh...oh, shit!
c06739 +++$+++ How'd a guy like you end up in the Legion anyways?
c06739 +++$+++ I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
c06739 +++$+++ Exactly! I speak seven languages, including Hebrew, so my specialty was synagogues. How about you? Kill somebody?
c09233 +++$+++ They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
c09233 +++$+++ Save us all a lot of trouble.
c09233 +++$+++ Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
c09233 +++$+++ Bullshit!
c09233 +++$+++ You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that?
c04234 +++$+++ He's never going to come back. He's gone off to be a soldier and Mummy doesn't even know.
c04234 +++$+++ It doesn't matter, I can drive the car home.
c04234 +++$+++ You wouldn't.
c04234 +++$+++ Would.
c04234 +++$+++ Could.
c09665 +++$+++ What?
c09665 +++$+++ The little Brenner girl.
c09665 +++$+++ Lois!
c09665 +++$+++ It's Alice, ain't it?
c09665 +++$+++ It's Alice.
c17642 +++$+++ Jesus!
c17642 +++$+++ You all right?
c17642 +++$+++ Sure...
c17642 +++$+++ Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
c17642 +++$+++ You have the wrong feeling.
c17642 +++$+++ You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
c17642 +++$+++ Exactly what do you need?
c17642 +++$+++ Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
c17642 +++$+++ I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
c17642 +++$+++ More fancy talk... You want to know what Haddonfield is? Families. Children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
c17642 +++$+++ I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
c13654 +++$+++ Jude?
c13654 +++$+++ Yes?
c13654 +++$+++ Some judge...
c09728 +++$+++ I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
c09728 +++$+++ You're made for a doctor, young man!
c09728 +++$+++ I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
c09728 +++$+++ You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
c09728 +++$+++ I thought only the best students were made assistants.
c09728 +++$+++ Well? And are you not a good student?
c09728 +++$+++ Richardson is a fine student.  He's got a glib tongue, but you'll be a better doctor, Fettes.  Come along now --
c01109 +++$+++ So Seagrave and Holcomb were accountants...
c01109 +++$+++ And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
c01109 +++$+++ Who all ended up wearing candles for faces...  Swayzak's up to his ass in this somehow. Guy can barely hold a drink in his hand, he's so scared.
c08451 +++$+++ Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
c08451 +++$+++ But you wanted to fuck me first.
c08451 +++$+++ Yeah.
c09421 +++$+++ Definitely. Two days. That's the industry standard...
c09421 +++$+++ ...I used to wait two days. Now everyone waits two days. Three days is kinda money now, don't you think?
c09421 +++$+++ Yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
c19737 +++$+++ Hello, hotshot!
c19737 +++$+++ Hey, baby! Where are you?
c19737 +++$+++ At the store. You doin' some good?
c19737 +++$+++ None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
c19737 +++$+++ Me, too. And very erotic...
c19737 +++$+++ Tell me about yourself.
c19737 +++$+++ Which part? That or the day-to-day.
c19737 +++$+++ Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
c19737 +++$+++ Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
c19737 +++$+++ Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
c19737 +++$+++ Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
c19737 +++$+++ I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
c19737 +++$+++ I have to see somebody.
c23965 +++$+++ Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
c23965 +++$+++ I'll be there.
c23965 +++$+++ You bringing your new friend?
c23965 +++$+++ Sure plan to.
c23965 +++$+++ He have any special dietary requirements...?
c23965 +++$+++ He'll eat potroast and like it.
c23965 +++$+++ You bet your life.
c11529 +++$+++ Where is your apartment?
c11529 +++$+++ West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
c11529 +++$+++ Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --
c21155 +++$+++ You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
c21155 +++$+++ Sure we keep records!
c21155 +++$+++ Well, where are they?
c21155 +++$+++ We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
c21155 +++$+++ Doesn't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records?
c21155 +++$+++ That's all. Next witness!
c08441 +++$+++ Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
c08441 +++$+++ Yeah, I know.
c08441 +++$+++ I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
c25319 +++$+++ And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leon's Austrian was looking for you I reckon he'd have found you before I did.
c25319 +++$+++ I'm sorry. It's just you don't look local...
c25319 +++$+++ He'd come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... 'Sleeping Beauty'. The Disney film...  Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldn't watch...
c21464 +++$+++ How many gays do you know?
c21464 +++$+++ How many do you know?
c21464 +++$+++ Lots.
c21464 +++$+++ Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.
c27238 +++$+++ As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
c27238 +++$+++ But we've got to verify it legally To see...
c27238 +++$+++ To see?
c27238 +++$+++ If she...
c27238 +++$+++ Is morally, ethic'ly
c22507 +++$+++ The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
c22507 +++$+++ -- who's married to --
c22507 +++$+++ Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
c22507 +++$+++ -- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
c22507 +++$+++ -- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
c05558 +++$+++ Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
c05558 +++$+++ Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
c05558 +++$+++ Fire away!
c25361 +++$+++ Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
c25361 +++$+++ In a village called Domremy.
c25361 +++$+++ How old are you?
c25361 +++$+++ Nineteen... or thereabouts...
c25361 +++$+++ Were you baptized?
c25361 +++$+++ Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
c25361 +++$+++ Not unless you hear my confession.
c02550 +++$+++ To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
c02550 +++$+++ Tired...
c02550 +++$+++ That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
c02550 +++$+++ A born freak can only go uphill.
c02550 +++$+++ Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
c02550 +++$+++ I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
c02550 +++$+++ Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
c09284 +++$+++ We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
c09284 +++$+++ You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
c09284 +++$+++ I've got a good idea, yeah.
c09284 +++$+++ Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.
c08019 +++$+++ I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
c08019 +++$+++ One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
c08019 +++$+++ I've been doing good, though.
c08019 +++$+++ Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
c08019 +++$+++ What, he should see me help you catch him?
c06153 +++$+++ [Where are you coming from?]
c06153 +++$+++ [South America.]
c06153 +++$+++ [Where are you staying in Mexico?]
c06153 +++$+++ [I'm on to Juarez.]
c06153 +++$+++ [I have a friend there.]
c10279 +++$+++ You didn't cook breakfast?
c10279 +++$+++ Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
c10279 +++$+++ Hell you did.  Your turn.
c20867 +++$+++ That's not going to help.
c20867 +++$+++ The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
c20867 +++$+++ Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
c20867 +++$+++ Go ahead...
c14475 +++$+++ I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
c14475 +++$+++ I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
c14475 +++$+++ Oh, Letty, what happened?
c14475 +++$+++ Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
c14475 +++$+++ I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
c14475 +++$+++ I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
c14475 +++$+++ I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
c23281 +++$+++ I want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
c23281 +++$+++ You're not going to let it go, are you?
c23281 +++$+++ Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
c17648 +++$+++ I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
c17648 +++$+++ There was no one outside.
c17648 +++$+++ There WAS.
c17648 +++$+++ What did he look like?
c17648 +++$+++ The bogyman!
c17648 +++$+++ We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
c17648 +++$+++ Right.
c17648 +++$+++ And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
c17648 +++$+++ Promise?
c17648 +++$+++ Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?
c07937 +++$+++ Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
c07937 +++$+++ Now, Lisa --
c07937 +++$+++ Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
c07937 +++$+++ Do you think I consider this recreation?
c07937 +++$+++ I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
c07937 +++$+++ You'd better before you catch the disease!
c07937 +++$+++ What is it you're looking for?
c07937 +++$+++ I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
c07937 +++$+++ What makes you think something's wrong with her?
c07937 +++$+++ A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
c07937 +++$+++ Maybe she died.
c07937 +++$+++ She could be under sedatives, sleeping.  He's in the room now.
c03691 +++$+++ It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
c03691 +++$+++ You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
c03691 +++$+++ It was Jamie Lloyd.  She came back, as I knew she would one day.  And whatever has brought her back has brought Michael back as well.
c03691 +++$+++ That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your help to stop him.
c01042 +++$+++ Cole, we've got to talk.
c01042 +++$+++ Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
c01042 +++$+++ No, Cole, I...
c01042 +++$+++ It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
c01042 +++$+++ Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
c01042 +++$+++ You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
c01042 +++$+++ Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
c01042 +++$+++ I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
c18782 +++$+++ Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
c18782 +++$+++ What?
c18782 +++$+++ What's a bad idea?
c06592 +++$+++ Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
c06592 +++$+++ Yes.
c06592 +++$+++ Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
c06592 +++$+++ Yes!
c06592 +++$+++ Are these the articles?
c06592 +++$+++ Yes!
c06592 +++$+++ Were you present when all these things took place?
c06592 +++$+++ Yes!
c06592 +++$+++ Are they true!
c06592 +++$+++ NO!!
c06592 +++$+++ But they did take place?
c06592 +++$+++ They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
c06592 +++$+++ And you saw them happen?
c06592 +++$+++ Yes, but I--
c06592 +++$+++ That's all, Miss Bennett.
c06592 +++$+++ That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
c22651 +++$+++ What's that smell?
c22651 +++$+++ That would be me.
c22651 +++$+++ Hell, yes!  What the hell do you expect zapping Mr. Johnson with that crackler?
c02920 +++$+++ Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
c02920 +++$+++ Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
c02920 +++$+++ Really, I have no problem with --
c02920 +++$+++ I'm not out to change your sex, lieutenant.  You'll have separate beds, separate heads.  If you have specific medical needs, inform the infirmary.  If a classmate or superior acts in an harassing or otherwise unbecoming manner, please inform me immediately so I can deal with it immediately.  Questions?
c02920 +++$+++ Then that's all I have to say. Dismissed.
c21626 +++$+++ Was that about the right angle?
c21626 +++$+++ I think so.
c21626 +++$+++ Should be over there.
c00957 +++$+++ Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
c00957 +++$+++ Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
c00957 +++$+++ My mother's told me all about you.
c00957 +++$+++ My mother's doing quite well, thank you very much.
c04385 +++$+++ How long you been waiting?
c04385 +++$+++ What?
c04385 +++$+++ Since four.
c21290 +++$+++ Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
c21290 +++$+++ I don't know.  I never used a gun.
c21290 +++$+++ Really?
c21290 +++$+++ You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
c21290 +++$+++ You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
c21290 +++$+++ No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
c21290 +++$+++ I know what you're talking about.
c21290 +++$+++ You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
c21290 +++$+++ Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
c21290 +++$+++ Of course not.
c21290 +++$+++ Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
c21290 +++$+++ It's a big house.
c24513 +++$+++ Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
c24513 +++$+++ What about here?
c24513 +++$+++ Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
c24513 +++$+++ Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
c24513 +++$+++ No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
c09680 +++$+++ Where's Mitch?
c09680 +++$+++ Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
c09680 +++$+++ Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
c09680 +++$+++ He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
c09680 +++$+++ Then he saw.
c09680 +++$+++ What good will they do?
c18327 +++$+++ You're staring at me.
c18327 +++$+++ I wasn't star--
c18327 +++$+++ I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
c18327 +++$+++ That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
c18327 +++$+++ Why shouldn't she be?
c05262 +++$+++ Telly says was up.
c05262 +++$+++ I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
c05262 +++$+++ Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
c17973 +++$+++ I apologize for that scene with my husband.  You must have overheard.
c17973 +++$+++ An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
c17973 +++$+++ It's a living.
c24390 +++$+++ The rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
c24390 +++$+++ It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
c24390 +++$+++ And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
c24390 +++$+++ These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
c24390 +++$+++ Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
c24390 +++$+++ You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
c24390 +++$+++ You think I made that up about the gun...
c05132 +++$+++ Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
c05132 +++$+++ I don't think so.
c05132 +++$+++ You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
c05132 +++$+++ But it's breakfast for supper. Your favorite, Paulie. I made French toast and sausage. Patties, not linkies, just like you like it.
c14261 +++$+++ Slow the hell down!
c14261 +++$+++ What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
c14261 +++$+++ Vincent?
c08552 +++$+++ Hal, what are you doing?
c08552 +++$+++ Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
c08552 +++$+++ Absolutely not!
c08552 +++$+++ But she's right there!  I must feel her!
c08552 +++$+++ You can't.
c08552 +++$+++ Why not?
c08552 +++$+++ There's... a wall between you --
c08552 +++$+++ -- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
c08552 +++$+++ -- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
c08552 +++$+++ I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together.  Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago.  Let's move on.
c04780 +++$+++ Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
c04780 +++$+++ I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
c04780 +++$+++ Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
c04780 +++$+++ Egg. One egg--doughnuts--black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
c04780 +++$+++ Nope. No complaints.
c04780 +++$+++ I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
c04780 +++$+++ Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
c04780 +++$+++ What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
c04780 +++$+++ Must be the Spring.
c04780 +++$+++ I thought maybe--uh--"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
c04780 +++$+++ He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
c04780 +++$+++ Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
c04780 +++$+++ Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
c04780 +++$+++ No. No. It's too good a story.
c04780 +++$+++ Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
c04780 +++$+++ Yeah?
c04780 +++$+++ It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
c04780 +++$+++ Um. You're doing all right.
c04780 +++$+++ Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
c04780 +++$+++ One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
c04780 +++$+++ It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I--I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
c04780 +++$+++ Santa Claus?
c04780 +++$+++ King--King Westley was in it.
c04780 +++$+++ Oh. Is that how you met him?
c04780 +++$+++ Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged.
c04780 +++$+++ Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
c04780 +++$+++ Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
c04780 +++$+++ Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
c04780 +++$+++ Thanks, professor.
c04780 +++$+++ I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
c21698 +++$+++ Sorry.
c21698 +++$+++ Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
c21698 +++$+++ The fucking punks are surfers.
c26452 +++$+++ Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
c26452 +++$+++ Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
c26452 +++$+++ Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
c26452 +++$+++ Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
c26452 +++$+++ Duke.
c26452 +++$+++ Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns."
c26452 +++$+++ I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
c26452 +++$+++ You were there?
c11531 +++$+++ This?
c11531 +++$+++ That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
c11531 +++$+++ Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
c14041 +++$+++ Maybe you should take that coffee outside.
c14041 +++$+++ No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
c14041 +++$+++ Okay. I'm sorry about that.
c17458 +++$+++ Tell me about yourself.
c17458 +++$+++ I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
c17458 +++$+++ That's it?
c17458 +++$+++ Not much else.
c17458 +++$+++ What's your business?
c17458 +++$+++ Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
c27444 +++$+++ Inga!
c27444 +++$+++ Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
c27444 +++$+++ Inga, wake up!
c27444 +++$+++ What is it?  Is something wrong, Doctor?
c27444 +++$+++ Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
c27444 +++$+++ I don't know.  It just woke me up.
c02148 +++$+++ The key, goddamit, the key!
c02148 +++$+++ Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
c02148 +++$+++ We're gonna die, Boiler. We're gonna die.
c18478 +++$+++ Woman, what are you doing here?
c18478 +++$+++ I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in --- entombed ---- imprisoned..
c18478 +++$+++ He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
c18478 +++$+++ He's dead enough. God rest his soul.
c23675 +++$+++ Howya do, Rebecca. I sorta been expectin' you this mornin'.
c23675 +++$+++ I wanta see Nathan.
c23675 +++$+++ I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
c23675 +++$+++ I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
c23675 +++$+++ It's the rules and I gotta follow 'em. No visitin' 'cept holidays and Sunday -- and no womenfolk anytime.
c23675 +++$+++ You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
c23675 +++$+++ That's the way they do things here in Landsdown. I just follow orders.
c23675 +++$+++ I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
c23675 +++$+++ I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
c23675 +++$+++ Will they give him a trial?
c23675 +++$+++ You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
c03638 +++$+++ He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
c03638 +++$+++ And when he got serious?
c03638 +++$+++ He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
c03638 +++$+++ I thought these people were broke.
c03638 +++$+++ No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
c03638 +++$+++ And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
c03638 +++$+++ Yeah? How?
c12134 +++$+++ Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
c12134 +++$+++ Wait. You can't go.
c12134 +++$+++ No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
c11474 +++$+++ Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
c11474 +++$+++ Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
c11474 +++$+++ Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
c18548 +++$+++ I don't know about him -- I'm going down to the dock, maybe go sailing.
c18548 +++$+++ Every day?
c18548 +++$+++ What else is there to do?
c18548 +++$+++ You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
c18548 +++$+++ You'll have to make up your own mind about that.
c12538 +++$+++ I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
c12538 +++$+++ I don't...I don't understand them myself.
c12538 +++$+++ Try, please, Anna--
c12538 +++$+++ --bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
c12538 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c12538 +++$+++ A coward too. That's why she had to go.
c12538 +++$+++ What happened to her, where did she go?
c12538 +++$+++ --Anna--
c26963 +++$+++ How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
c26963 +++$+++ What are you going to do?
c26963 +++$+++ I don't know.
c26963 +++$+++ If she was dangerous before--
c26963 +++$+++ She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
c26963 +++$+++ No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
c23049 +++$+++ Here we come at last, my lord!
c23049 +++$+++ Are you bringing your laundry woman?
c23049 +++$+++ Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin.  My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
c23049 +++$+++ Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches!
c16373 +++$+++ The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
c16373 +++$+++ Hum.
c16373 +++$+++ Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
c14987 +++$+++ C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
c14987 +++$+++ I came to see Merle.
c14987 +++$+++ Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
c14987 +++$+++ Yeah.
c14987 +++$+++ You are his friend.
c14987 +++$+++ Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
c01914 +++$+++ I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
c01914 +++$+++ Richard, I had to see you.
c01914 +++$+++ You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
c01914 +++$+++ Please.
c01914 +++$+++ Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
c01914 +++$+++ You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
c01914 +++$+++ I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
c01914 +++$+++ I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
c01914 +++$+++ Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
c01914 +++$+++ I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
c07497 +++$+++ Say again?
c07497 +++$+++ I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
c07497 +++$+++ Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
c07497 +++$+++ Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
c07497 +++$+++ A fool's errand.
c07497 +++$+++ And you've got that, have you?
c08353 +++$+++ BREAKING OUT
c08353 +++$+++ BREAKING OUT
c08353 +++$+++ BREAKING OUT
c08353 +++$+++ BREAKING OUT
c08353 +++$+++ BREAKING OUT
c20514 +++$+++ Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
c20514 +++$+++ If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
c20514 +++$+++ I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
c20514 +++$+++ Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
c20514 +++$+++ Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
c20514 +++$+++ My own sit down Star Wars arcade game. Wanna play it ?
c21767 +++$+++ You broke my nose.
c21767 +++$+++ I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
c21767 +++$+++ Edward, we've been together ten years.
c21767 +++$+++ And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
c21767 +++$+++ Yes.
c27135 +++$+++ Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
c27135 +++$+++ Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
c27135 +++$+++ I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
c27135 +++$+++ Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
c18470 +++$+++ There was some trouble here ----the villagers on the mainland ---this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here ----broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
c18470 +++$+++ All the graves?
c18470 +++$+++ I donut understand.
c01634 +++$+++ God, you scared me.
c01634 +++$+++ Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
c01634 +++$+++ You can't just stay out half the night and carry on, Jeffrey. There's got to be some order, Jeffrey. I thought it would have been nice to call your father when you got home but now it is much too late.
c08587 +++$+++ I got an award once. From the Mayor.
c08587 +++$+++ Congratulations.
c08587 +++$+++ Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
c08587 +++$+++ You use needles?
c08587 +++$+++ No.
c08587 +++$+++ Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
c08587 +++$+++ That's good.
c22977 +++$+++ Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
c22977 +++$+++ From the beginning...
c22977 +++$+++ 'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
c22977 +++$+++ Dear Miss Laury...I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Com- anches the late Mister Futterman told us about...
c15454 +++$+++ Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
c15454 +++$+++ What's the dif --
c15454 +++$+++ Richie!  She spent six months dating a criminal
c15454 +++$+++ "Quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. Oh man, I gotta pee.
c05999 +++$+++ You know I need to use you.
c05999 +++$+++ To what?  Trap him?
c05999 +++$+++ To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
c05999 +++$+++ But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
c14021 +++$+++ First of all -
c14021 +++$+++ What's wrong, Brad?
c14021 +++$+++ I'll get you some coffee.
c20977 +++$+++ To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
c20977 +++$+++ You've got to go.
c20977 +++$+++ Why?
c20977 +++$+++ Your boyfriend?
c03865 +++$+++ Do you often model for Glaucus?
c03865 +++$+++ Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
c03865 +++$+++ Me! No. Of course not.
c03865 +++$+++ Really. Do you think it's wrong?
c03865 +++$+++ Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
c15443 +++$+++ I tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to Atlantic City.
c15443 +++$+++ So?
c15443 +++$+++ So my little brother's staying here. I'm sleeping with Rita.
c15443 +++$+++ Oh Je -- couldn't he sleep with Rita? We'11 all have a good time.
c15443 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c15443 +++$+++ Come on, let's go.
c15443 +++$+++ Somewhere.
c04934 +++$+++ Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
c04934 +++$+++ I hesitated taking that much.
c04934 +++$+++ I'm sure.
c15780 +++$+++ What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
c15780 +++$+++ So you say.
c15780 +++$+++ He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
c15780 +++$+++ That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!
c15083 +++$+++ Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
c15083 +++$+++ But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
c15083 +++$+++ Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
c21048 +++$+++ Hey, Cheswick! Wake up!
c21048 +++$+++ Yeah, Mack, what is it?
c21048 +++$+++ I'm leaving. Goodbye!
c21048 +++$+++ Shhh...
c01738 +++$+++ This is my business manager, Rowboat.
c01738 +++$+++ Nice to meet you.
c01738 +++$+++ Thanks.
c25049 +++$+++ What is it?
c25049 +++$+++ A weak vaccine against the virus Agent Scully has been infected with. It must be administered with ninety six hours.
c25049 +++$+++ You're lying.
c25049 +++$+++ No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
c25049 +++$+++ A virus?
c25049 +++$+++ A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
c25049 +++$+++ No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
c17056 +++$+++ Why?
c17056 +++$+++ The leads are assigned randomly...
c17056 +++$+++ Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
c17056 +++$+++ ...apart from the top men on the contest board.
c17056 +++$+++ Then put me on the board.
c17056 +++$+++ You start closing again, you'll be on the board.
c17056 +++$+++ I can't do it, Shel.
c20020 +++$+++ It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
c20020 +++$+++ You don't have to remember to be hungry.
c20020 +++$+++ It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
c20020 +++$+++ Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
c20020 +++$+++ The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
c06772 +++$+++ I've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a waitress.
c06772 +++$+++ Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
c06772 +++$+++ What's your real name?
c06772 +++$+++ Have you always lived here?
c10496 +++$+++ Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
c10496 +++$+++ Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
c10496 +++$+++ The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
c18620 +++$+++ Lunch for Whitey.  Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
c18620 +++$+++ We're taking that shark alive!
c18620 +++$+++ Let's hope he knows that.
c18620 +++$+++ I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
c18620 +++$+++ Because I don't trust you, that's why.
c09449 +++$+++ We'll let the old man take it easy for a couple of weeks.  I want to get things going good before he gets better.  What's the matter with you?
c09449 +++$+++ You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
c09449 +++$+++ No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
c09449 +++$+++ Well it's war!  We might not be in this shape if we had a real war- time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop had Genco, who do I have?  Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday, we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be sore.
c09052 +++$+++ Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
c09052 +++$+++ And our people?
c09052 +++$+++ They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
c09052 +++$+++ Are they in any danger?
c09052 +++$+++ Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
c07364 +++$+++ It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
c07364 +++$+++ Yeah.  Kidnapping.
c07364 +++$+++ Not if we keep 'em here.  You can't kidnap somebody in their own house. It's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  Or something like that, I'm pretty sure.
c07364 +++$+++ I am.  I'm an idiot's son.  An idiot's grandson.  I'm third- generation idiot.  But for once in my life I had a good idea, and I'm not giving up so easy.  You are? Are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early?  I can't believe my eyes.  Fourteen million dollars upstairs, Burnham.  You'll be out of the hole. Baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green.  Come on, Buddy.  One more hand.
c12320 +++$+++ ... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
c12320 +++$+++ No, that won't do any good.
c12320 +++$+++ ... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
c12320 +++$+++ Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
c12320 +++$+++ It's not that, I just...
c27190 +++$+++ The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
c27190 +++$+++ You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
c27190 +++$+++ No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
c27144 +++$+++ What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
c27144 +++$+++ What?
c27144 +++$+++ Yeah.  But I got my bike.
c06241 +++$+++ It's loaded with what?
c06241 +++$+++ Tomatoes.
c06241 +++$+++ Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
c06241 +++$+++ Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
c06241 +++$+++ Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
c06241 +++$+++ Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
c06241 +++$+++ Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
c06241 +++$+++ You gonna get married.
c06241 +++$+++ Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
c06241 +++$+++ Marty...
c06241 +++$+++ Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
c06241 +++$+++ You gonna die without a son.
c06241 +++$+++ So I'll die without a son.
c06241 +++$+++ Put on your blue suit...
c06241 +++$+++ Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
c06241 +++$+++ You not ugly.
c06241 +++$+++ I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
c06241 +++$+++ Ma! Leave me alone!
c06275 +++$+++ Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
c06275 +++$+++ Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
c06275 +++$+++ Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
c06275 +++$+++ So if it ain't staring us in the face, it's got to be retroperitoneal. And that, along with the look of the wounds, makes me figure he's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we won't find unless we look for it.
c10416 +++$+++ They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
c10416 +++$+++ Right. Who called?
c10416 +++$+++ The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
c10416 +++$+++ ...and you're going to do that?
c10416 +++$+++ You're going to settle out of court?
c20035 +++$+++ About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
c20035 +++$+++ I was the kids' godfather.
c20035 +++$+++ And...?
c20035 +++$+++ I got to know.  There is never any room for "personal"...
c11117 +++$+++ Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
c11117 +++$+++ Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
c11117 +++$+++ They'd die without each other.
c16914 +++$+++ Feel good?
c16914 +++$+++ Yeah.
c16914 +++$+++ I want to take a walk.
c16453 +++$+++ Who're you?
c16453 +++$+++ American.  Come to get you out.
c16453 +++$+++ Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
c16453 +++$+++ I could a couple of days ago.  Gonna be... stiff.
c21579 +++$+++ This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere?
c21579 +++$+++ They'll look for you.
c21579 +++$+++ I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
c21579 +++$+++ And Betty Mayfield--
c21579 +++$+++ Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
c21579 +++$+++ But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
c21579 +++$+++ If they had any reason to.  Why make it tough for themselves?  Why go to all that trouble?  Here's an open book.  Close it.  No reason to keep it open.  She was a nice girl, anyway.  And perhaps she didn't kill him on purpose.  Perhaps she didn't kill the other one. You never know.  Give her the benefit of the doubt.  Leave her stay where she is.  Close the book. Finis.
c21579 +++$+++ The best interference runner we've got.  He thinks he's in love with you--and he's a gentleman.  Come here, baby.
c24294 +++$+++ What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.
c24294 +++$+++ Camel jockey.
c24294 +++$+++ Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
c21378 +++$+++ Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
c21378 +++$+++ First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
c21378 +++$+++ God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
c21378 +++$+++ Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
c21378 +++$+++ Touchy, touchy!
c06384 +++$+++ I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
c06384 +++$+++ You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
c06384 +++$+++ It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
c06384 +++$+++ I've proved that, didn't I?
c20577 +++$+++ So what's wrong?
c20577 +++$+++ Nothing, nothing at all.
c20577 +++$+++ I mean...with your car.
c20577 +++$+++ Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
c20577 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c20577 +++$+++ I was commenting on your hair.
c20577 +++$+++ Oh, are you a hairdresser?
c20577 +++$+++ I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
c20577 +++$+++ Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
c10095 +++$+++ What's he like?
c10095 +++$+++ I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
c10095 +++$+++ What's a mook?
c10095 +++$+++ You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
c10095 +++$+++ Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
c10095 +++$+++ Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
c10095 +++$+++ I don't watch the new ones.
c10095 +++$+++ That's exactly why I don't watch 'em anymore -- it's bullshit! Why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid?
c03718 +++$+++ Wants to fix up her makeup, no doubt.
c03718 +++$+++ Is Looseleaf Harper alive?
c03718 +++$+++ Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
c03718 +++$+++ She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
c03718 +++$+++ Why don't you go to bed--son.
c03718 +++$+++ I can't take my eyes off you.
c03718 +++$+++ Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
c03718 +++$+++ Can't it keep till morning?
c03718 +++$+++ She said you were legendary.  I wrote a theme about you, and she said, "Your father is a legendary hero out of the Golden Age of Heroes."
c03718 +++$+++ That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
c03718 +++$+++ Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
c03718 +++$+++ Penelope!
c03718 +++$+++ She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
c03718 +++$+++ Penelope!
c03718 +++$+++ She was on her way home from a meeting of the African Violet Society, and they got her.
c03718 +++$+++ Will you go to bed?
c03718 +++$+++ Scat!
c02140 +++$+++ You use two alternating, don't you?
c02140 +++$+++ We do.
c02140 +++$+++ They've been tested.
c00676 +++$+++ The next corner we can get a cab.
c00676 +++$+++ I should be committed.
c00676 +++$+++ I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
c25619 +++$+++ Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
c25619 +++$+++ A headache?
c25619 +++$+++ Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
c25619 +++$+++ I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
c25619 +++$+++ Okay.
c05616 +++$+++ Is Alyssa home?
c05616 +++$+++ She's out with a friend.
c05616 +++$+++ Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
c05616 +++$+++ Oh...okay.
c23920 +++$+++ Profile's wrong... there.
c23920 +++$+++ No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
c23920 +++$+++ Hey, check it.
c25851 +++$+++ Mattie.  What about this?
c25851 +++$+++ I need it.
c25851 +++$+++ 'Least you admit it.
c25851 +++$+++ Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
c25851 +++$+++ You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
c19639 +++$+++ Switch?!  That is your plan?  It is ludicrous!
c19639 +++$+++ I have it all worked out.
c19639 +++$+++ Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
c19639 +++$+++ Those can be adopted --
c19639 +++$+++ And people close to him, who --
c19639 +++$+++ Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
c19639 +++$+++ Yes, and he has a choice!
c27445 +++$+++ Dr. Fronkonsteen -- look!
c27445 +++$+++ Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
c27445 +++$+++ All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
c24841 +++$+++ I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
c24841 +++$+++ Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
c24841 +++$+++ As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
c24841 +++$+++ I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split.  Maybe he was Gordon's <u>pusher</u>.
c23287 +++$+++ But I'm fearful!
c23287 +++$+++ SING!
c23287 +++$+++ And I'm tearful!
c23287 +++$+++ YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE
c26778 +++$+++ You embarrassed me in front of the highest--ranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
c26778 +++$+++ The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
c26778 +++$+++ Of the six prison inmates you've tested ---- all of whom have had at least some military or survival training --- only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
c26778 +++$+++ I'm still making adjustments...
c26778 +++$+++ You've had a year--and--a--half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
c26778 +++$+++ I'M WHAT?!
c26778 +++$+++ I understand... I understand perfectly.
c25221 +++$+++ What are they for?
c25221 +++$+++ They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
c25221 +++$+++ Of course, that's what they're for.
c22583 +++$+++ Why are they singing, Mama?
c22583 +++$+++ They are singing for me.
c22583 +++$+++ Yes. We will light the candles.
c26786 +++$+++ He was re--enacting Charles Manson's LaBianca murders.
c26786 +++$+++ Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
c26786 +++$+++ Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better ---- to improve upon what was already done.
c26786 +++$+++ Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
c26786 +++$+++ I know who would know.
c13938 +++$+++ Yeah... where are you taking her now?
c13938 +++$+++ Back to Mexico.
c13938 +++$+++ You can't go by train. Escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
c13938 +++$+++ How about a plane?
c13938 +++$+++ That's worse... Just get out of here. Walk out, leave everything.
c13938 +++$+++ I have to go home and get my things.
c13938 +++$+++ I'll take care of it.
c13938 +++$+++ Where can we go?
c13938 +++$+++ ...where does Kyo live?
c13938 +++$+++ With us.
c13938 +++$+++ Okay...
c21327 +++$+++ We gotta face some facts here.
c21327 +++$+++ What facts are those?
c21327 +++$+++ I understand how it could happen.  I know why any guy would love her.  And I can't blame you that it happened.  You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
c21327 +++$+++ I was grieving too.
c21327 +++$+++ Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
c21327 +++$+++ So what are you saying?
c21327 +++$+++ I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
c21327 +++$+++ How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
c09682 +++$+++ I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here.
c09682 +++$+++ Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
c09682 +++$+++ No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
c09682 +++$+++ Why, Mrs. Brenner?
c09682 +++$+++ Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
c09682 +++$+++ Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
c09682 +++$+++ Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
c09682 +++$+++ And if you don't?
c09682 +++$+++ Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
c09682 +++$+++ I think it might also matter to Mitch.
c09682 +++$+++ Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
c09682 +++$+++ Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
c09682 +++$+++ I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
c09682 +++$+++ Would you like me to go for her?
c09682 +++$+++ I couldn't ask you to.
c09682 +++$+++ I don't mind, really.
c09682 +++$+++ I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
c03126 +++$+++ Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
c03126 +++$+++ What're you doing here?
c03126 +++$+++ I wanted to come by, apologize for coming into your house like I did last night.
c03126 +++$+++ Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
c03126 +++$+++ No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
c03126 +++$+++ Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
c03126 +++$+++ Rough day on the set?
c03126 +++$+++ I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons --
c03126 +++$+++ Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
c03126 +++$+++ Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.
c03079 +++$+++ Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
c03079 +++$+++ Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
c03079 +++$+++ I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
c26387 +++$+++ After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
c26387 +++$+++ I'm sorry...
c26387 +++$+++ Yeah.
c24311 +++$+++ Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
c24311 +++$+++ Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
c24311 +++$+++ You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
c25988 +++$+++ Private?
c25988 +++$+++ Yeah.
c25988 +++$+++ How are your grades?
c25988 +++$+++ I'm third in my class.
c25988 +++$+++ What's that mean?
c25988 +++$+++ I get A's.  All A's.
c25988 +++$+++ I'm a National Merit Finalist.  I'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team. I'm in the Spanish Club.  I'm a Thespian.  I'm Vice-President of my class.  I'm on the volleyball team.
c14367 +++$+++ Well, Arletta, I got to stand down here.
c14367 +++$+++ I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
c14367 +++$+++ Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
c14367 +++$+++ Smokin' it up here, Boss.
c26218 +++$+++ That Vietnam movie?
c26218 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c26218 +++$+++ That was a good fuckin' movie.
c26218 +++$+++ Sure was.
c26218 +++$+++ I believe he believes him.
c13774 +++$+++ I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
c13774 +++$+++ How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
c13774 +++$+++ I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
c13774 +++$+++ Had either of them broken up with someone recently? Hurt someone?
c13774 +++$+++ No. Those two were together before Kenny and I started hanging out and that's over, what, God a year now.
c13774 +++$+++ I will. Is that all?
c10576 +++$+++ Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
c10576 +++$+++ Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
c10576 +++$+++ I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
c10576 +++$+++ Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
c10576 +++$+++ Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
c10576 +++$+++ That bastard Pucinski...
c10576 +++$+++ Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
c10576 +++$+++ Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
c10576 +++$+++ Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
c10576 +++$+++ All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
c10576 +++$+++ Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
c10576 +++$+++ This 'bout the fifth time?
c15818 +++$+++ What kind of chromium is it?
c15818 +++$+++ There's more than one kind?
c15818 +++$+++ Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
c15818 +++$+++ With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
c26829 +++$+++ The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
c26829 +++$+++ CAIN, MOUTHING ALONG, WITH THE SPEECH, SHE LOOKS DOWN, AND WE SEE WRITTEN, ON HER COPY. of his making
c26829 +++$+++ AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
c26829 +++$+++ ON CAIN, AS SHE LOOKS AROUND.
c16746 +++$+++ What's this?
c16746 +++$+++ Your bed.
c16746 +++$+++ Have you ever made love in a hammock?
c11175 +++$+++ And what is your occupation, Mr. McCord?
c11175 +++$+++ Security consultant.
c11175 +++$+++ Where?
c11175 +++$+++ Government. Recently retired.
c11175 +++$+++ Where in government?
c11175 +++$+++ ...Central... Intelligence... Agency...
c11175 +++$+++ The C.I.A.
c23830 +++$+++ Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
c23830 +++$+++ She's not gonna know.
c23830 +++$+++ If the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
c22743 +++$+++ Okay, I'll give here the message.
c22743 +++$+++ Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
c22743 +++$+++ What?
c22743 +++$+++ She's really pretty great, isn't she?
c22743 +++$+++ Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
c22743 +++$+++ Jim Court... no, this is her father.  I'll take...
c24495 +++$+++ "They?"
c24495 +++$+++ Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
c24495 +++$+++ What else could I do?
c24495 +++$+++ Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
c24495 +++$+++ Lois, someday --
c24495 +++$+++ I like worrying about you.
c18506 +++$+++ Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
c18506 +++$+++ Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
c18506 +++$+++ Old college graduate now, huh?
c18506 +++$+++ Yep.
c02849 +++$+++ Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
c02849 +++$+++ A... week?
c02849 +++$+++ We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
c02849 +++$+++ Is that your diagnosis?
c02849 +++$+++ Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
c02849 +++$+++ You've been going round-the-clock?
c02849 +++$+++ We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
c02849 +++$+++ Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
c25054 +++$+++ He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
c25054 +++$+++ I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
c25054 +++$+++ It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
c25054 +++$+++ If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
c25054 +++$+++ I do it all the time!
c25054 +++$+++ Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
c25054 +++$+++ I'd be there for him.
c25054 +++$+++ Okay, okay...
c00715 +++$+++ Don't make me laugh, Schultz!
c00715 +++$+++ Dickson doesn't have to go. But he must agree to this merger with New York Trust--
c00715 +++$+++ What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
c08089 +++$+++ What's this?
c08089 +++$+++ It's a scene. Memorize it.
c08089 +++$+++ What?
c08089 +++$+++ A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
c08089 +++$+++ But what is this?
c08089 +++$+++ It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
c08089 +++$+++ What?
c08089 +++$+++ Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
c08089 +++$+++ I gotta memorize all this shit?
c08089 +++$+++ It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
c08089 +++$+++ The things you gotta remember are the details. It's the details that sell your story. Now this story takes place in this men's room. So you gotta know the details about this men's room. You gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. You gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. You gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. And if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.
c11192 +++$+++ Not bad, Chris.
c11192 +++$+++ Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
c11192 +++$+++ Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
c11192 +++$+++ Okay.  I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
c24413 +++$+++ You're alive! She didn't kill you!
c24413 +++$+++ Who didn't?
c24413 +++$+++ That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
c24413 +++$+++ You love me?
c24413 +++$+++ My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
c24413 +++$+++ I know just the place. Hang a left at the Amalgamated Tower.
c08219 +++$+++ You know who I am, August?
c08219 +++$+++ Sure I do.
c08219 +++$+++ Then you know that if I give you a little advice, it'll be good advice.
c08219 +++$+++ Yeah --- sure.
c08219 +++$+++ Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.
c15735 +++$+++ You don't call, you don't write.
c15735 +++$+++ This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
c15735 +++$+++ Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
c15735 +++$+++ We're getting close.
c15735 +++$+++ How close?
c15735 +++$+++ I don't know, but close.
c15735 +++$+++ This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
c15735 +++$+++ You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
c15735 +++$+++ Don't overestimate yourself.
c15735 +++$+++ Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
c15735 +++$+++ I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
c08897 +++$+++ Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
c08897 +++$+++ Why would you want to leave?
c08897 +++$+++ Can I?
c08897 +++$+++ Yes, where would you go?
c08897 +++$+++ I told you, time has no meaning here. If you leave, you can go anywhere, any time.
c23294 +++$+++ Oh, girls.
c23294 +++$+++ Yes, Betty?
c23294 +++$+++ This prom is a real drag.
c23294 +++$+++ Oh-huh.
c23294 +++$+++ Oh my!
c23294 +++$+++ What is it, Betty?
c23294 +++$+++ Look at that.  Get a gander.
c23294 +++$+++ Oh my!
c23294 +++$+++ He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
c23294 +++$+++ Yes, Betty?
c23294 +++$+++ HE'S SO FINE.
c23294 +++$+++ WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
c14339 +++$+++ Some kind of circuitry...?
c14339 +++$+++ Very good, Doctor.  I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
c14339 +++$+++ A machine.  But a machine that does what?
c14339 +++$+++ That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
c14339 +++$+++ In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
c00631 +++$+++ C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
c00631 +++$+++ Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
c00631 +++$+++ Yes!
c22705 +++$+++ I can't give you that.  This guy's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years.  He's been getting it from every end.  I'd love to hear his story.
c22705 +++$+++ One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
c22705 +++$+++ One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
c22705 +++$+++ I can accept that.
c22705 +++$+++ And I want to turn the home over to the state.
c22705 +++$+++ He'd like to start serving immediately.
c22705 +++$+++ I can put that together.
c22705 +++$+++ Confirm this with my office and my client.
c22705 +++$+++ Alright.
c10587 +++$+++ ...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South.
c10587 +++$+++ You tell the boy who knocked you up?
c10587 +++$+++ It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
c10587 +++$+++ What happened to him?
c10587 +++$+++ Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
c10587 +++$+++ Dell disappeared. Dell was learnin' a hard lesson. What I learned from observin' Dell is I think people who are frightened want to disappear. He'd startin' behavin' weird? Like comin' up to people every fifteen minutes and askin' how they were doin'?
c11678 +++$+++ You wanna dance?
c11678 +++$+++ I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
c11678 +++$+++ No...  ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
c18970 +++$+++ No.  But I've been to Brooklyn.
c18970 +++$+++ I see you have people there. What are their names?
c18970 +++$+++ That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
c18970 +++$+++ What about your mommy?
c18970 +++$+++ Do you like to be with your mommy?
c15035 +++$+++ Need help?
c15035 +++$+++ I got it.  I got it.
c15035 +++$+++ You sure?  I can help you.
c15035 +++$+++ Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
c15035 +++$+++ Go in the house.
c04635 +++$+++ Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
c04635 +++$+++ Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
c04635 +++$+++ It would be better if he called us.
c04635 +++$+++ Yeah.
c04635 +++$+++ Okay. Thank you.
c21190 +++$+++ --It started as a favor-- for my brother-- you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no-- a favor-- Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but-- Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it-- stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away-- and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.
c21190 +++$+++ What are you going to do?
c21190 +++$+++ About Edie?
c21190 +++$+++ Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
c21190 +++$+++ It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
c21190 +++$+++ A question of who rides who.
c21190 +++$+++ If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
c21190 +++$+++ How much is your soul worth if you don't?
c21190 +++$+++ But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger-- and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
c21190 +++$+++ Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers-- and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you--  -- Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
c21190 +++$+++ Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
c21190 +++$+++ Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?
c23244 +++$+++ It's so pretty.
c23244 +++$+++ Yeah.
c23244 +++$+++ No.
c01581 +++$+++ What did you wish for, Adam?
c01581 +++$+++ If he tells, it won't come true!
c01581 +++$+++ Well, we did in my family!
c00362 +++$+++ Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
c00362 +++$+++ Anything ---
c00362 +++$+++ What about time...?
c01249 +++$+++ Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
c01249 +++$+++ Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
c01249 +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
c01249 +++$+++ I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink.  Your chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is a considerable expert.
c06596 +++$+++ Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
c06596 +++$+++ You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
c06596 +++$+++ Oh - uh - nothing.
c06463 +++$+++ Strategy.
c06463 +++$+++ Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
c06463 +++$+++ The Big Picture.
c06463 +++$+++ So change it.
c14315 +++$+++ We've lost contact.
c14315 +++$+++ Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
c14315 +++$+++ There's no plug to pull.
c14315 +++$+++ There is no abort procedure -- we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.
c03003 +++$+++ No, wait, are you-
c03003 +++$+++ Lt. Madison, GO.
c03003 +++$+++ GO Commander.
c22968 +++$+++ Somethin' mighty fishy about this trail, Uncle Ethan...
c22968 +++$+++ Stop callin' me 'uncle'...I ain't your uncle.
c22968 +++$+++ Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
c04857 +++$+++ These new people never identified themselves.  They musta been watching the whole thing 'cause they knew everything Mary and me had been doing that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard to find - wearing that red raincoat.
c04857 +++$+++ How many shots you say you heard?
c04857 +++$+++ Four to six.
c04857 +++$+++ That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
c04857 +++$+++ ...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
c04857 +++$+++ No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
c04857 +++$+++ I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, but it sure felt like two and two was coming up three... and then they took Mary's five snapshots from me, sent them to Washington, and when they returned them weeks later, two of them had the backgrounds mutilated... The only one we saved was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want to go to Washington when the Warren Commission subpoenaed me... so the lawyer come down here and interviewed me at Parkland Hospital.
c18675 +++$+++ We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?
c18675 +++$+++ We don't write up anything until we're done....
c18675 +++$+++ Okay.. .we're done, man....
c18675 +++$+++ When we got the grant....
c18675 +++$+++ When I got the grant.....
c18675 +++$+++ When I signed on....
c18675 +++$+++ When I invited you...
c18675 +++$+++ We got it together, Jake....
c18675 +++$+++ Okay...we got it together....
c18675 +++$+++ We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
c18675 +++$+++ We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
c18675 +++$+++ The shark will get it for us.
c17767 +++$+++ Hold up a minute...
c17767 +++$+++ You spend the afternoon in Bed?
c17767 +++$+++ First things first.
c17767 +++$+++ That's why my wife adores me.
c05979 +++$+++ What?
c05979 +++$+++ Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
c05979 +++$+++ Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
c05979 +++$+++ Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
c05979 +++$+++ Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
c17824 +++$+++ Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  Several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  I have to ask if you've placed those bids.
c17824 +++$+++ Because?
c17824 +++$+++ Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
c17824 +++$+++ And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
c17824 +++$+++ Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere....
c08723 +++$+++ What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
c08723 +++$+++ I can trust Rheya.
c08723 +++$+++ You'll end up like me.
c08723 +++$+++ You're not Gibarian...
c08723 +++$+++ No?  Who am I, then?
c08723 +++$+++ And you're not?  Maybe you're my puppet.  But like all puppets, you think you're actually human.  It's The Puppet's Dream.  Wondering if they're human!
c20492 +++$+++ What are you DOING here ?
c20492 +++$+++ I work here, remember ?
c20492 +++$+++ That was eleven years ago.
c20492 +++$+++ Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
c20492 +++$+++ Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
c20492 +++$+++ That's a shame.
c20492 +++$+++ Yeah a real shame.
c20492 +++$+++ Bye....
c04863 +++$+++ Let me show you his picture.
c04863 +++$+++ No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
c04863 +++$+++ Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
c04863 +++$+++ Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I believe there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the man you had in mind?
c04863 +++$+++ One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
c10067 +++$+++ Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
c10067 +++$+++ Deco.
c10067 +++$+++ Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
c10067 +++$+++ That...? Vestibule.
c10067 +++$+++ When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
c07888 +++$+++ Where you been all day?
c07888 +++$+++ I took the kids to my sister's.
c07888 +++$+++ I called. You weren't there.
c07888 +++$+++ I got bored so I went to the movies.
c07888 +++$+++ What'd you see?
c07888 +++$+++ I went to the movies.
c07888 +++$+++ What'd you see?
c07888 +++$+++ "Father of the Bride."
c07888 +++$+++ What was it about?
c07888 +++$+++ Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
c07888 +++$+++ Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
c07888 +++$+++ What're you talking about?
c07888 +++$+++ Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
c07888 +++$+++ What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
c23386 +++$+++ These dang things are heavy. Hard to carry, too.
c23386 +++$+++ What you got in there, warshing?
c23386 +++$+++ Yeah.
c23386 +++$+++ Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
c23386 +++$+++ I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
c23386 +++$+++ How fer you going with them sacks full of warsh?
c23386 +++$+++ About a half a mile I think it is.
c23386 +++$+++ Okay. You don't have to though.
c12732 +++$+++ Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.
c12732 +++$+++ Yeah.
c12732 +++$+++ I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.
c24995 +++$+++ And the last thing I'd ever do is lie to you.  Think about it, Truman, if everybody's in on it, I'd have to be in on it too. I'm not in on it, because there is no <i>it.</i>
c24995 +++$+++ So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
c24995 +++$+++ Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
c24995 +++$+++ The thing that started all of this.
c17465 +++$+++ Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
c17465 +++$+++ Like heroin?
c17465 +++$+++ Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
c17465 +++$+++ Could be. The physical substance of love.
c12308 +++$+++ Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
c12308 +++$+++ No.
c12308 +++$+++ How were you compensated for these duties you say you performed?
c12308 +++$+++ Compensated...?
c12308 +++$+++ I was given meals, and a home...
c21850 +++$+++ Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
c21850 +++$+++ You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
c21850 +++$+++ You're going to jump on me.
c21850 +++$+++ You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
c21850 +++$+++ What???
c21850 +++$+++ Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
c21850 +++$+++ Aaaaaaaaaa!
c13914 +++$+++ I don't like the word 'cheat.'
c13914 +++$+++ Did you have affairs?
c13914 +++$+++ Mr. Gittes.
c13914 +++$+++ Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
c05440 +++$+++ What did they ask?
c05440 +++$+++ If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
c05440 +++$+++ I asked the officers if you had committed some crime... If they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
c15750 +++$+++ Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
c15750 +++$+++ That's because I wanted them to!
c15750 +++$+++ I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
c15750 +++$+++ I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
c15750 +++$+++ You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
c18358 +++$+++ I'm thinking of going back to school.
c18358 +++$+++ Social work?
c18358 +++$+++ How'd you know?
c18358 +++$+++ Educated guess.
c18358 +++$+++ You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
c15403 +++$+++ Did you see that?
c15403 +++$+++ What?
c15403 +++$+++ Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
c15403 +++$+++ Okay, I'm nuts.
c03636 +++$+++ The tap. What you do for a living.
c03636 +++$+++ I'm a salesman.
c03636 +++$+++ You're on the grift. Same as me.
c03636 +++$+++ Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square.
c18543 +++$+++ I thought you said she was going with us?
c18543 +++$+++ Let's just go sailing, okay?
c18543 +++$+++ Want to swim home?
c05139 +++$+++ Hey Junebug, when all this is over we should get the band back together again.
c05139 +++$+++ Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
c05139 +++$+++ Were we together?
c22395 +++$+++ Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
c22395 +++$+++ He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
c22395 +++$+++ He'll be back soon.
c22395 +++$+++ Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.
c16831 +++$+++ Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
c16831 +++$+++ It's your best play, Nicky.
c16831 +++$+++ See, Daddy.
c16831 +++$+++ I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
c16831 +++$+++ An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
c06804 +++$+++ I haven't been there for three years.
c06804 +++$+++ I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
c06804 +++$+++ No, they're living in Nice now.
c06804 +++$+++ That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
c06804 +++$+++ Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
c06804 +++$+++ You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
c06804 +++$+++ I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
c05907 +++$+++ ... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which I assure you I have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
c05907 +++$+++ Your supervisors have no idea why you're here.
c05907 +++$+++ They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
c08325 +++$+++ Hello.
c08325 +++$+++ Cynthia. John.
c08325 +++$+++ Not today. I've got other plans.
c08325 +++$+++ Oh.  Well, when, then?
c08325 +++$+++ How about inviting me over to dinner?
c08325 +++$+++ Yeah, I know what you mean.
c19533 +++$+++ What do you want?
c19533 +++$+++ Came by to check on you.
c19533 +++$+++ After five years.
c19533 +++$+++ Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
c19533 +++$+++ Look, I'm busy.
c19533 +++$+++ I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
c19533 +++$+++ I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
c19533 +++$+++ No.
c19533 +++$+++ Good.
c19533 +++$+++ Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
c19533 +++$+++ And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
c19533 +++$+++ You want me to fuck off?
c19533 +++$+++ Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
c14249 +++$+++ ...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
c14249 +++$+++ I never learned jazz.
c14249 +++$+++ God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
c14249 +++$+++ That what we're doing?  Flowing?
c14249 +++$+++ Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
c14249 +++$+++ That's the point.  You play <u>between</u> the notes, you dance <u>around</u> the structure, you improvise.  Some people know where they're going to be ten years from now.  Same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over.  That's not living.  That's dying a little every day.  Not me, pal.  It's not knowing what's around the corner that makes like worth living.  That's jazz.  That guy up there, he knows what I'm talking about.  Hell, it's the same thing <u>he's</u> talking about, if you just open your ears.  You can hear it in the conversation he's having with that trumpet...
c13979 +++$+++ Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
c13979 +++$+++ I didn't see that.
c13979 +++$+++ It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
c13979 +++$+++ Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice.
c17636 +++$+++ Fancy.
c17636 +++$+++ This has not been my night. My clothes are in the wash, I spilled butter down the front of me, I got stuck in a window...
c17636 +++$+++ I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
c17636 +++$+++ I can't.
c17636 +++$+++ He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
c23823 +++$+++ How much damage?
c23823 +++$+++ To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
c23823 +++$+++ I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm just stating the facts.  The outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  The necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
c07563 +++$+++ Do you like them?
c07563 +++$+++ Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
c07563 +++$+++ You wear them of course, silly.
c07563 +++$+++ Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
c07563 +++$+++ I know that.
c07563 +++$+++ Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
c07563 +++$+++ Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
c13682 +++$+++ See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
c13682 +++$+++ Thought you liked me, bitch.
c13682 +++$+++ Nice lady.
c18807 +++$+++ I could come with you.
c18807 +++$+++ Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
c18807 +++$+++ I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
c18807 +++$+++ You like to have kids, you just don't want to be with them, do you?
c26910 +++$+++ I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
c26910 +++$+++ Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
c26910 +++$+++ I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.
c23925 +++$+++ She's flying starships !
c23925 +++$+++ Who ?
c23925 +++$+++ I have good reflexes.
c04431 +++$+++ When?
c04431 +++$+++ This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
c04431 +++$+++ I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
c04739 +++$+++ I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
c04739 +++$+++ And this is what you want--thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
c04739 +++$+++ Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
c04739 +++$+++ Yes, I know--but--
c04739 +++$+++ What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
c04739 +++$+++ Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
c04739 +++$+++ What ten thousand?
c04739 +++$+++ The reward.
c04739 +++$+++ Who said anything about a reward!
c04739 +++$+++ I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for--
c04739 +++$+++ All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
c04739 +++$+++ You're a peculiar chap.
c04739 +++$+++ We'll go into that some other time.
c04739 +++$+++ The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to--
c04739 +++$+++ Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
c04739 +++$+++ Yeah--with all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?
c12273 +++$+++ What is that?
c12273 +++$+++ Our greenhouse.
c12273 +++$+++ Yes, so do we.
c14304 +++$+++ Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program.  Are you familiar with it?
c14304 +++$+++ It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
c14304 +++$+++ A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
c14304 +++$+++ Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
c14304 +++$+++ M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
c14304 +++$+++ I am impressed.  We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
c23017 +++$+++ Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
c23017 +++$+++ I am not so well-born.
c23017 +++$+++ Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
c23017 +++$+++ All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
c23017 +++$+++ Like Valentine and Silvia?
c23017 +++$+++ No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
c23017 +++$+++ But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
c08176 +++$+++ Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
c08176 +++$+++ This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
c08176 +++$+++ The ghost is close. He almost got us. Buddy is hurt.
c08176 +++$+++ Right behind you.
c00590 +++$+++ I see that you're expecting.
c00590 +++$+++ Oh, yes.
c00590 +++$+++ In three months! Papa.
c19862 +++$+++ See if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
c19862 +++$+++ Anything specific?
c19862 +++$+++ You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
c19862 +++$+++ Don't ask.
c20995 +++$+++ Can I just say, I thought 'Ghost' was a wonderful film.
c20995 +++$+++ Is that right?
c20995 +++$+++ Yes... I've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life.
c20995 +++$+++ I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
c20995 +++$+++ Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
c19749 +++$+++ Did the girl die?
c19749 +++$+++ No.
c19749 +++$+++ She got all right?
c19749 +++$+++ ...after a while.
c19749 +++$+++ ...yes.
c02701 +++$+++ Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
c02701 +++$+++ Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
c02701 +++$+++ Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
c16538 +++$+++ You know, just after I came back off tour with the Betenthaller Quartet, Dad, myself and Herbert had a summit conference about you...
c16538 +++$+++ Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
c16538 +++$+++ I don't know where you were, penis envy.
c16538 +++$+++ At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, "What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that...
c10747 +++$+++ What?
c10747 +++$+++ Would you like to sit on my lap?
c10747 +++$+++ No thank you.
c10747 +++$+++ Are you sure?
c10747 +++$+++ I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
c10747 +++$+++ Do you want me to sit on your lap?
c13564 +++$+++ Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
c13564 +++$+++ He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
c13564 +++$+++ Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
c13564 +++$+++ You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
c13564 +++$+++ We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
c13564 +++$+++ Do you have to point that?
c13564 +++$+++ Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
c13564 +++$+++ He seems to be headed for Topanga.
c13564 +++$+++ I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
c13564 +++$+++ The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
c13564 +++$+++ Granted, the cops are not an alternative.  Certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
c13564 +++$+++ I don't hear him moving around anymore.
c13564 +++$+++ Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
c13564 +++$+++ A typical fuck-up.
c13564 +++$+++ What's that supposed to me?
c13564 +++$+++ I knew you were a loser the first night I laid eyes on you.
c13564 +++$+++ You, I would've noticed.
c13564 +++$+++ Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
c13564 +++$+++ You were at the Emerald that night?
c13564 +++$+++ Naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
c13564 +++$+++ I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
c13564 +++$+++ You're enjoying this too much.
c21588 +++$+++ Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
c21588 +++$+++ I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
c21588 +++$+++ You probably know the type. You find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. They always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. They dress and enamel themselves with great care. They worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. And they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like Larry Mitchell.  Tell me about yourself, Miss Mayfield.
c21588 +++$+++ I was born in New York City. I grew up. And here I am.
c21588 +++$+++ I'll have to know a little more than that.
c21588 +++$+++ Miss Mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. Within 24 hours I shall know officially whether Mitchell was murdered. Privately, I'm quite sure of it now. It happened in your room, and you came to Vancouver with him.. At any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. And you arrived together. Here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  A few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. Would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
c18221 +++$+++ I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
c18221 +++$+++ And he still sits there?
c18221 +++$+++ Every day.
c18221 +++$+++ No.  He knows it won't.  It was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.
c23783 +++$+++ Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
c23783 +++$+++ Who wants to know?  Zeus!
c23783 +++$+++ I'm sick of you people. Why don't you leave him be?
c13273 +++$+++ I was a slave.
c13273 +++$+++ In Virginia.
c13273 +++$+++ I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
c13273 +++$+++ Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.
c21219 +++$+++ I've got the ropes loose now. I've got my hands free.  Be careful--Don't change your expression too much.  They must not catch on.
c21219 +++$+++ What can we do against them?
c21219 +++$+++ I don't know, yet.  We'll just have to watch our chance. When it comes I'll know what to do--I hope I'll know what to do.
c21219 +++$+++ I still don't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you.
c21219 +++$+++ All right.  Put it on heavy.
c21219 +++$+++ My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
c21219 +++$+++ Maybe so.
c03324 +++$+++ So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
c03324 +++$+++ I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
c03324 +++$+++ Does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
c03324 +++$+++ For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
c03324 +++$+++ All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
c03324 +++$+++ Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
c03324 +++$+++ I'm not even good for me.
c03324 +++$+++ Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
c03324 +++$+++ Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
c03324 +++$+++ Let me jingle you right now.
c02768 +++$+++ Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
c02768 +++$+++ You think I'd miss it?
c02768 +++$+++ Well? What'd you think?
c02768 +++$+++ I just wanted to see how you looked.
c02768 +++$+++ How'd I look?
c02768 +++$+++ Enh.
c02768 +++$+++ You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
c09452 +++$+++ Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
c09452 +++$+++ Not so perfectly if you noticed.
c09452 +++$+++ Mike, why am I out?
c09452 +++$+++ OK, but then I agree with Tessio. You're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the Corleones...
c18119 +++$+++ Where are my supplies?
c18119 +++$+++ I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
c18119 +++$+++ No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
c24557 +++$+++ Well...flashlight?
c24557 +++$+++ I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
c24557 +++$+++ If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
c24557 +++$+++ Not exactly. He's kind of a rewrite man. Actually, he's a bit dull, if you know what I mean.
c17671 +++$+++ Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
c17671 +++$+++ Yeah?
c17671 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c08579 +++$+++ No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
c08579 +++$+++ Good.
c08579 +++$+++ Is Miss Simone coming today?
c08579 +++$+++ She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
c08579 +++$+++ Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
c13784 +++$+++ Can you describe her? How old was she?
c13784 +++$+++ I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
c13784 +++$+++ Can you get inside?
c13784 +++$+++ I can.
c13784 +++$+++ I don't give a fuck what your reasons are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside Otherwise, get a warrant.
c00422 +++$+++ Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
c00422 +++$+++ Sleeping.
c00422 +++$+++ You remember Margie Fogg?
c00422 +++$+++ From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
c00422 +++$+++ How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
c00422 +++$+++ Yeah.
c05860 +++$+++ --then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
c05860 +++$+++ I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
c05860 +++$+++ They were in a quandary, and--
c05860 +++$+++ Come on, Lovey.
c05860 +++$+++ In a quandary.
c00071 +++$+++ To bring the word of God.
c00071 +++$+++ Chief says -- he has a God.
c00071 +++$+++ ... and also to bring medicine.
c00071 +++$+++ He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
c20383 +++$+++ Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
c20383 +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, I did.
c20383 +++$+++ Good man.  And is she all right?
c20383 +++$+++ Yeah.
c20383 +++$+++ Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
c20383 +++$+++ Are you all right, Barney?
c14679 +++$+++ Fuck her yet?
c14679 +++$+++ I'm working on it.
c14679 +++$+++ Loser.
c14679 +++$+++ Blow me.
c14679 +++$+++ Okay.
c21473 +++$+++ ... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did <u>any</u> of them know Andy was sick? <u>How</u> did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street?
c21473 +++$+++ Jesus.
c21473 +++$+++ What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
c21473 +++$+++ Charles...
c21473 +++$+++ Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us.
c05685 +++$+++ Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
c05685 +++$+++ Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
c05685 +++$+++ What'd you say?
c00902 +++$+++ You look beautiful.
c00902 +++$+++ Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
c00902 +++$+++ I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
c14963 +++$+++ So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
c14963 +++$+++ That's what I do.
c14963 +++$+++ Seen a lot of islands?
c14963 +++$+++ Quite a few.
c14963 +++$+++ Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
c14963 +++$+++ Anti social?
c14963 +++$+++ Self sufficient...
c14963 +++$+++ Takes one to know one.
c25147 +++$+++ Why did you come tonight? To see me?
c25147 +++$+++ To hear them read Torah.
c25147 +++$+++ I thought you hated Torah.
c25147 +++$+++ Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
c23326 +++$+++ Hey -- your prayers have been answered. I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.
c23326 +++$+++ Really.  Well, that makes two of us.
c23326 +++$+++ What?
c23326 +++$+++ I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
c23326 +++$+++ But -- why?
c23326 +++$+++ I must go where I can be of use.
c23326 +++$+++ But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
c23326 +++$+++ Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
c23326 +++$+++ A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  You have raised the Sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  They imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
c07984 +++$+++ You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
c07984 +++$+++ My gun?
c07984 +++$+++ In your pocket.  Give it to me.
c07984 +++$+++ You trust me, don't you?  Just give it to me for a second.
c11459 +++$+++ Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
c11459 +++$+++ Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
c11459 +++$+++ But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
c11459 +++$+++ Look around, sweetheart.
c05179 +++$+++ Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
c05179 +++$+++ Nothing...
c05179 +++$+++ I went to the doctor today.
c19304 +++$+++ Mom?
c19304 +++$+++ Yeah?
c19304 +++$+++ For a while.
c15346 +++$+++ Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
c15346 +++$+++ Ed, it was only one review.
c15346 +++$+++ Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
c15346 +++$+++ I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get...
c03456 +++$+++ Mrs. Robinson?
c03456 +++$+++ I'm in the bathroom.
c03456 +++$+++ Well here's the purse.
c03456 +++$+++ Well I'll hand it to you.
c16417 +++$+++ Are you Jorge Cruz?
c16417 +++$+++ Maybe.  What's this about?
c16417 +++$+++ No.  What's this about?
c16745 +++$+++ Hey Deb... can you hear me?
c16745 +++$+++ Barely.
c16745 +++$+++ What?
c22082 +++$+++ It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
c22082 +++$+++ You can't be serious.
c22082 +++$+++ We've been chasing this deal six months, and now you're gonna chuck it out the window?
c26008 +++$+++ It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
c26008 +++$+++ We agree.
c26008 +++$+++ So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
c26008 +++$+++ This is a very different proposition.
c10786 +++$+++ You know, this is crazy.
c10786 +++$+++ What?
c10786 +++$+++ Being here, with me.
c10786 +++$+++ I know.
c10786 +++$+++ Most people say the odds are against me.
c10786 +++$+++ The percentages --
c16985 +++$+++ Said he'd heard you were up in town. Wondered if I knew where you was staying. Wanted to look you up. Old time's sake.
c16985 +++$+++ That's nice. What'd you tell him?
c16985 +++$+++ Good lad.
c01463 +++$+++ He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
c01463 +++$+++ Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
c01463 +++$+++ He could?
c01463 +++$+++ His company made us.
c01463 +++$+++ I'd be happy to mention it to him.
c01463 +++$+++ Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
c01463 +++$+++ No.
c01463 +++$+++ This afternoon.
c16594 +++$+++ I'm still here.
c16594 +++$+++ I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
c16594 +++$+++ Wouldn't they normally be locked?
c16594 +++$+++ Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
c16594 +++$+++ I have the same problem with my help.
c16594 +++$+++ I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
c16594 +++$+++ In this drawer....
c02113 +++$+++ Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
c02113 +++$+++ Never. Why do you ask?
c02113 +++$+++ I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
c02113 +++$+++ Gambling's not about money.
c02113 +++$+++ Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
c10624 +++$+++ I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
c10624 +++$+++ I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
c10624 +++$+++ HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
c06218 +++$+++ I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
c06218 +++$+++ I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
c06218 +++$+++ I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
c06218 +++$+++ That's nice.
c05912 +++$+++ I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
c05912 +++$+++ It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
c05912 +++$+++ This is a college?  I'm sorry, I thought it was a carnival.
c14481 +++$+++ Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
c14481 +++$+++ Letty.
c14481 +++$+++ First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
c14481 +++$+++ I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night.
c08759 +++$+++ A recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
c08759 +++$+++ And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
c08759 +++$+++ Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
c19175 +++$+++ The honors of war?
c19175 +++$+++ Granted.
c19175 +++$+++ My colors?
c19175 +++$+++ Allow me to consult with my officers.
c01360 +++$+++ Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
c01360 +++$+++ He will come back.
c01360 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c01360 +++$+++ He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
c01360 +++$+++ No. But you tend to tie them up.
c01824 +++$+++ I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
c01824 +++$+++ That's where we came out.
c01824 +++$+++ It's a lot of money, Pam.
c01824 +++$+++ We're talking raw, unprocessed KGB files. It's not something we can go out and comparison shop.
c01824 +++$+++ For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
c18217 +++$+++ Joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  You're stronger than you think.
c18217 +++$+++ Then tell me what to do.
c18217 +++$+++ This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
c18217 +++$+++ Your apartment.
c25857 +++$+++ Get down, boy.
c25857 +++$+++ Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
c25857 +++$+++ What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
c25857 +++$+++ Morg, use your head.
c25857 +++$+++ I am usin' it, Wyatt.  Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle.  You know they hit Clum's house, too?  Shot up his wife. His wife.  Who ever heard of That?  Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women?  They're bugs, Wyatt.  You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live?  Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
c25857 +++$+++ Listen to yourself, Wyatt.  Lie Down and crawl or you might get Hurt?  What kinda talk is that? That's Virgil lyin' over there, Wyatt.  Our own brother.  Ruined For life.  No sir, I ain't going No place.  You want to go, fine. I'm stayin' right here and have It out with those bastards.
c02767 +++$+++ Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
c02767 +++$+++ Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
c02767 +++$+++ I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
c02767 +++$+++ Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
c02767 +++$+++ Harry.
c02738 +++$+++ Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
c02738 +++$+++ Who's this?
c02738 +++$+++ Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month option.
c02738 +++$+++ Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
c02738 +++$+++ Very fine bone structure.
c22573 +++$+++ Hi.
c22573 +++$+++ Hi.  Sam?
c22573 +++$+++ You must be Jonah.
c09185 +++$+++ You have one with two beds?
c09185 +++$+++ Sure.
c09185 +++$+++ I'll take that.
c09185 +++$+++ Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?
c09185 +++$+++ Credit card.
c09185 +++$+++ I'll have to run your card off now.
c09185 +++$+++ It's still the full price.
c03799 +++$+++ No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
c03799 +++$+++ Are you going to stiff me?
c03799 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c03799 +++$+++ Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
c03799 +++$+++ You want a tip?
c03799 +++$+++ Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
c03799 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c03799 +++$+++ I'll give you a tip. Here's forty dollars.
c11187 +++$+++ Good work, Ostreicher.
c11187 +++$+++ Thanks coach.
c11187 +++$+++ -- Thanks, coach --
c22982 +++$+++ She'd be about thirteen now...
c22982 +++$+++ We got two around that age...
c22982 +++$+++ Where?
c22982 +++$+++ You'll have to wait until we reach the agency...Fall in behind the column...
c22982 +++$+++ Sorry...  Keep the column moving!..Close ranks there!
c08091 +++$+++ How's freedom kid, pretty fuckin' good, ain't it?
c08091 +++$+++ It's a change.
c08091 +++$+++ Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
c08091 +++$+++ Take a seat.
c09376 +++$+++ Hello?
c09376 +++$+++ Hi, Mike?
c09376 +++$+++ Lorraine?
c09376 +++$+++ Are you on the other line?
c09376 +++$+++ Yeah, hold on.
c09376 +++$+++ No, no. Hold on.
c20928 +++$+++ You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
c20928 +++$+++ Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
c20928 +++$+++ Yeah.
c01829 +++$+++ Someone dead from this household?
c01829 +++$+++ We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
c01829 +++$+++ What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
c01829 +++$+++ My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
c01829 +++$+++ They've been sanctified and buried in the holy rites of God's church, and any hand that disturbs them now takes on eternal damnation. So please -- do it.
c05475 +++$+++ Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
c05475 +++$+++ And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
c05475 +++$+++ One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
c10879 +++$+++ Stay away from me...
c10879 +++$+++ Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
c10879 +++$+++ No...
c10879 +++$+++ He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
c10879 +++$+++ Not your fault...
c10879 +++$+++ Agnes who did you see?
c10879 +++$+++ I hate him...
c10879 +++$+++ Of course you do. Who was it?
c10879 +++$+++ I hate him for what he did to me.
c10879 +++$+++ Yes.
c10879 +++$+++ For what he made me go through.
c10879 +++$+++ Who?
c10879 +++$+++ Agnes, who did this to you?
c09314 +++$+++ How do you feel, Agent
c09314 +++$+++ Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
c09314 +++$+++ Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
c09314 +++$+++ He got away. I had him. He got away.
c09314 +++$+++ No, just coincidence. He knew who I was, of course. He had my ID -- did he keep it?
c00104 +++$+++ Where is she?
c00104 +++$+++ Takin' a bath.
c00104 +++$+++ Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
c20005 +++$+++ Me? Why would he be interested in me?
c20005 +++$+++ I told him about your car.
c20005 +++$+++ He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
c20580 +++$+++ They're enormous, I know.
c20580 +++$+++ Is there milk in them already?
c20580 +++$+++ No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
c20580 +++$+++ When did you umm, I mean umm...
c20580 +++$+++ Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
c20580 +++$+++ Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
c20580 +++$+++ You're telling me.
c24835 +++$+++ Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
c24835 +++$+++ I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
c24835 +++$+++ Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
c24835 +++$+++ Then what good is he?
c24835 +++$+++ Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
c24835 +++$+++ Is that a problem?
c24835 +++$+++ Not for you, clearly.
c24835 +++$+++ I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
c24835 +++$+++ Am I a thing?
c24835 +++$+++ Well, you're certainly not a person.
c24835 +++$+++ I'm not.
c24835 +++$+++ No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
c24835 +++$+++ I'm so glad we're having this chat.
c24835 +++$+++ It's not a knock.
c24835 +++$+++ It's not a compliment.
c24835 +++$+++ It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
c24835 +++$+++ As soon as you get dressed.
c24835 +++$+++ What kind of food?
c24835 +++$+++ Anything but Japanese.
c24835 +++$+++ Why?
c24835 +++$+++ I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
c24835 +++$+++ Like you.
c24835 +++$+++ I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine. Buffets.  Salad bars.
c24835 +++$+++ You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
c24835 +++$+++ It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
c24835 +++$+++ For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
c24835 +++$+++ Oh, god.
c20729 +++$+++ How's your stomach?
c20729 +++$+++ Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
c20729 +++$+++ They're looking all over for you. Do you have a copy of the album.
c14463 +++$+++ I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
c14463 +++$+++ Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
c14463 +++$+++ What?
c13390 +++$+++ Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd you do it?
c13390 +++$+++ Well, that's why they paid so well.
c13390 +++$+++ You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
c13390 +++$+++ Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
c13390 +++$+++ Okay. You come by the house?
c13390 +++$+++ I'll come by.
c13390 +++$+++ Seven o'clock.
c08711 +++$+++ ... Jesus... what for?
c08711 +++$+++ -- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
c08711 +++$+++ Wow.
c08711 +++$+++ Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
c08711 +++$+++ Yeah, there's a pair'a broads I'm thinking might be good for this.
c08711 +++$+++ Chances are, they're gonna get into some shit too, hafta put people down.
c08711 +++$+++ That's not a problem. Are we goin' outta pocket ourselves?
c08711 +++$+++ Yeah, I can front this.
c08711 +++$+++ Well just so I got a quote in my head. What's the rate for the Swede?
c08711 +++$+++ That's the punchline, y'ready?
c08711 +++$+++ Shoot.
c08711 +++$+++ A million flat.
c08711 +++$+++ None whatsoever.
c05053 +++$+++ I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
c05053 +++$+++ He did? When?
c05053 +++$+++ While you were in the shower.
c05053 +++$+++ Why didn't you call me?
c05053 +++$+++ He didn't give me a chance.  Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
c05053 +++$+++ What? What do you mean?
c05053 +++$+++ He said you didn't have one.
c05053 +++$+++ What's he talking about?
c05053 +++$+++ I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
c05053 +++$+++ Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight.  Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
c10315 +++$+++ Got any booze in the house?
c10315 +++$+++ You don't drink "booze".
c10315 +++$+++ Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
c17478 +++$+++ You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
c17478 +++$+++ Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
c17478 +++$+++ In Portugal, yes.
c06913 +++$+++ Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
c06913 +++$+++ How do you mean?
c06913 +++$+++ I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
c06913 +++$+++ Say what, Walt Spoon!
c06913 +++$+++ There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
c06913 +++$+++ About what!
c06913 +++$+++ About Mr. Powell. All of it!
c06913 +++$+++ Walt!
c06913 +++$+++ Now, Mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
c06913 +++$+++ Mother, I only --
c19696 +++$+++ What about him?
c19696 +++$+++ I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
c19696 +++$+++ Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now.
c19696 +++$+++ That was Peterson upstairs.
c19696 +++$+++ It was you who did the asking.
c19696 +++$+++ He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
c19696 +++$+++ I wouldn't presume to try.
c19696 +++$+++ You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on-one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic?
c19696 +++$+++ He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.  But I don't think he's psychic.  What he has it empathy and projection.  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
c19696 +++$+++ Why aren't you ever alone with him?
c19696 +++$+++ Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
c19696 +++$+++ His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
c19696 +++$+++ I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
c19696 +++$+++ That's when it happened?
c19696 +++$+++ No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box.  When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy?'  That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown.
c19696 +++$+++ What's the bottom line?
c19696 +++$+++ If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
c19696 +++$+++ I don't recommend it.
c15082 +++$+++ Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
c15082 +++$+++ About what?
c15082 +++$+++ Never!
c25555 +++$+++ Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
c25555 +++$+++ Let's see.  Where's it from?
c25555 +++$+++ Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
c25555 +++$+++ I don't know.
c25555 +++$+++ He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
c25555 +++$+++ Oh take it!  Please take it!
c10771 +++$+++ Very weird.
c10771 +++$+++ No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
c10771 +++$+++ What's weird about that?
c10771 +++$+++ Guess I'm not like most women.
c07507 +++$+++ There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
c07507 +++$+++ The Black Pearl is a real ship.
c07507 +++$+++ No, it's not.
c07507 +++$+++ Yes it is.  I've seen it.
c07507 +++$+++ You've seen it?
c07507 +++$+++ Yes.
c07507 +++$+++ You've seen the Black Pearl?
c07507 +++$+++ Yes.
c07507 +++$+++ You haven't seen it.
c07507 +++$+++ Yes, I have.
c07507 +++$+++ You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out?
c07507 +++$+++ ... No.
c07507 +++$+++ No.
c07507 +++$+++ But I've seen a ship with black sails.
c07507 +++$+++ Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl.  Is that what you're saying?
c07507 +++$+++ Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey!
c10916 +++$+++ But how did it happen?
c10916 +++$+++ You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
c10916 +++$+++ I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
c10916 +++$+++ But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
c10916 +++$+++ But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
c10916 +++$+++ She is an innocent.
c10916 +++$+++ But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
c10916 +++$+++ That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
c10916 +++$+++ Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
c11133 +++$+++ Hey?
c11133 +++$+++ Hmm.
c11133 +++$+++ I lived here all my life, I got a million contacts, but they're all bus boys and bellhops.
c17638 +++$+++ I'm scared.
c17638 +++$+++ Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
c17638 +++$+++ I don't know.
c17638 +++$+++ Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
c17638 +++$+++ I don't want to.
c17638 +++$+++ I want to stay here and watch this.
c08717 +++$+++ ...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
c08717 +++$+++ I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
c08717 +++$+++ He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
c08717 +++$+++ Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on some other scrub. We got one another, s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
c23956 +++$+++ The fault is here, sir, not in the transmission.  The antenna leads have been disconnected. V'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal.
c23956 +++$+++ Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
c23956 +++$+++ Enterprise, I want that signal again. Transmit!
c01001 +++$+++ But why? What's the point?
c01001 +++$+++ A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
c01001 +++$+++ And I suppose you're the knight.
c01001 +++$+++ That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
c10437 +++$+++ Hello, I'm calling from...
c10437 +++$+++ If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
c10437 +++$+++ I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
c10437 +++$+++ From the magazine?
c10437 +++$+++ This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
c10437 +++$+++ How come you're calling me from...?
c10437 +++$+++ This is Miss Costello...?
c10437 +++$+++ Yes. Price...
c10437 +++$+++ Pardon?
c10437 +++$+++ Kathy Price.
c10437 +++$+++ We find that your subscription lapsed...
c10437 +++$+++ My subscription lapsed three years ago...
c10437 +++$+++ That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
c10437 +++$+++ Missus...
c10437 +++$+++ We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
c10437 +++$+++ We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
c10437 +++$+++ No. At Chelsea Childcare. Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey? I'm late for work.
c02264 +++$+++ Wow. Did he go to jail?
c02264 +++$+++ He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
c02264 +++$+++ I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
c02264 +++$+++ What makes you think I'm not?
c21031 +++$+++ Pardon me, ma'am, can I ask you somethin'?
c21031 +++$+++ Yes, Mister McMurphy?
c21031 +++$+++ That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
c22388 +++$+++ Carter?
c22388 +++$+++ Who died?
c22388 +++$+++ You.
c22388 +++$+++ Detective Yu?  Never met him.
c22388 +++$+++ Not Yu.  You!
c22388 +++$+++ Who?
c22388 +++$+++ Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
c00881 +++$+++ Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.
c00881 +++$+++ Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered.
c00881 +++$+++ Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
c00881 +++$+++ Great, yes, I'd like that.
c00881 +++$+++ Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.
c08557 +++$+++ Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
c08557 +++$+++ I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
c08557 +++$+++ There's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?
c08557 +++$+++ We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
c08557 +++$+++ I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
c23757 +++$+++ Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
c23757 +++$+++ Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
c23757 +++$+++ Ten thousand to one, but you pegged it. The toughest shot on the last frame.
c23757 +++$+++ My mom was there. She told me about it. The 'Fazeli Split.'
c02624 +++$+++ Victor, your scar --
c02624 +++$+++ I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
c02624 +++$+++ Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
c23125 +++$+++ You're late, George.
c23125 +++$+++ I gotta talk to you.
c23125 +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it...
c23125 +++$+++ I don't care.
c06679 +++$+++ What?
c06679 +++$+++ Stop now.
c06679 +++$+++ Why? I'm paying for this.
c06679 +++$+++ Not for this. Not me, you're not.
c06679 +++$+++ You find it distasteful, don't you?
c06679 +++$+++ It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
c06679 +++$+++ I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
c06679 +++$+++ You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
c06679 +++$+++ No?
c06679 +++$+++ I never said that.
c07613 +++$+++ I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
c07613 +++$+++ You quit trying to stop anybody--
c07613 +++$+++ Well, at best you might deny it.
c07613 +++$+++ Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
c07613 +++$+++ Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally.  Now what are you crying about?
c18805 +++$+++ Okay, Karen is expecting you in half an hour.  You only have to stay with her one night, she'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there.
c18805 +++$+++ I don't even know this woman.
c18805 +++$+++ Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
c18805 +++$+++ Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
c18805 +++$+++ I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
c18805 +++$+++ My vacation is over in a week.
c18805 +++$+++ I'll make it up to you this summer. I promise.
c18805 +++$+++ I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
c18805 +++$+++ No, Dad.  I have thoughts of my own once in a while.
c00815 +++$+++ Why, yeah.
c00815 +++$+++ I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
c00815 +++$+++ Yes, but just so I could find out who you were.
c08795 +++$+++ But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
c08795 +++$+++ You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
c08795 +++$+++ It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
c08795 +++$+++ Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
c08795 +++$+++ Even Joey Venza?!
c08795 +++$+++ He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
c08795 +++$+++ If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
c17686 +++$+++ You've been very cold to me tonight.
c17686 +++$+++ No.
c17686 +++$+++ Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
c22740 +++$+++ It's your castle, man.
c22740 +++$+++ Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
c22740 +++$+++ Man, you're bringing me down!
c08488 +++$+++ Shame about the kid. Seems a lively sort.
c08488 +++$+++ He is that.
c08488 +++$+++ Bad luck for me. Now I gotta bust him out of there.
c09881 +++$+++ Takes a licking but keeps on ticking...  ... For a while anyway.
c09881 +++$+++ What can I do?  Tell me what to do.
c09881 +++$+++ Nothing to do, I'm afraid.  I'm just a librarian after all.  Wasn't exactly made for all this swashbuckling.  Very Byronic end, though.  I appreciate that.  Do you know Byron?
c09881 +++$+++ Vox...
c09881 +++$+++ I'm babbling.  Good to have someone to talk to for a change... But you need to go.  Take her out of here...  ... I don't have long.
c09881 +++$+++ I won't leave you like this.
c09881 +++$+++ Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
c09881 +++$+++ I'm going to end it, Alexander.  As we discussed...
c22241 +++$+++ Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
c22241 +++$+++ Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
c22241 +++$+++ O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
c11033 +++$+++ Addison...
c11033 +++$+++ She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
c11033 +++$+++ Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
c11033 +++$+++ - something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
c11033 +++$+++ What else?
c27277 +++$+++ What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
c27277 +++$+++ I did kill us. She thinks we're dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
c27277 +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?
c27277 +++$+++ It's part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
c27277 +++$+++ Who's she?
c27277 +++$+++ Elektra King.
c27277 +++$+++ Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
c27277 +++$+++ Makes her look even more innocent.
c27277 +++$+++ I was hoping you could tell me.
c20263 +++$+++ Here.  Ti amo.
c20263 +++$+++ Ti amo.
c20263 +++$+++ You look tired.
c20263 +++$+++ What's your news?
c20263 +++$+++ I'm getting married.
c20263 +++$+++ Again?
c20263 +++$+++ Yeah.
c20263 +++$+++ You did this once it didn't work out.
c20263 +++$+++ The guy died.
c20263 +++$+++ What killed him?
c20263 +++$+++ He got hit by a bus.
c20263 +++$+++ No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
c20263 +++$+++ Johnny Cammareri.
c20263 +++$+++ Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
c20263 +++$+++ He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
c20263 +++$+++ More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
c20263 +++$+++ In a month.
c20263 +++$+++ I won't come.
c20263 +++$+++ You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
c20263 +++$+++ I didn't give you away the first time.
c20263 +++$+++ And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
c20263 +++$+++ Maybe.
c20263 +++$+++ I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
c20263 +++$+++ He did?
c20263 +++$+++ That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
c04804 +++$+++ ONE--TWO--THREE--FOUR--FIVE
c04804 +++$+++ Why, you bully. I believe you would.
c04804 +++$+++ I'm out! I'm out!
c07291 +++$+++ Waitaminute -
c07291 +++$+++ You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
c07291 +++$+++ You can't do this -
c07291 +++$+++ Didn't know you'd be bringin' a friend.  Well, he'll have to wait his turn -
c07291 +++$+++ Hang on there -
c07291 +++$+++ You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!
c07778 +++$+++ He'll do no such thing.
c07778 +++$+++ It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
c07778 +++$+++ Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
c23853 +++$+++ It's getting cold.
c23853 +++$+++ You think I'd really drink that?
c23853 +++$+++ You don't think I put something in it, do you?
c23853 +++$+++ I did do that, didn't I?
c15037 +++$+++ I drive.
c15037 +++$+++ Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
c15037 +++$+++ I'm ready.
c15037 +++$+++ Give me a break, Sanchez.  It's like riding a bike.
c27210 +++$+++ Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
c27210 +++$+++ No you're not -  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
c27210 +++$+++ I would not be too sure.
c08252 +++$+++ What was she to you?
c08252 +++$+++ I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
c08252 +++$+++ I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
c08252 +++$+++ After that wonderful first book --- after all the adulation and the good reviews?
c24370 +++$+++ Well?
c24370 +++$+++ This is fascinating.
c24370 +++$+++ Of course it is.
c24370 +++$+++ Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
c24370 +++$+++ I wrote that with my heart.
c24370 +++$+++ Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
c24370 +++$+++ What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
c24370 +++$+++ It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
c24370 +++$+++ I will not have it butchered.
c24370 +++$+++ Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
c24370 +++$+++ Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
c24370 +++$+++ I don't know.
c24370 +++$+++ What month?
c24370 +++$+++ December twenty-first.
c24370 +++$+++ Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
c24370 +++$+++ Thank you.
c24370 +++$+++ I want you to do this work.
c24370 +++$+++ I don't care.
c15122 +++$+++ Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
c15122 +++$+++ I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
c15122 +++$+++ I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
c15122 +++$+++ Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
c16833 +++$+++ Opening night, Lillian.
c16833 +++$+++ Who the hell cares?
c16833 +++$+++ The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
c16833 +++$+++ That's always been my problem.
c16833 +++$+++ And you've been extremely patient.
c16833 +++$+++ You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
c16833 +++$+++ You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
c16833 +++$+++ I'd forgotten that.
c16833 +++$+++ I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
c16833 +++$+++ That's very lovely actually.
c16833 +++$+++ Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
c16833 +++$+++ Be open with me. I'd like that.
c16833 +++$+++ There may be things you'd rather not know about.
c16833 +++$+++ I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
c16833 +++$+++ I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
c16833 +++$+++ Joanne Bourne.
c16833 +++$+++ Alma Wetzel.
c16833 +++$+++ Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
c16833 +++$+++ She's my gynecologist.
c23432 +++$+++ I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
c23432 +++$+++ In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
c23432 +++$+++ Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
c23432 +++$+++ Yeah.
c14693 +++$+++ A little melodramatic, don't you think.
c14693 +++$+++ I have a flair for drama.
c14693 +++$+++ Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
c14693 +++$+++ Annette?
c05477 +++$+++ How'd this happen?
c05477 +++$+++ I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
c05477 +++$+++ The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
c05477 +++$+++ I don't know. I'll find out though.
c04911 +++$+++ He's the one who wants you.
c04911 +++$+++ It was the other guy who busted me.
c04911 +++$+++ I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
c20520 +++$+++ People said she looked like me.
c20520 +++$+++ I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
c20520 +++$+++ I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
c20520 +++$+++ Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
c20520 +++$+++ Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
c13806 +++$+++ Jody. Wait.
c13806 +++$+++ What?
c13806 +++$+++ Then go to the party. Run with the herd Kenny. Just don't spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
c18985 +++$+++ Mom--I mean, dad?
c18985 +++$+++ Uh, huh?
c18985 +++$+++ What did you do when you were little?
c18985 +++$+++ I guess about the same kind of things you do.
c18985 +++$+++ Uh, uh...We didn't have television then.
c04044 +++$+++ Me?
c04044 +++$+++ My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
c04044 +++$+++ I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
c12327 +++$+++ Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
c12327 +++$+++ Gardiner, yes, sir.
c12327 +++$+++ No problem, Chief.
c19730 +++$+++ Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
c19730 +++$+++ The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
c19730 +++$+++ Why do you think he took his gloves off?
c19730 +++$+++ Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
c19730 +++$+++ Yes. 'Intimate.' They had privacy.  Everybody else was dead.
c10845 +++$+++ Zuria?
c10845 +++$+++ Yes. Until proven otherwise.
c10845 +++$+++ Wait a moment. Can't you see I'm busy?
c23276 +++$+++ You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
c23276 +++$+++ It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
c23276 +++$+++ It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
c23276 +++$+++ I don't get you.
c23276 +++$+++ I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
c23276 +++$+++ Good.
c15026 +++$+++ Looks like ya gonna take office just in time, Chief.  Things need straightening up in this city.
c15026 +++$+++ What'cha got, Bennett?
c15026 +++$+++ Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
c15026 +++$+++ Technothugs?
c15026 +++$+++ I can smell it.
c18034 +++$+++ That would mean they'd been trapped in there--
c18034 +++$+++ --for three hundred years.
c18034 +++$+++ Not unless they're immortal.
c24021 +++$+++ You have to hide.
c24021 +++$+++ Who is that...?
c24021 +++$+++ That's my...
c24021 +++$+++ Oh.
c24021 +++$+++ I...
c21510 +++$+++ Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
c21510 +++$+++ Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
c21510 +++$+++ Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
c21510 +++$+++ Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
c21510 +++$+++ <u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
c21510 +++$+++ Nice embellishment.
c21510 +++$+++ Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
c21510 +++$+++ Don' look, don' look, don' look....
c13016 +++$+++ What the hell're you talking about?
c13016 +++$+++ You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
c13016 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c19083 +++$+++ Listen, uh... Hank and I think it best if you stay on shore.
c19083 +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
c19083 +++$+++ Whatever's out there <u>did</u> flip over a canoe--
c19083 +++$+++ I am <u>not</u> staying on shore.
c19083 +++$+++ It's too dangerous for--
c19083 +++$+++ I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
c19083 +++$+++ I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
c08722 +++$+++ You think you're dreaming me, like you dream her.  Understand something: I am the real Gibarian.  Just a new incarnation.
c08722 +++$+++ What do you want?
c08722 +++$+++ You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
c08722 +++$+++ It can.  Ordinary matter, like ours? Not affected.  Everything else, disintegrates.
c08463 +++$+++ Explain, act crazy?
c08463 +++$+++ Curse and stuff.
c08463 +++$+++ I'm not going to curse.
c08463 +++$+++ You don't mean it. It's just for show.
c08463 +++$+++ It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
c08463 +++$+++ Just make noises then.
c08463 +++$+++ Explain noises.
c08463 +++$+++ Are you going to do this or what?
c08463 +++$+++ You want him coming in the house next time?
c18284 +++$+++ ...Well, I'm not sure where I --
c18284 +++$+++ I need that voucher! I told you a week ago it was important!
c18284 +++$+++ I don't care if you're president of the company! I need that voucher! Now!
c12867 +++$+++ Smells like dirt.
c12867 +++$+++ You get used to it.
c12867 +++$+++ When?
c12867 +++$+++ No. I'm all right. It's working.
c09402 +++$+++ Double down.
c09402 +++$+++ What?!?
c09402 +++$+++ Double down, baby. You gotta double down on an eleven.
c09402 +++$+++ I know, but...
c09402 +++$+++ You gotta do it.
c09402 +++$+++ If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...
c00320 +++$+++ Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
c00320 +++$+++ We're all like that.
c00320 +++$+++ Are you religious?
c00320 +++$+++ You should be.
c03743 +++$+++ The door ws unlocked.  Is it always unlocked?
c03743 +++$+++ It's always locked.
c03743 +++$+++ But here you are inside, aren't you?
c03743 +++$+++ You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
c03743 +++$+++ We tried to be.  We tried to be.
c03743 +++$+++ Dead!  Such a final word.  Dead!  Did you hear that?
c00191 +++$+++ Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
c00191 +++$+++ You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
c00191 +++$+++ No way to start a partnership.
c00191 +++$+++ Shit.  I'm already sorry.
c22232 +++$+++ If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
c22232 +++$+++ Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
c22232 +++$+++ Have patience!
c22232 +++$+++ Leave Me!
c22232 +++$+++ Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
c19180 +++$+++ Jesus Christ...
c19180 +++$+++ Can you fix it?
c19180 +++$+++ No way...
c19180 +++$+++ I am thinking, man!  You think I want to die!  I am thinking!  I--
c03470 +++$+++ I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
c03470 +++$+++ Benjamin?
c03470 +++$+++ Will you unzip my dress?
c03770 +++$+++ Don't touch me.
c03770 +++$+++ Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
c03770 +++$+++ All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
c16543 +++$+++ I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
c16543 +++$+++ Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
c16543 +++$+++ If you want to call it that.
c16543 +++$+++ Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
c16543 +++$+++ That's exactly what I am doing, again.
c16543 +++$+++ Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
c16543 +++$+++ Oh, for pity's sake...
c21526 +++$+++ Did you see that? It's remarkable!
c21526 +++$+++ Huh?
c21526 +++$+++ Well, you know what they say. Human see, human do.
c26550 +++$+++ She getting good care over there?
c26550 +++$+++ Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
c26550 +++$+++ Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
c26550 +++$+++ It's a common medical term.
c04208 +++$+++ Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
c04208 +++$+++ But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
c04208 +++$+++ And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
c04208 +++$+++ Now, Hildy --
c04208 +++$+++ Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
c04208 +++$+++ I can't.
c04208 +++$+++ All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
c04208 +++$+++ Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
c04208 +++$+++ You can let him out on bail, can't you?
c04208 +++$+++ Five hundred dollars.
c04208 +++$+++ Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
c10259 +++$+++ Honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
c10259 +++$+++ Just think about it.
c10259 +++$+++ Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
c10259 +++$+++ Cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
c10259 +++$+++ All right, forget about it.
c08423 +++$+++ Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
c08423 +++$+++ I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
c08423 +++$+++ Let me use your phone.
c08423 +++$+++ I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
c20235 +++$+++ Can I ask you something, Kittridge?
c20235 +++$+++ Certainly Ethan.
c20235 +++$+++ I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
c23902 +++$+++ Are you sure you don't need it?
c23902 +++$+++ I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
c23902 +++$+++ All you have to do is lose your thinking self.  Don't focus on anything.  Let your body do your thinking... You have to learn to act on what you feel, not what you think ... If I had the crystal, it would be much easier.  You could feel the Force immediately... but for now, let yourself go.  You'll pick it up... and someday you'll have no need for that pistol either.
c15608 +++$+++ Bobby?
c15608 +++$+++ Yeah.
c15608 +++$+++ How'd you get the information on DePinto?
c15608 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c15608 +++$+++ Who did you work with to get the--
c15608 +++$+++ A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
c15608 +++$+++ Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
c15608 +++$+++ Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
c15608 +++$+++ Have you been working with Rachel?
c15608 +++$+++ No.
c15608 +++$+++ It's okay.
c01264 +++$+++ Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
c01264 +++$+++ You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
c01264 +++$+++ What happened to "degrees"?
c01264 +++$+++ Then who did?
c24983 +++$+++ Are we talking Emmies?
c24983 +++$+++ Certainly a nomination.
c24983 +++$+++ Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
c24983 +++$+++ Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with master videographer, Christof.
c04519 +++$+++ The last Sankara Stone.
c04519 +++$+++ And they don't even know what it really is.
c04519 +++$+++ Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
c04519 +++$+++ It's still a long way to Delhi. Who knows what might happen.
c20546 +++$+++ Hey Vada. How's your report coming?
c20546 +++$+++ Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
c20546 +++$+++ You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
c20546 +++$+++ I'm sure she did.
c12526 +++$+++ What is this place?
c12526 +++$+++ Some kind of archive --
c12526 +++$+++ You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
c14703 +++$+++ Where the hell do you come off hitting women?
c14703 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c14703 +++$+++ Kathryn. Did you hit her?
c14703 +++$+++ Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
c14703 +++$+++ Did you hit her?
c14703 +++$+++ Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
c15531 +++$+++ How 'bout I give you your balls back?
c15531 +++$+++ Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin.
c15531 +++$+++ Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
c14169 +++$+++ Good evening, sir.
c14169 +++$+++ Good evening.
c14169 +++$+++ It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
c14169 +++$+++ Of course. Food alright?
c14169 +++$+++ Great, sir. Great.
c14169 +++$+++ Try the wine!
c14169 +++$+++ Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
c14169 +++$+++ Won't you join me, sir?
c14169 +++$+++ And you, sir?
c17777 +++$+++ Yes sir, I saw it.
c17777 +++$+++ We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
c17777 +++$+++ He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
c08196 +++$+++ What a bitch!
c08196 +++$+++ It's the influence of all those family films.  Right, Mom?  Hey, Mom??...
c08196 +++$+++ Mrs. Sutphin?
c08196 +++$+++ Mother?
c08196 +++$+++ 0h, shit!
c08196 +++$+++ She wouldn't...
c11013 +++$+++ C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
c11013 +++$+++ One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
c11013 +++$+++ Hey!  I was in shape before we started doing this.
c04052 +++$+++ ... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
c04052 +++$+++ Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
c04052 +++$+++ I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
c04052 +++$+++ Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.
c04052 +++$+++ Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
c04052 +++$+++ But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
c04052 +++$+++ How?  How were we the same people?
c04052 +++$+++ Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
c04052 +++$+++ Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
c04052 +++$+++ No, but...
c04052 +++$+++ But what?
c04052 +++$+++ But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
c04052 +++$+++ You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
c04052 +++$+++ And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
c04052 +++$+++ I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
c04052 +++$+++ You're tougher.
c04052 +++$+++ More confident, maybe.
c04052 +++$+++ Harder.
c04052 +++$+++ Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
c04052 +++$+++ I'm alright.
c04052 +++$+++ Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
c04052 +++$+++ How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?
c06226 +++$+++ ...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
c06226 +++$+++ Yes, I know.
c06226 +++$+++ I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
c06226 +++$+++ Yes, I know.
c06226 +++$+++ So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
c06226 +++$+++ There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
c06226 +++$+++ I don't.
c18810 +++$+++ So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
c18810 +++$+++ Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
c18810 +++$+++ You signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw.  You violated that agreement.
c18810 +++$+++ You cost me my livelihood.  That on which I relied to support my children.
c18810 +++$+++ If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
c18810 +++$+++ I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
c18810 +++$+++ You version of it.
c18810 +++$+++ There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
c18810 +++$+++ We made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.
c18810 +++$+++ InGen is my livelihood, Dr. Malcolm, and I will jealously defend its interests.  People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it.
c17919 +++$+++ Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
c17919 +++$+++ I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
c17919 +++$+++ Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
c17919 +++$+++ WHAT?!
c23212 +++$+++ Well maybe I can get you something.
c23212 +++$+++ That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
c23212 +++$+++ Sid.
c23212 +++$+++ Sid. You must be a very important executive.
c23212 +++$+++ Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
c23212 +++$+++ You do?
c23212 +++$+++ -- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
c20941 +++$+++ Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
c20941 +++$+++ They're healing up nicely.
c20941 +++$+++ Don't hold your breath.
c10706 +++$+++ You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
c10706 +++$+++ I think I might have.
c10706 +++$+++ I think I might've said I was in love with you.
c06126 +++$+++ I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
c06126 +++$+++ Let some of us come down there.
c06126 +++$+++ No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
c06126 +++$+++ I don't want folks to be searched, it makes people uncomfortable. If I can't be safe among my own kind, where can I be? Allah will protect me.
c19106 +++$+++ Sorry?
c19106 +++$+++ I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
c19106 +++$+++ This is what we do?
c19106 +++$+++ I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
c19106 +++$+++ Are you on drugs?
c19106 +++$+++ Kelly--
c19106 +++$+++ I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
c19106 +++$+++ Part of our research--
c19106 +++$+++ Well on this one I'd like you to be.
c22604 +++$+++ Ramon ... listen for the love of God ...
c22604 +++$+++ You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
c22604 +++$+++ Ramon ... listen to me ... I'm in a	jam ... I had to get a job ...
c22604 +++$+++ You Judas ... blood-sucker ...
c22604 +++$+++ Ramon -- listen my kids ...
c22604 +++$+++ Tu! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga! Desgraciado!
c22604 +++$+++ My kids don't have enough to eat!
c22604 +++$+++ You think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
c22604 +++$+++ You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
c08629 +++$+++ What's wrong?
c08629 +++$+++ This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
c08629 +++$+++ When I was a kid... I was never allowed up here...
c21587 +++$+++ Yes, Miss.
c21587 +++$+++ I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
c21587 +++$+++ Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
c21587 +++$+++ Beer?  Well, all right.
c21587 +++$+++ Beer or ale, Miss?
c21587 +++$+++ Right, Miss.
c13993 +++$+++ Was the show covered by every department?
c13993 +++$+++ Exactly according to your instructions, Mr. Kane.  We've got two spreads of pictures.
c13993 +++$+++ And the notice?
c13993 +++$+++ Yes - Mr. Kane.
c13993 +++$+++ Yes, Mr. kane.
c08959 +++$+++ Well, don't have kittens. Genesis is going to work. They'll remember  you in a wreath with Newton, Einstein, Surak...
c08959 +++$+++ Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
c08959 +++$+++ Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
c08959 +++$+++ Every time we have dealings with Starfleet, I get nervous.  We're dealing with something that COULD be perverted into a dreadful weapon. Remember that overgrown boy scout you used to hang out with? That's exactly the --
c16252 +++$+++ Who the fuck are you? Who the fuck are you?
c16252 +++$+++ I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
c16252 +++$+++ I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
c16252 +++$+++ Where's my daughter?
c16252 +++$+++ Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
c16252 +++$+++ Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
c16252 +++$+++ Drop that fucking money!
c16252 +++$+++ Is this a fucking joke here?
c21313 +++$+++ You gonna go get him?
c21313 +++$+++ It's possible.  Why?
c21313 +++$+++ I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
c21313 +++$+++ My little girl, the tough babe.
c15678 +++$+++ And a good read.  Don't waste it.
c15678 +++$+++ Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
c15678 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Katharine.
c15678 +++$+++ Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.
c23295 +++$+++ The minute I saw you. I said to myself, she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a loom?
c23295 +++$+++ Not in years.
c23295 +++$+++ Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
c23295 +++$+++ Why?
c23295 +++$+++ But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
c13797 +++$+++ You can't tell your parents.
c13797 +++$+++ Ok.
c13797 +++$+++ Especially not your dad.
c13797 +++$+++ I won't.
c13797 +++$+++ It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
c13797 +++$+++ You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
c13797 +++$+++ Unless he makes a move during seventh period.
c13797 +++$+++ Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
c13797 +++$+++ I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
c13797 +++$+++ Stag?
c13797 +++$+++ Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
c13797 +++$+++ Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
c16510 +++$+++ One Number Two, and a chicken sal san -- hold the butter, the mayo, the lettuce -- and a cup of coffee... Anything else?
c16510 +++$+++ Now all you have to do is hold the chicken, bring me the toast, charge me for the sandwich, and you haven't broken any rules.
c16510 +++$+++ Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
c05401 +++$+++ Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
c05401 +++$+++ Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
c05401 +++$+++ Knowledge.
c05401 +++$+++ Of what?
c05401 +++$+++ The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
c05401 +++$+++ Why must you know?
c05401 +++$+++ There is a girl there. Her name is Lyssa.
c05401 +++$+++ You lie!
c05401 +++$+++ Could I lie to you and still see your beauty?
c05401 +++$+++ No.
c05401 +++$+++ Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
c10898 +++$+++ Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
c10898 +++$+++ What's your opinion?
c10898 +++$+++ I believe Agnes is different.
c10898 +++$+++ From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
c10898 +++$+++ From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
c10898 +++$+++ How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
c10898 +++$+++ Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
c10898 +++$+++ That's ridiculous...
c10898 +++$+++ In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
c10898 +++$+++ If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
c10898 +++$+++ She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
c10898 +++$+++ So, someone else could have done it.
c10898 +++$+++ No... not in the eyes of the police.
c10898 +++$+++ And in your eyes?
c10898 +++$+++ I've already told you what I thought.
c10898 +++$+++ That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
c10898 +++$+++ You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
c10898 +++$+++ It's possible isn't it?
c10898 +++$+++ One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
c04078 +++$+++ Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
c04078 +++$+++ There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
c04078 +++$+++ Carl Smith.
c05897 +++$+++ There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
c05897 +++$+++ I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
c05897 +++$+++ Thank you.
c05897 +++$+++ Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
c05897 +++$+++ Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked to him last night.
c05897 +++$+++ Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
c02869 +++$+++ Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
c02869 +++$+++ Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
c02869 +++$+++ I don't know, one place's as good as another.
c02869 +++$+++ Have you ever been there before?
c02869 +++$+++ Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
c18081 +++$+++ Want one?
c18081 +++$+++ I don't drink beer.
c18081 +++$+++ What I want is to help my father.
c04823 +++$+++ Huh?
c04823 +++$+++ There's a seat over there for you.
c04823 +++$+++ What's the idea?
c04823 +++$+++ I'd like to sit with my--uh--wife--if you don't mind.
c04823 +++$+++ Wife?
c04823 +++$+++ Oh, excuse me.  I was just tryin'--you know--to make things pleasant.
c09855 +++$+++ Childs!!
c09855 +++$+++ Let go of me...
c09855 +++$+++ What's it going to do, being a plant?
c18121 +++$+++ We must go to the Diplomat.
c18121 +++$+++ Get in.
c18121 +++$+++ After the Diplomat! Paul clambers in the back.
c23648 +++$+++ We didn't find Sounder yet.
c23648 +++$+++ He'll show up one day.
c23648 +++$+++ Naww -- he'll come back to you, soon as his wounds heal. This cake shore is tasty, son.
c12774 +++$+++ How long were you Mr Marsh's personal secretary?
c12774 +++$+++ Six years.
c12774 +++$+++ Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use Cocaine?
c12774 +++$+++ No -- never.
c12774 +++$+++ What about Miss Lawson?
c12774 +++$+++ Yes.
c12774 +++$+++ Tell the court about that, please.
c12774 +++$+++ I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
c12774 +++$+++ Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
c12774 +++$+++ Yes.
c12774 +++$+++ How did he look?
c12774 +++$+++ Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
c12774 +++$+++ Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
c12774 +++$+++ What did Mr. Marsh say?
c27323 +++$+++ CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
c27323 +++$+++ What do you mean, frame-up?
c27323 +++$+++ Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
c16412 +++$+++ That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
c16412 +++$+++ Signs?
c16412 +++$+++ If you have the same power as Alex, you'll be seeing signs soon.  When you see anything creepy or ominous, an in-your-face irony kinda thing? Don't ignore it.  It usually means the difference between life and death.
c16412 +++$+++ That's what Alex used to ask himself right up until...
c24556 +++$+++ Superman???
c24556 +++$+++ Right on the first guess.
c24556 +++$+++ Wha'...what are you doing here?
c24556 +++$+++ I came to talk to you.
c24556 +++$+++ The answer is yes. Now what's the question?
c24556 +++$+++ There's been a lot of confusion in the media about who I am and what I'm up to and all that. I'd like to set the record straight. With your help.
c24556 +++$+++ Unlisted number, Shall we proceed?
c09504 +++$+++ Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
c09504 +++$+++ Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
c09504 +++$+++ No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
c05147 +++$+++ You're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. The monkey on your back is the latest trend. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
c05147 +++$+++ Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
c05147 +++$+++ We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
c05147 +++$+++ You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
c05147 +++$+++ The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
c13210 +++$+++ That doesn't look like very much clay.
c13210 +++$+++ Oh it's enough...
c13210 +++$+++ N-no...
c13027 +++$+++ Mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... Tuttle
c13027 +++$+++ Mumble ... Tuttle ...
c13027 +++$+++ ...aven't you?
c12577 +++$+++ What the fuck's going on here?
c12577 +++$+++ Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
c12577 +++$+++ Why?
c12577 +++$+++ Not that I've seen--but that has no meaning--that means nothing.
c21038 +++$+++ That's it! We made it!
c21038 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
c21038 +++$+++ So do I!
c21038 +++$+++ But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
c21038 +++$+++ You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
c21038 +++$+++ Well, I'll be a son-of-a-bitch...
c06190 +++$+++ That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
c06190 +++$+++ You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
c06190 +++$+++ Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
c06190 +++$+++ There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
c06190 +++$+++ Then be trained.
c06190 +++$+++ I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
c06190 +++$+++ I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
c04966 +++$+++ The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
c04966 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c04966 +++$+++ Who?
c04966 +++$+++ What'd you care?
c04966 +++$+++ I ain't gonna send no roc whore. The woman's cool, I promise.
c08443 +++$+++ Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
c08443 +++$+++ Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
c08443 +++$+++ She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
c11892 +++$+++ That your spider in there? In that bottle?
c11892 +++$+++ Yeah.
c11892 +++$+++ What do you feed him?
c11892 +++$+++ Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
c11892 +++$+++ He never bit me.
c18263 +++$+++ ...You know! For kids!
c18263 +++$+++ ...Why don't I just type this up...
c18263 +++$+++ Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
c18263 +++$+++ Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
c18263 +++$+++ Well, she probably had a deadline...
c18263 +++$+++ Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam...
c16760 +++$+++ There...Ya happy?
c16760 +++$+++ No.
c16760 +++$+++ 'Cause it stinks.
c24786 +++$+++ Hey there, Nickie.
c24786 +++$+++ Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
c24786 +++$+++ Happy Birthday, man.
c24786 +++$+++ That's why it's a classic.  Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
c15292 +++$+++ Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
c15292 +++$+++ Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
c15292 +++$+++ What?
c15292 +++$+++ Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
c07072 +++$+++ Well, one way or the other, Kent State is not good.  We have to get out in front of this thing.  The PR is going to murder us.
c07072 +++$+++ Money.  Follow the money.
c07072 +++$+++ These kids are being manipulated by the Communists.  Like Chambers and Hiss.
c00738 +++$+++ What's the matter dear? What have I done now?
c00738 +++$+++ Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
c00738 +++$+++ Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
c00738 +++$+++ I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
c20171 +++$+++ Hey, Pete.
c20171 +++$+++ Buster.
c20171 +++$+++ Answer me a couple things?
c20171 +++$+++ If I can.
c20171 +++$+++ Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
c20171 +++$+++ We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
c20171 +++$+++ Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
c03839 +++$+++ This is from the movie I was talking about.
c03839 +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
c03839 +++$+++ I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
c03839 +++$+++ That girl? No, never saw her. I don't know anybody.
c03839 +++$+++ I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
c03839 +++$+++ I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
c03839 +++$+++ I don't know nothing, man.
c15029 +++$+++ Funny guy.
c15029 +++$+++ Fuck you - fuck you.
c15029 +++$+++ Your mother.
c05312 +++$+++ The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
c05312 +++$+++ You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
c05312 +++$+++ I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
c05312 +++$+++ --the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
c05312 +++$+++ Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
c12634 +++$+++ What do you want to do?
c12634 +++$+++ I'm doing it.
c12634 +++$+++ Are you a bad boy?
c12634 +++$+++ Whatiya mean?
c12634 +++$+++ Do you want to do bad things?  Anything. anything.
c12634 +++$+++ What do you want?
c12634 +++$+++ No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
c03915 +++$+++ Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
c03915 +++$+++ Story of my life.
c03915 +++$+++ You mean, outside... with her.
c13116 +++$+++ Don't give me that look.
c13116 +++$+++ What look?
c13116 +++$+++ You know what I'm talking about. It's all over your face. That I-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
c13116 +++$+++ I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding.
c11258 +++$+++ Why were you so late tonight
c11258 +++$+++ I was showing Sonya something . . .
c11258 +++$+++ What were you showing her?
c11258 +++$+++ How to read.
c11258 +++$+++ I know, but I had to because . . .
c12383 +++$+++ Yes, my dear?
c12383 +++$+++ Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
c12383 +++$+++ Thank you, Floris.
c12383 +++$+++ Good morning, Lotte!
c14218 +++$+++ Lay it on me.
c14218 +++$+++ It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
c14218 +++$+++ Then let's have it.
c17743 +++$+++ So how are you?
c17743 +++$+++ I'm okay.
c17743 +++$+++ You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
c17743 +++$+++ Oh, nothing much.  You know...
c17743 +++$+++ Well...
c17743 +++$+++ ...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
c17743 +++$+++ Yeah?  Is that an embarrassing question?  Should I have not asked it?
c17743 +++$+++ Probably not.
c17743 +++$+++ Are you, are you out of work or something?
c17743 +++$+++ No, well...I've been trying to write.
c17743 +++$+++ Have you?
c17743 +++$+++ Yeah.
c17743 +++$+++ Well, that's interesting.  Wh-what kind of stuff?
c17743 +++$+++ Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
c17743 +++$+++ No, you can tell me.
c17743 +++$+++ Come on.
c17743 +++$+++ No, I am.  I am.
c17743 +++$+++ Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
c17743 +++$+++ Nobody ever said it.
c17743 +++$+++ Really?
c17743 +++$+++ This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
c17743 +++$+++ Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
c17743 +++$+++ No, the reason I ask is--
c17743 +++$+++ You've always hated my taste in the past.
c17743 +++$+++ No, I haven't.
c17743 +++$+++ You have.
c17743 +++$+++ I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
c17743 +++$+++ I'm not anymore.  I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
c17743 +++$+++ I've done no television whatsoever. No.
c14611 +++$+++ Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
c14611 +++$+++ Fun -- look at that guy...
c14611 +++$+++ It's just the dope, don't worry
c14611 +++$+++ Not me.
c00373 +++$+++ Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
c00373 +++$+++ Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
c00373 +++$+++ If you get it?
c00373 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00373 +++$+++ You might not kill it.
c00373 +++$+++ You think so.
c00373 +++$+++ You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
c00373 +++$+++ You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
c00373 +++$+++ Mmm.
c00373 +++$+++ You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
c00373 +++$+++ I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
c00373 +++$+++ Wonderful!
c08758 +++$+++ Where did you go before?
c08758 +++$+++ When?
c08758 +++$+++ You must have been dreaming.
c00397 +++$+++ What do I have to do for it?
c00397 +++$+++ Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. You don't get enough appreciation around here and it's time we changed things a little.
c00397 +++$+++ I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.
c00397 +++$+++ So?
c00397 +++$+++ He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
c00397 +++$+++ Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
c00397 +++$+++ You? Why?
c00397 +++$+++ Mel's doing some business with me. It's nice to do favors for people you do business with. He was in a hurry. No big deal.
c00397 +++$+++ That was before Twombley was shot. Before he knew.
c00397 +++$+++ What's the difference? Take my truck, take a rest -- stop worrying about Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to do with your old man's place -- he going to stay there?
c00397 +++$+++ Want to buy?
c00397 +++$+++ Don't light that in here. I'm allergic.
c00397 +++$+++ I won't. You interested?
c00397 +++$+++ Maybe.
c00397 +++$+++ You and Mel Gordon?
c00397 +++$+++ Always count on old Wade for a good screwing. Why should I always pay more, sell cheap? Why should you guys make all the money. You and Mel and Jack. Right's right.
c10337 +++$+++ I'm nearly out.
c10337 +++$+++ It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
c10337 +++$+++ Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
c10337 +++$+++ Don't be late.
c17425 +++$+++ Workin'. Pickin' peaches. But I seen a bunch a fellas yellin' when we come in, so I come out to see what's goin' on. What's it all about?
c17425 +++$+++ This here's a strike.
c17425 +++$+++ Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
c17425 +++$+++ Sure. We made a buck since midday.
c09706 +++$+++ What it was, probably...
c09706 +++$+++ Mmm?
c09706 +++$+++ With my little sparrow leading team.
c12565 +++$+++ This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
c12565 +++$+++ --turn the camera off--
c12565 +++$+++ --they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
c12565 +++$+++ --about the Witch--
c26210 +++$+++ What do you want from me?
c26210 +++$+++ What?
c26210 +++$+++ Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
c26210 +++$+++ Do you still have friends on the force?
c26210 +++$+++ Yes, I still have friends on the force.
c26210 +++$+++ Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on.  Daddy?
c26210 +++$+++ What makes you think I could do that?
c26210 +++$+++ You were a cop.
c26210 +++$+++ What makes you think I would do that?
c26210 +++$+++ I'm your son.
c26210 +++$+++ Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
c27391 +++$+++ Is that what you're looking for?
c27391 +++$+++ A piece.  Only a piece.
c27391 +++$+++ Enough for a test.
c27337 +++$+++ You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
c27337 +++$+++ You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
c27337 +++$+++ You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
c27337 +++$+++ I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
c27337 +++$+++ You're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. You risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.
c27337 +++$+++ That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
c13173 +++$+++ I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me.  I'm in no rush for anything.  It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
c13173 +++$+++ Bad manners.
c13173 +++$+++ Yes.  That's right.
c13173 +++$+++ I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
c13173 +++$+++ One's enough.
c12183 +++$+++ Do we know anything about him?
c12183 +++$+++ Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
c12183 +++$+++ Yes.  Yes.  Sometime.
c05369 +++$+++ You must break when the strain becomes too great, or you will harm yourself. And you must concentrate your powers for when they are needed most. What did she answer?
c05369 +++$+++ She was in a great fortress, first in the mountains, then in the jungle. How is that possible?
c05369 +++$+++ It is the Fortress of Krull. I know it only from the stories of wars on other worlds. They did not use it on our world in the first great war, for it costs them enormous power. This time they mean to conquer, at all costs.
c05369 +++$+++ The Fortress moves?
c05369 +++$+++ Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
c05369 +++$+++ Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
c05369 +++$+++ No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
c05369 +++$+++ Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
c05369 +++$+++ Nor will I, till my bride is beside me.
c11507 +++$+++ What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
c11507 +++$+++ A bad insurance risk?
c11507 +++$+++ That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
c11507 +++$+++ A cemetery?
c11507 +++$+++ Gin.
c21184 +++$+++ My hand.
c21184 +++$+++ It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
c21184 +++$+++ Edie...
c21184 +++$+++ Get away from me.
c21184 +++$+++ Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
c21184 +++$+++ Edie, Edie, I...
c24249 +++$+++ Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
c24249 +++$+++ Oh, you were there?
c24249 +++$+++ Oh, thanks. Thanks.
c13975 +++$+++ You're still beautiful...
c13975 +++$+++ Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
c13975 +++$+++ Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
c17184 +++$+++ When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself.
c17184 +++$+++ What did she mean by going flooey?
c17184 +++$+++ I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
c17184 +++$+++ Nothing serious.  A touch of stroke.
c05578 +++$+++ Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
c05578 +++$+++ But... I am a Green Man.  I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
c05578 +++$+++ You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
c05578 +++$+++ And I love you, my husband.
c15769 +++$+++ I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
c15769 +++$+++ How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
c15769 +++$+++ You look like George Washington.
c15769 +++$+++ I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
c15769 +++$+++ It's too soon.
c15769 +++$+++ But the second mouse gets the cheese.
c01817 +++$+++ I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
c01817 +++$+++ Who is Pamela Landy?
c01817 +++$+++ IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
c08904 +++$+++ A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
c08904 +++$+++ What's normal?
c08904 +++$+++ What do you want?
c21205 +++$+++ Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
c21205 +++$+++ Not a dent.  Perfect
c21205 +++$+++ My favorite little cousin.
c21205 +++$+++ OK-- skip it, Einstein. How come you never got no education like the rest of us?
c23546 +++$+++ What happened?
c23546 +++$+++ I got pinched in the elevator.
c23546 +++$+++ Well, now you know how the other half lives.
c23546 +++$+++ And I'm not even pretty.
c23546 +++$+++ They don't care - just as long as you wear skirts.  It's like waving a red flat in front of a bull.
c23546 +++$+++ I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
c23546 +++$+++ Blow where?
c23546 +++$+++ You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
c23546 +++$+++ How can we?  We're broke.
c23546 +++$+++ We can get a job with another band. A male band.
c23546 +++$+++ Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
c23546 +++$+++ But this is so humiliating.
c23546 +++$+++ So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
c23546 +++$+++ All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
c23546 +++$+++ What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
c23546 +++$+++ What are you giving me with the flying fish? I know why you want to stick around - you're after Sugar.
c23546 +++$+++ Me?  After Sugar?
c23546 +++$+++ I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
c23546 +++$+++ Yeah?  Well, I'm your fairy godmother - and I'm keeping an eye on you.
c09133 +++$+++ Any reply from Starfleet to our dispatch, Lieutenant.
c09133 +++$+++ Not as yet, sir.
c09133 +++$+++ Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
c09133 +++$+++ Commander Uhura has been experiencing technical difficulties sir.
c09133 +++$+++ Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
c09133 +++$+++ An omission. After that -
c09309 +++$+++ Speck's the killer all right. We got box loads of evidence. Did 'em all the same way: torture, strangulation. Prostitutes. I don't think we'll be able to write off any outstandings on him -- this is probably the full body count.
c09309 +++$+++ What about his killer?
c09309 +++$+++ What's with the eyelids?
c15517 +++$+++ Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
c15517 +++$+++ He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
c15517 +++$+++ Captain, what do you want?
c15517 +++$+++ Call me Dudley.
c15517 +++$+++ Dudley, what do you want?
c15517 +++$+++ Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
c15517 +++$+++ And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
c14317 +++$+++ Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little... not concerned, exactly, but...
c14317 +++$+++ Tell me.
c14317 +++$+++ Last week, about 3 A.M., Fish -- Dr. Fisher -- was on a late shift, and he found her doing laundry.
c14317 +++$+++ So... there wasn't any clothes in the machine.  She was just sitting there on the floor with her ear pressed up against the Maytag. Listening.
c21538 +++$+++ What is your proposal?
c21538 +++$+++ When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
c21538 +++$+++ Twelve hundred years ago.
c21538 +++$+++ Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls don't tell the whole truth of your history; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them?
c21538 +++$+++ Okay.Up to the cave.
c23289 +++$+++ Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.
c23289 +++$+++ Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
c23289 +++$+++ You can handle this.
c12960 +++$+++ You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
c12960 +++$+++ If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
c12960 +++$+++ ...  yes.
c08678 +++$+++ Breaker. Breaker.
c08678 +++$+++ Pick it up, Breaker.
c08678 +++$+++ What's up, Dixie Chicken?
c16296 +++$+++ Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?
c16296 +++$+++ Mm.
c16296 +++$+++ Say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in Fargo?
c16296 +++$+++ Put you in touch with Grimsrud.
c16296 +++$+++ Well, yah, but he had a buddy there. He, uh -
c16296 +++$+++ Well, I don't vouch for him.
c16296 +++$+++ Well, that's okay, I just -
c16296 +++$+++ I vouch for Grimsrud. Who's his buddy?
c16296 +++$+++ Carl somethin'?
c16296 +++$+++ Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
c16296 +++$+++ Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
c16296 +++$+++ Call 'em up.
c16296 +++$+++ Nope.
c12088 +++$+++ I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
c12088 +++$+++ I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
c12088 +++$+++ As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
c01610 +++$+++ Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?
c01610 +++$+++ Nothing. Are you alright?
c01610 +++$+++ I'll go then.
c10305 +++$+++ I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.
c10305 +++$+++ We're taking the other case.
c10305 +++$+++ Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
c21262 +++$+++ How much for your company at chow?
c21262 +++$+++ Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
c21262 +++$+++ Another C.
c16123 +++$+++ How's Loomis?
c16123 +++$+++ Apparently, fine.  He's coming into work.  That's the good news ...
c16123 +++$+++ Castor's still alive --  Technically.  He's a turnip, on total life-support ...
c18940 +++$+++ Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
c18940 +++$+++ Not much point to this, is there?
c18940 +++$+++ Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
c18940 +++$+++ So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby --
c21479 +++$+++ Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
c21479 +++$+++ Had it with deals.
c21479 +++$+++ Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
c19581 +++$+++ ...I can't hold onto this anymore...
c19581 +++$+++ I'll get you another pain pill. Another morphine pill --
c19581 +++$+++ ...gimme that fuckin' phone...
c19581 +++$+++ Who are you gonna call?
c19581 +++$+++ I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
c19581 +++$+++ Who?
c19581 +++$+++ Is Jack your son?
c23705 +++$+++ Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
c23705 +++$+++ What is Terrance and Phillip?
c23705 +++$+++ Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
c25466 +++$+++ He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
c25466 +++$+++ Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
c25466 +++$+++ Fancies himself a gambler, huh?
c26470 +++$+++ We ain't bad men no more, Bill. Hell, we're farmers.
c26470 +++$+++ Should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to Texas first.
c26470 +++$+++ How long since you shot a gun at a man?  Nine... ten years?
c26470 +++$+++ Eleven.
c26470 +++$+++ Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
c26470 +++$+++ We done stuff before for money, Ned.
c26470 +++$+++ Well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  What'd they do anyhow? Cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
c26470 +++$+++ Well, I guess they got it comin'...  But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.
c24077 +++$+++ Uh.  What is it?
c24077 +++$+++ Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
c24077 +++$+++ He'll be impressed.  The clincher is, you <u>walk</u> away, then <u>whip</u> around...
c07867 +++$+++ Who's that?
c07867 +++$+++ Whadda you care?
c07867 +++$+++ Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
c07867 +++$+++ No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
c07867 +++$+++ Yeah --
c07867 +++$+++ Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
c07867 +++$+++ Go 'head.
c07867 +++$+++ You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
c07867 +++$+++ How do you know? You know her that good?
c07867 +++$+++ Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right...
c03899 +++$+++ Will they really teach me to shoot?
c03899 +++$+++ Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
c03899 +++$+++ And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
c03899 +++$+++ Oh sure.
c03899 +++$+++ How about hand-to-hand combat?
c03899 +++$+++ Yes.
c03899 +++$+++ To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
c03899 +++$+++ Eh?
c03899 +++$+++ How about to slit his throat?
c03899 +++$+++ Well, I don't...
c03899 +++$+++ I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
c03899 +++$+++ Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
c03899 +++$+++ Sir, how about souvenirs?
c03899 +++$+++ Souvenirs?
c03899 +++$+++ Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
c03899 +++$+++ What's the chance of getting one of these?
c04274 +++$+++ We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
c04274 +++$+++ Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
c04274 +++$+++ I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
c19999 +++$+++ I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
c19999 +++$+++ Deals?
c19999 +++$+++ It's isolated.
c19999 +++$+++ Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
c19999 +++$+++ Sorry.
c04342 +++$+++ So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately.
c04342 +++$+++ Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body?
c04342 +++$+++ No, why?
c04342 +++$+++ Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair.
c04342 +++$+++ Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
c04342 +++$+++ I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
c04342 +++$+++ And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
c13407 +++$+++ Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
c13407 +++$+++ Yeah.
c13407 +++$+++ Why do you need that much?
c13407 +++$+++ Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
c13407 +++$+++ Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
c13407 +++$+++ Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for.
c17167 +++$+++ What makes you say that?
c17167 +++$+++ Just thinking out loud.
c17167 +++$+++ Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
c17167 +++$+++ All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
c17167 +++$+++ Fuck you.
c17167 +++$+++ We're watching the movie, Harry. You got that!  We are watching my fucking movie.
c24661 +++$+++ Who else phoned?
c24661 +++$+++ The renting agent and the tailor.
c24661 +++$+++ It won't leave much of a balance in the bank...  Mr. Robard?  Could you locate him?
c27230 +++$+++ Never seen anything like that in all my years.
c27230 +++$+++ He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
c27230 +++$+++ We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
c27230 +++$+++ John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
c27230 +++$+++ Yes. Samuel! We're going.
c17808 +++$+++ ...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
c17808 +++$+++ They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
c17808 +++$+++ Fine, thank you, but
c17808 +++$+++ Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
c17808 +++$+++ ...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
c17808 +++$+++ ...and that is what you need to expand.
c17808 +++$+++ I don't understand.
c17808 +++$+++ We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
c17808 +++$+++ Because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
c10307 +++$+++ They're just frightened, fucked-up losers that prison fucked up worse.
c10307 +++$+++ I didn't ask for a closing argument.
c10307 +++$+++ There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
c10307 +++$+++ -- Yeah?
c10307 +++$+++ So an upstanding member of the Aryan Warriors wouldn't paint them on. They take those teardrops seriously -- they're badges of courage, of honor. Only their most vicious killer elite get to wear them...!
c10307 +++$+++ Hey, Clyde Gruner sold these guys a pound of crystal meth at cost. We're Clyde's buddies, it's cool.  Next exit.
c13477 +++$+++ - with stupid braces on your teeth.
c13477 +++$+++ Okay, then.
c13477 +++$+++ Uh, talk to you later.  Bye.
c05621 +++$+++ Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
c05621 +++$+++ To check up on me?
c05621 +++$+++ I'll be around to check up on you.
c05621 +++$+++ Why would you be there?
c05621 +++$+++ You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
c09288 +++$+++ I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
c09288 +++$+++ You never told me.
c09288 +++$+++ No, it's not.
c23576 +++$+++ The New Caledonia.  That's the name of it.  The Old Caledonia went down during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.  But tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us.
c23576 +++$+++ Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
c23576 +++$+++ That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.
c15469 +++$+++ You did it at your house?  Your own house?
c15469 +++$+++ Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
c15469 +++$+++ In love?
c15469 +++$+++ Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
c15469 +++$+++ But you haven't written your novel.
c15469 +++$+++ Dave, I'm just saying this as your friend.  What you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.
c01598 +++$+++ Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
c01598 +++$+++ Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
c01598 +++$+++ Oh yeah? Have you seen any?
c01598 +++$+++ I've seen a few.
c01598 +++$+++ Okay honey.
c03484 +++$+++ Do you want to hear it or not?
c03484 +++$+++ Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
c03484 +++$+++ I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
c03484 +++$+++ What one.
c03484 +++$+++ What?
c03484 +++$+++ I don't remember.
c11763 +++$+++ Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
c11763 +++$+++ I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
c11763 +++$+++ Thank you.
c18831 +++$+++ Ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
c18831 +++$+++ You can't hold it by yourself!
c18831 +++$+++ I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
c10725 +++$+++ Fucking Mariners.
c10725 +++$+++ Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
c10725 +++$+++ What party?
c10725 +++$+++ Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty.  She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White.
c22835 +++$+++ Alright Kincaid, no where to?
c22835 +++$+++ I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
c22835 +++$+++ Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
c22055 +++$+++ What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
c22055 +++$+++ More history, Rose.
c22055 +++$+++ Are you going to get your degree soon?
c22055 +++$+++ Well, I am working on my thesis.
c22055 +++$+++ It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
c22055 +++$+++ You're so sweet.
c24221 +++$+++ You sure have to hand it to those guys.
c24221 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c24221 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c18684 +++$+++ All the time....
c18684 +++$+++ It'll work....
c18684 +++$+++ If we're real lucky, it'll eat itself....
c22269 +++$+++ Well, if it isn't Mr. Interpol himself.  I can't believe I misjudged you like I did.
c22269 +++$+++ Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
c22269 +++$+++ I'm a patriate.
c22269 +++$+++ Don't even think that I'm buying that.
c22269 +++$+++ Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
c22269 +++$+++ Bloody fucking hell...
c05920 +++$+++ Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
c05920 +++$+++ Kay.  All I'm saying--
c05920 +++$+++ I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
c05920 +++$+++ I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
c05920 +++$+++ That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
c23712 +++$+++ This is the millennium, Saddam! This is Armageddon! There's more to life than sex!
c23712 +++$+++ Hey, relax guy!
c23712 +++$+++ I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
c04223 +++$+++ Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
c04223 +++$+++ The what?
c04223 +++$+++ The City Sealer's office!
c04223 +++$+++ Yes, yes!
c05299 +++$+++ Hello?
c05299 +++$+++ Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
c05299 +++$+++ You know her?
c05299 +++$+++ Not really.
c05299 +++$+++ Why her?
c05299 +++$+++ Because she's the type.
c05299 +++$+++ But you said you didn't know her.
c05299 +++$+++ I know what I said!  She looks just like...
c05299 +++$+++ Just like who?
c05299 +++$+++ I really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  I find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
c05299 +++$+++ You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
c14132 +++$+++ No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him.
c14132 +++$+++ Do you still talk to Sylvan?
c14132 +++$+++ I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
c14132 +++$+++ That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
c14132 +++$+++ I will. Take it easy.
c14132 +++$+++ Bye  That was Snowball.
c15196 +++$+++ You don't like Public Enemy?  It's the dope shit.
c15196 +++$+++ I like 'em, but you don't play anything else.
c15196 +++$+++ I don't like anything else.
c15196 +++$+++ Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
c15196 +++$+++ Yeah, I know dat motherfucker.
c15196 +++$+++ I'm trying to organize a boycott of Sal's pizza joint.  Ya see what I'm saying?
c15196 +++$+++ I almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  Tell me, tell me, Radio Raheem, to turn my music down. Didn't even say please.  Who the fuck he think he is?  Don Corleone and shit.
c15196 +++$+++ He makes all his money off us Black people and I don't see nuthin' but Italians all up in there, Sylvester Stallone and motherfuckers.  Ya see what I'm saying, homeboy?
c15196 +++$+++ Talk to me.
c15196 +++$+++ We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
c15196 +++$+++ You got my back.
c22380 +++$+++ Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
c22380 +++$+++ Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
c22380 +++$+++ Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
c22380 +++$+++ Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
c22380 +++$+++ You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
c15786 +++$+++ What's chromium?
c15786 +++$+++ It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
c15786 +++$+++ I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
c11534 +++$+++ To me?
c11534 +++$+++ I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
c11534 +++$+++ Oh, yes. Thanks.
c11534 +++$+++ The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
c11534 +++$+++ So it was.  She threw it at me.
c11534 +++$+++ Sir?
c11534 +++$+++ You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
c11534 +++$+++ I know how it is.
c11534 +++$+++ You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
c11534 +++$+++ No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
c11534 +++$+++ Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
c11534 +++$+++ Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
c11534 +++$+++ Roger. And I'll get that other key.
c27302 +++$+++ Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
c27302 +++$+++ Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
c27302 +++$+++ Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
c04640 +++$+++ I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
c04640 +++$+++ I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
c04640 +++$+++ Do me a favor, will you? Spare me, for God's sake. Get in the real world. What do you think? I'm going to resign in protest? To force it on the air? The answer is "no." I don't plan to spend the end of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio.  That decision I've already made.
c21307 +++$+++ Was a she, name Tuffy.
c21307 +++$+++ Where do you think I might find Maurice?
c21307 +++$+++ The State Theater?
c07316 +++$+++ You... in the Navy?
c07316 +++$+++ That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
c07316 +++$+++ Why?
c07316 +++$+++ To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
c07316 +++$+++ Nobody. It just came to me.
c09762 +++$+++ Erin. It's not your fault.
c09762 +++$+++ It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
c09762 +++$+++ Yes I do, I really do.
c01594 +++$+++ Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
c01594 +++$+++ Have him committed.
c01594 +++$+++ Yeah! That's thinking.
c01594 +++$+++ He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
c01594 +++$+++ I don't know. I like to think so.
c01594 +++$+++ Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
c01594 +++$+++ To get some frozen poultry.
c01594 +++$+++ Then what?
c01594 +++$+++ We came back to the house!
c01594 +++$+++ You didn't stop anywhere else?!
c01594 +++$+++ No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
c01594 +++$+++ What?!
c01594 +++$+++ Come on.
c04833 +++$+++ All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
c04833 +++$+++ God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
c04833 +++$+++ A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
c04833 +++$+++ Bullshit!  Bartender, another round...  Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.
c01822 +++$+++ Don't need it. I remember everything.
c01822 +++$+++ Sounds like a threat.
c01822 +++$+++ Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
c25621 +++$+++ What does that mean?
c25621 +++$+++ Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
c25621 +++$+++ Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
c11816 +++$+++ And the students?
c11816 +++$+++ I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
c11816 +++$+++ How do I know this isn't a trap?
c11816 +++$+++ You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
c11816 +++$+++ You may use my office.
c22302 +++$+++ Time to quit.
c22302 +++$+++ Just like that?
c22302 +++$+++ Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
c22302 +++$+++ What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
c22302 +++$+++ Would you stop with that...
c22302 +++$+++ Why?  You've got more force of will than anyone I've ever seen.  You handle a gun like it's a part of you, you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia...  And most amazing of all, you quit smoking, just like that.
c22302 +++$+++ The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
c22302 +++$+++ Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
c22302 +++$+++ Because I don't walk away.
c22302 +++$+++ Why not?
c22302 +++$+++ It's the one thing I've got left to hold onto.  Jean-Pierre is one of your closest friends, is he not?
c22302 +++$+++ Closest and oldest.
c22302 +++$+++ And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
c22302 +++$+++ And when you finish?  What then?  This package, whatever it is, do you give it to the CIA?  Do you really think they deserve it?
c22302 +++$+++ That's a good question.
c22302 +++$+++ No, I don't.
c06889 +++$+++ Mister, what are you dragging me into?
c06889 +++$+++ I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
c06889 +++$+++ Cover your mouth.
c06889 +++$+++ What?
c06889 +++$+++ This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
c06889 +++$+++ Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off.
c23067 +++$+++ No, can't think of anything else that matters.
c23067 +++$+++ About the mail --
c23067 +++$+++ It's very kind of you to offer, but --
c23067 +++$+++ Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
c14675 +++$+++ I don't find this very funny,
c14675 +++$+++ So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
c14675 +++$+++ Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
c14675 +++$+++ Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
c14675 +++$+++ Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
c14675 +++$+++ I see your point... though why should I care?
c14675 +++$+++ I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
c14675 +++$+++ She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
c11495 +++$+++ By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
c11495 +++$+++ Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
c11495 +++$+++ Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
c11495 +++$+++ How many of those drinks did you have?
c11495 +++$+++ I thought so.
c01919 +++$+++ But why my name, Richard?
c01919 +++$+++ Because you're getting on that plane.
c01919 +++$+++ I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
c21775 +++$+++ So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
c21775 +++$+++ Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
c21775 +++$+++ What kind of school?
c21775 +++$+++ So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a "B."  Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see.
c17694 +++$+++ Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
c17694 +++$+++ What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
c17694 +++$+++ Are you?
c17694 +++$+++ What, you, of c-- What are you talking about?  Of course not.  I'd be destroyed!
c14975 +++$+++ She fucked you?
c14975 +++$+++ She fucked me.
c14975 +++$+++ She fucked me too.
c14975 +++$+++ She fucked me too.
c20137 +++$+++ They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy.
c20137 +++$+++ Then the roads are open...
c20137 +++$+++ The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
c20137 +++$+++ The phones are working?
c20137 +++$+++ Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
c20137 +++$+++ My daughter must be going nuts.
c20137 +++$+++ ...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
c20137 +++$+++ Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
c20535 +++$+++ She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
c20535 +++$+++ She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
c20535 +++$+++ You're being narrow-minded.
c21566 +++$+++ Good morning. Can I do something for you?
c21566 +++$+++ I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
c21566 +++$+++ I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
c21566 +++$+++ Bank?
c21566 +++$+++ I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
c25280 +++$+++ So you did talk about it, huh?
c25280 +++$+++ On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
c25280 +++$+++ What do you suggest?
c25280 +++$+++ Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
c10046 +++$+++ No You mean...?
c10046 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c10046 +++$+++ That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
c18658 +++$+++ You and Sean used to make....
c18658 +++$+++ I have to get this finished.
c18658 +++$+++ I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't want to do that with you unhappy....
c18658 +++$+++ I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
c18658 +++$+++ I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
c18658 +++$+++ I'm your mother.  It's my job....
c23094 +++$+++ So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
c23094 +++$+++ did you hear anything before he cries?
c23094 +++$+++ No, not that I recall, I was asleep.
c23094 +++$+++ Have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days?
c23094 +++$+++ No, nothing, sorry.
c23094 +++$+++ Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
c23094 +++$+++ Of course.
c23094 +++$+++ There are only two other people in the flat.
c14789 +++$+++ I can't read any more crap. These women are all victims.
c14789 +++$+++ Yes, that's what we're looking for.
c14789 +++$+++ I'll make a note of that. Put the coverage on my desk.
c12552 +++$+++ I want to see something!
c12552 +++$+++ Whatever you want.
c12552 +++$+++ --no, what's wrong with you?
c15958 +++$+++ Oh mom, you should have seen this man came along on this beautiful grey horse.  Wasn't it pretty?
c15958 +++$+++ Really, what kind was it a mair or guilding?
c15958 +++$+++ Your kidding?
c17872 +++$+++ Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
c17872 +++$+++ Where is he? Where's J.D.?
c17872 +++$+++ Get a job.
c18026 +++$+++ You're hurt.
c18026 +++$+++ I'll be fine.
c18026 +++$+++ What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
c18026 +++$+++ Because it's my name.
c18026 +++$+++ I don't know anymore.
c06385 +++$+++ Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
c06385 +++$+++ What do you want from me?
c06385 +++$+++ Something I guess I can't have anymore.
c06385 +++$+++ Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
c06385 +++$+++ You think I didn't need you?
c06385 +++$+++ Ronnie...
c23504 +++$+++ But back in '34, Japanese-born could not <u>own</u> land.  So...?
c23504 +++$+++ Carl held it <u>for</u> 'em.  Called it a lease.  They make payments every June and December...
c23504 +++$+++ Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
c14926 +++$+++ Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
c14926 +++$+++ Just like that?!  You just knew?
c14926 +++$+++ Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
c14926 +++$+++ Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
c15773 +++$+++ Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
c15773 +++$+++ You're giving them to me?
c15773 +++$+++ Call it an expression of trust.
c15773 +++$+++ You don't really think I'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag?  What matters isn't what's real. It's what we <u>think</u> is real--what matters is the art.
c14364 +++$+++ ... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
c14364 +++$+++ Recommendations?
c14364 +++$+++ Have your department make a full report.
c24493 +++$+++ I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
c24493 +++$+++ We'd better talk.
c24493 +++$+++ I'm listening.
c24493 +++$+++ Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
c24493 +++$+++ I guess it would be all right if -  Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
c08650 +++$+++ I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
c08650 +++$+++ How much style?
c08650 +++$+++ You paying for the gas?
c03912 +++$+++ Where am I?
c03912 +++$+++ You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
c03912 +++$+++ Don't worry. He's O.K. We sent him home hours ago. Jeez, what a story.
c00006 +++$+++ do you listen to this crap?
c00006 +++$+++ What crap?
c00006 +++$+++ Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
c14604 +++$+++ Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
c14604 +++$+++ Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
c14604 +++$+++ Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
c02119 +++$+++ To coincidence.
c02119 +++$+++ There's a casino in this hotel.
c02119 +++$+++ I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
c02119 +++$+++ So why did you come to my casino?
c02119 +++$+++ I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
c02119 +++$+++ First visit to London?
c02119 +++$+++ No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
c02119 +++$+++ I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
c02119 +++$+++ Near the casino.
c02119 +++$+++ In the casino.
c02119 +++$+++ Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
c02119 +++$+++ Your father?
c02119 +++$+++ I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
c02119 +++$+++ The debts.
c02119 +++$+++ And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
c02119 +++$+++ And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
c02119 +++$+++ That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
c02119 +++$+++ We all came from Africa, supposedly.
c02119 +++$+++ Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
c07286 +++$+++ What did you say?
c07286 +++$+++ The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
c07286 +++$+++ No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
c07286 +++$+++ Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...
c13915 +++$+++ Is there anything else you want to know?
c13915 +++$+++ Where you were when your husband died.
c13915 +++$+++ I can't tell you.
c13915 +++$+++ You mean you don't know where you were?
c13915 +++$+++ You were seeing someone, too.
c15135 +++$+++ Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
c15135 +++$+++ I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
c15135 +++$+++ I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
c15135 +++$+++ Stand by, Powell.  I gotta check something out.
c20670 +++$+++ Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
c20670 +++$+++ She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
c20670 +++$+++ Waiter! Check, please!
c20670 +++$+++ Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
c04618 +++$+++ What the hell are you doing?
c04618 +++$+++ What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
c04618 +++$+++ No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
c04618 +++$+++ Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!
c14778 +++$+++ I think George knows.
c14778 +++$+++ About Mark? Carlton?
c14778 +++$+++ About Benito.
c14778 +++$+++ No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
c26315 +++$+++ What happened to your hand?
c26315 +++$+++ Accident.
c26315 +++$+++ You've got to be--
c26315 +++$+++ Yeah, I know.  More careful.
c26315 +++$+++ I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
c26315 +++$+++ Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
c26315 +++$+++ I'm a solid man.
c26315 +++$+++ John Stewart.
c26315 +++$+++ What brings you to Sierra?
c26315 +++$+++ My car overheated.  I pulled in to have it fixed.
c26315 +++$+++ Where you headed?
c26315 +++$+++ I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
c26315 +++$+++ Live there?
c26315 +++$+++ Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
c26315 +++$+++ You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
c26315 +++$+++ I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
c26315 +++$+++ It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.
c26315 +++$+++ Ah, I can smell it on you.
c04337 +++$+++ I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
c04337 +++$+++ Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
c04337 +++$+++ Lila?
c23819 +++$+++ Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
c23819 +++$+++ That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
c23819 +++$+++ I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response.
c18922 +++$+++ -- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
c18922 +++$+++ No.
c18922 +++$+++ Well I have to close up now.
c18922 +++$+++ Look -- could I use your phone?
c18922 +++$+++ Yes indeed.
c18922 +++$+++ Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
c22565 +++$+++ Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
c22565 +++$+++ It's only ten o'clock.
c22565 +++$+++ Jonah!
c22565 +++$+++ Okay.
c22565 +++$+++ Thank Victoria for dinner.
c22565 +++$+++ I'm glad you liked it.  Good night, Jonah.
c02369 +++$+++ I hope I'm not interrupting.
c02369 +++$+++ Take a seat -- you're next.
c02369 +++$+++ That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
c11703 +++$+++ If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
c11703 +++$+++ It smells like shit in here?
c11703 +++$+++ Go away.
c11703 +++$+++ That cleaning woman doesn't...
c11703 +++$+++ Please, just leave.
c11703 +++$+++ Get out.
c13139 +++$+++ You packing up tonight?
c13139 +++$+++ Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
c13139 +++$+++ London.
c13139 +++$+++ London.  That's a promotion!
c13139 +++$+++ I don't think so.
c13139 +++$+++ It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
c13139 +++$+++ Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
c09633 +++$+++ Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
c09633 +++$+++ Sandra Sinclair.
c09633 +++$+++ Gimmee her number, I'll have her pick you up.
c09633 +++$+++ I wanna close up soon.  C'mon, let's call her.
c09885 +++$+++ And what of the Eloi?
c09885 +++$+++ They survived above.  Became what they are.
c09885 +++$+++ No... they didn't survive only to be your food.  You did that.
c09885 +++$+++ I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
c09885 +++$+++ But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
c09885 +++$+++ It can't all be like this...
c02582 +++$+++ We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
c02582 +++$+++ That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
c02582 +++$+++ Something like that, yeah.
c01561 +++$+++ Whatcha looking at?
c01561 +++$+++ Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
c01561 +++$+++ Say what?!
c01561 +++$+++ How do you do, ma'am.
c01561 +++$+++ Good!
c18580 +++$+++ Mike and Larry are racing! Loser goes home alone!
c18580 +++$+++ If we beat them, they can both go home stag!  Single-O!  Alone! Jackie can come back in this boat!
c18580 +++$+++ What about me?
c18580 +++$+++ Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
c21201 +++$+++ --I was gonna feed 'em, Terry.
c21201 +++$+++ 's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
c21201 +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured--  They got it made. Eat all they want-- fly around like crazy-- sleep side by side-- and raise gobs of squabs.
c25531 +++$+++ That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
c25531 +++$+++ Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
c25531 +++$+++ I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
c25531 +++$+++ You're going to return every cent of it!
c25531 +++$+++ I can't! I haven't got it!
c25531 +++$+++ What did you do with the rest?
c25531 +++$+++ Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
c26686 +++$+++ What?
c26686 +++$+++ At the seven-eleven.
c26686 +++$+++ Who? What are you talking about?
c26686 +++$+++ Nobody's smoking anybody out.
c24193 +++$+++ What's the gun for, General Ripper?
c24193 +++$+++ Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
c24193 +++$+++ That's right, Major.
c21748 +++$+++ What was I supposed to do?  I told the truth.  Why should the truth upset you?  It's not as if you're from a convent.
c21748 +++$+++ I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
c21748 +++$+++ Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
c19695 +++$+++ Long gone, huh?
c19695 +++$+++ I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
c19695 +++$+++ Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
c19695 +++$+++ Nahhh...
c13409 +++$+++ Huh?
c13409 +++$+++ Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
c13409 +++$+++ I didn't take your pills.
c13409 +++$+++ Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em?
c13409 +++$+++ What?
c25313 +++$+++ And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
c25313 +++$+++ An Austrian.
c25313 +++$+++ Questions can amount to revelations. Now, I'd hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
c19181 +++$+++ Go on!
c19181 +++$+++ No!
c19181 +++$+++ Fuck your orders!
c05520 +++$+++ I didn't mean --
c05520 +++$+++ Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
c05520 +++$+++ Well, yeah, but --
c05520 +++$+++ I just don't want to see you get your hopes up. You know how you get.
c22796 +++$+++ He sent me the cutest e-mail.
c22796 +++$+++ I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
c22796 +++$+++ We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
c22796 +++$+++ You'd me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It's a whole world, Sid. You're really popular amongst the demented.
c22796 +++$+++ Until now.
c22820 +++$+++ What do you care? Let 'em have their fun. So, what's up?
c22820 +++$+++ What's your favorite scary movie?
c22820 +++$+++ Closer than you think.
c03461 +++$+++ Is anything wrong, sir?
c03461 +++$+++ What? No. Nothing.
c03461 +++$+++ Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
c03461 +++$+++ Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
c03461 +++$+++ Where is it?
c03461 +++$+++ What?
c03461 +++$+++ Where is your luggage?
c03461 +++$+++ Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
c03461 +++$+++ Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
c03461 +++$+++ Oh no.
c03461 +++$+++ Sir?
c03461 +++$+++ Of course.
c13105 +++$+++ My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
c13105 +++$+++ It's best not to ...  It's good pizza, huh?
c13105 +++$+++ Not as good as Nino's.
c13105 +++$+++ You remember that pizza place, Joe's on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years ago?  When you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
c13105 +++$+++ Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
c13105 +++$+++ I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
c13105 +++$+++ On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
c13105 +++$+++ We moved out after that. Upstate.
c13105 +++$+++ Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
c13105 +++$+++ They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
c13105 +++$+++ Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
c21077 +++$+++ Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
c21077 +++$+++ Tha's your problem.
c21077 +++$+++ Who do you like in the opening game, Sam?
c21077 +++$+++ Asshole.
c19622 +++$+++ Be ready at two --
c19622 +++$+++ Should be one-thirty.
c19622 +++$+++ Love you too.
c14687 +++$+++ If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
c14687 +++$+++ Where is she?
c14687 +++$+++ You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
c14687 +++$+++ She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
c18602 +++$+++ You're going down there again?
c18602 +++$+++ Yes.
c18602 +++$+++ After what happened to us?
c18602 +++$+++ Kathryn, you're crazy.  Really crazy.  A suicidal maniac.
c07877 +++$+++ You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
c07877 +++$+++ So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
c07877 +++$+++ What do you mean, "you"?
c07877 +++$+++ What?
c07877 +++$+++ What do you mean, "you"?
c07877 +++$+++ I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
c07877 +++$+++ But you said "you."
c07877 +++$+++ So what?
c07877 +++$+++ Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
c07877 +++$+++ You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
c07877 +++$+++ Did you ever fuck my wife?
c07877 +++$+++ What?
c07877 +++$+++ I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
c07877 +++$+++ Whadda ya mean?
c07877 +++$+++ Did you ever fuck my wife?
c07877 +++$+++ Whatsa matter with you?
c07877 +++$+++ I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
c13530 +++$+++ I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
c13530 +++$+++ I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
c13530 +++$+++ She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
c13530 +++$+++ Did you have to tell her my name?
c01295 +++$+++ We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
c01295 +++$+++ Where's your shirt, Mueller?
c01295 +++$+++ Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
c15364 +++$+++ He's a <u>bum</u>.
c15364 +++$+++ No he's not!  Do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "Dracula"!  "The Raven"! "The Black Cat"!
c15364 +++$+++ Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
c15364 +++$+++ That's not true --
c15364 +++$+++ Well, uh, if I could I would...
c25238 +++$+++ Pedro is waiting for me, too.
c25238 +++$+++ Rosita ---- I have wondered ---
c25238 +++$+++ When you are going to see Pedro, does your heart beat until you tremble?
c04793 +++$+++ There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
c04793 +++$+++ Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
c04793 +++$+++ Carrots.
c04793 +++$+++ Raw?
c04793 +++$+++ Uh-huh. Want one?
c04793 +++$+++ No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
c04793 +++$+++ I hate the horrid stuff.
c13634 +++$+++ So it's true, then?
c13634 +++$+++ What?
c13634 +++$+++ Yes.
c04617 +++$+++ So, what are you going to do?
c04617 +++$+++ Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
c04617 +++$+++ You're taking "no" for an answer?
c04617 +++$+++ Then what are you going to do?
c08595 +++$+++ Don't cry.
c08595 +++$+++ It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
c08595 +++$+++ Someone else can help you. Someone else can make you happy.
c16924 +++$+++ Promise you won't laugh.
c16924 +++$+++ If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
c16924 +++$+++ That bad?
c07143 +++$+++ These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.
c07143 +++$+++ That's possible.
c07143 +++$+++ But you don't believe it.
c07143 +++$+++ It's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?
c03547 +++$+++ Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
c03547 +++$+++ Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
c03547 +++$+++ Oh -- good evening, Baron.
c03547 +++$+++ How's the beautiful lady?
c03547 +++$+++ Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
c03547 +++$+++ Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
c03547 +++$+++ Well -- last night was not so good.
c03547 +++$+++ Yes -- but the audience.
c21728 +++$+++ Three hundred.
c21728 +++$+++ Fine.
c21728 +++$+++ What's your name, lover.
c21728 +++$+++ Edward... you got it!
c15068 +++$+++ Loan shark -- hey?
c15068 +++$+++ Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
c15068 +++$+++ Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
c15068 +++$+++ Yes, it's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer!
c10032 +++$+++ Louise!
c10032 +++$+++ What?!
c10032 +++$+++ What in the hell is that up there?
c10032 +++$+++ Way up ahead!
c05708 +++$+++ I can't do it.
c05708 +++$+++ That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
c05708 +++$+++ What'd you say?
c05708 +++$+++ Don't call me soft, I hate it when you call me that.
c00986 +++$+++ So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
c00986 +++$+++ Well, it's kind of weird.
c00986 +++$+++ We don't judge here.
c00986 +++$+++ OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
c00986 +++$+++ I don't wanna take over the family business.
c08109 +++$+++ What the fuck am I doing here? I felt funny about this job right off. As soon as I felt it I should said "No thank you", and walked. But I never fucking listen. Every time I ever got burned buying weed, I always knew the guy wasn't right. I just felt it. But I wanted to believe him. If he's not lyin' to me, and it really is Thai stick, then whoa baby. But it's never Thai stick. And I always said if I felt that way about a job, I'd walk. And I did, and I didn't, because of fuckin' money!
c08109 +++$+++ What's done is done, I need you cool. Are you cool?
c08109 +++$+++ Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
c25299 +++$+++ Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you're my secretary, all right?
c25299 +++$+++ Your secretary, huh!
c25299 +++$+++ What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
c22620 +++$+++ Who is it?
c22620 +++$+++ It's me.
c22620 +++$+++ Please open the door, Danny.
c16374 +++$+++ A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
c16374 +++$+++ If you could fight any celebrity?
c16374 +++$+++ Alive or dead?
c16374 +++$+++ Doesn't matter.
c16374 +++$+++ Shatner.  William Shatner.
c08578 +++$+++ You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
c08578 +++$+++ Thank you.
c08578 +++$+++ You could play the lead.
c08578 +++$+++ But that's Simone's part.
c08578 +++$+++ Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
c08578 +++$+++ No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
c07616 +++$+++ Fine, but kinda thirsty.
c07616 +++$+++ Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
c07616 +++$+++ Okay - you remember Joe--
c07616 +++$+++ Sure.
c07616 +++$+++ It's all right. Bring him in.
c18017 +++$+++ I'll go first.
c18017 +++$+++ No -- I will.
c18017 +++$+++ I stood up first.
c18017 +++$+++ You always get to go first.
c25895 +++$+++ Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
c25895 +++$+++ ...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
c25895 +++$+++ You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
c15843 +++$+++ You must survive, Luke.
c15843 +++$+++ I'm cold ... so cold ...
c15843 +++$+++ You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
c15843 +++$+++ Luke ... you are the only hope.
c18047 +++$+++ I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
c18047 +++$+++ Fine.
c18047 +++$+++ There's nothing I can do.  I'll wait. One way or another soon it will all be over soon.
c14443 +++$+++ The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
c14443 +++$+++ You got a suspect...
c14443 +++$+++ How'd you get in on the deal?
c14443 +++$+++ I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
c14443 +++$+++ You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
c14443 +++$+++ Or the F.B.I.?
c14443 +++$+++ Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
c14443 +++$+++ Nikko?
c12015 +++$+++ Now what?
c12015 +++$+++ What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
c12015 +++$+++ She knew she could beat it.  That's why she asked to take it.
c12015 +++$+++ How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
c12015 +++$+++ Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
c12015 +++$+++ Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
c12015 +++$+++ How you're saying she killed her parents?  Did she kill Bobby Vasquez, too?
c04367 +++$+++ It's quiet.
c04367 +++$+++ Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
c04367 +++$+++ I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
c24673 +++$+++ Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
c24673 +++$+++ I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
c24673 +++$+++ This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
c24673 +++$+++ My mission is to protect you.
c24673 +++$+++ You did.  Thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
c22194 +++$+++ If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
c22194 +++$+++ Gazzo's a good man.
c22194 +++$+++ Keep this job, ya eat better.
c16556 +++$+++ I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
c16556 +++$+++ She lives near Eddie?
c16556 +++$+++ I think she lives down by Pitt.
c16556 +++$+++ Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
c16556 +++$+++ I think by Twenty-two.
c16556 +++$+++ What you want with her anyway'
c03360 +++$+++ Well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
c03360 +++$+++ Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
c03360 +++$+++ You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
c03360 +++$+++ That would definitely explain it.
c22411 +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
c22411 +++$+++ I did!
c22411 +++$+++ Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
c09028 +++$+++ Mr. Sulu...? ... Mr. Sulu?!
c09028 +++$+++ ... Aye sir...?
c09028 +++$+++ What is our condition?
c09028 +++$+++ Picture, please.
c12779 +++$+++ What happened next?
c12779 +++$+++ I had bypass surgery.
c12779 +++$+++ And how are you now?
c12779 +++$+++ Fine.  The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
c12779 +++$+++ How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
c12779 +++$+++ It didn't.
c12779 +++$+++ She left me.
c20311 +++$+++ Loretta...
c20311 +++$+++ Johnny...
c20311 +++$+++ Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
c20311 +++$+++ Good.
c20311 +++$+++ Have you come to make peace with me?
c20311 +++$+++ Of course I want to.
c05380 +++$+++ I don't think you'll grow careless.
c05380 +++$+++ Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
c05380 +++$+++ Fame.
c05380 +++$+++ Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
c05380 +++$+++ Fame is what you leave to your sons.
c05380 +++$+++ How did you know I had sons?
c05380 +++$+++ Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
c05380 +++$+++ I know you.
c16502 +++$+++ Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
c16502 +++$+++ You're goin' a find me dead one time.
c16502 +++$+++ Sssh, come on now...  Be a good girl.
c16502 +++$+++ If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
c16502 +++$+++ Do you love me, Bobby?
c08951 +++$+++ Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
c08951 +++$+++ Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
c08951 +++$+++ Uh -- what are they?
c08951 +++$+++ For your eyes. For most patients of your age, I generally administer Retlax Five to restore flexibility of the lens.
c08951 +++$+++ Exactly. Happy birthday.
c20570 +++$+++ Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
c20570 +++$+++ They're great.
c20570 +++$+++ How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
c20570 +++$+++ Uh huh, well...good to know. Phil hands Nick a               5 note
c02534 +++$+++ Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
c02534 +++$+++ I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
c02534 +++$+++ Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
c02534 +++$+++ I have a family, Mary.
c02534 +++$+++ You made me have an abortion.
c02534 +++$+++ It was a mutual decision.
c02534 +++$+++ I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
c25346 +++$+++ My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
c25346 +++$+++ I -- I don't understand...
c25346 +++$+++ You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
c00534 +++$+++ You think this is the guy who did it?
c00534 +++$+++ We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
c00534 +++$+++ To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
c00534 +++$+++ Who else can I ask around here?
c00534 +++$+++ I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
c18986 +++$+++ Was there apple juice when you were little?
c18986 +++$+++ Yeah, there was apple juice.
c18986 +++$+++ Was there Burger King?
c18986 +++$+++ What else wasn't there?
c26348 +++$+++ Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
c26348 +++$+++ You expect me to believe that?
c26348 +++$+++ I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
c26348 +++$+++ What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
c03098 +++$+++ You live in Miami?
c03098 +++$+++ That's right.
c03098 +++$+++ What're you doing in Los Angeles?
c03098 +++$+++ I'm in the movie business.
c03098 +++$+++ You're an investor, is that it?
c03098 +++$+++ I'm a producer.
c03098 +++$+++ Not yet. I just started.
c00752 +++$+++ All I know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. The way I see it, Brown here looks guilty.
c00752 +++$+++ What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
c00752 +++$+++ So have you. So have I. So's everybody got a record. What difference does that make? You can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they--
c25593 +++$+++ My leg is falling asleep.
c25593 +++$+++ It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
c25593 +++$+++ It falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.
c19015 +++$+++ Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer.  One inch over and it would have caught the eye.
c19015 +++$+++ But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
c19015 +++$+++ Ten.
c18115 +++$+++ I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
c18115 +++$+++ As long as it is scotch.  Your white friends have abandoned you, Paul.
c18115 +++$+++ The United Nations are still here.
c18115 +++$+++ The United Nations. Madmen are on the streets, Paul. But I will take care of you.  Your cellar is well-stocked, right?
c18115 +++$+++ Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I overheard something that I think you should know about.
c18115 +++$+++ What did you overhear?
c18115 +++$+++ A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
c18115 +++$+++ What did they say?
c18115 +++$+++ Watch everything? How? They are gone.
c23316 +++$+++ As a new member of our order, I think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
c23316 +++$+++ A what?
c23316 +++$+++ A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
c23316 +++$+++ No food.  Not until sundown.
c09072 +++$+++ This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
c09072 +++$+++ But it's comfortable.
c09072 +++$+++ Why don't you try sitting up?
c09072 +++$+++ You're in quite a mood today.
c18512 +++$+++ Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
c18512 +++$+++ Aw, forget it.
c18512 +++$+++ Hope you enjoy it.
c23564 +++$+++ No!
c23564 +++$+++ Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
c23564 +++$+++ Yes.
c02063 +++$+++ So much for honor among thieves. You would have cut loose your friends, your girl...
c02063 +++$+++ I was doing it for them.
c02063 +++$+++ BULLSHIT! You were scared, Jake! You lost your nerve! You lost your confidence! You weren't being noble. You weren't trying to save anybody but yourself! Admit it.
c02063 +++$+++ Yes it is, Jake! Yes it is! They were right there for you. She was right there for you! Look at her!
c16375 +++$+++ Fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
c16375 +++$+++ Any historical figure.
c16375 +++$+++ Okay... Ghandi.
c16375 +++$+++ Good answer.
c16375 +++$+++ Abe Lincoln.  Big reach.  Skinny guys fight till they're burger.
c13840 +++$+++ What?  Say again...
c13840 +++$+++ ...Mason.  I can barely hear you.
c13840 +++$+++ We've got it...
c13840 +++$+++ Hold it!
c09041 +++$+++ As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect.  Your associates are people of good character.
c09041 +++$+++ They are my friends.
c09041 +++$+++ Tell her I feel fine...
c25690 +++$+++ M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
c25690 +++$+++ Um-hum ...
c25690 +++$+++ Just a second.
c10471 +++$+++ I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
c10471 +++$+++ Don't you live at home?
c10471 +++$+++ No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
c10471 +++$+++ I have no close folks.  My parents died when I was a kid.
c19188 +++$+++ I'm going inside.
c19188 +++$+++ What's your air reading?
c19188 +++$+++ Twenty minutes!...Who had tank duty?
c20089 +++$+++ What d'you want?
c20089 +++$+++ What?
c20089 +++$+++ What you got me up here for?
c20089 +++$+++ Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
c20089 +++$+++ You want me to leave?
c20089 +++$+++ No, yes. No, I mean yes please go. Help me to be good. Come back tomorrow. Promise.
c20089 +++$+++ This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
c10332 +++$+++ CIA?
c10332 +++$+++ Telephone.  I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --
c10332 +++$+++ And you b-believe that.
c27176 +++$+++ Can you fill me in here?
c27176 +++$+++ Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
c27176 +++$+++ Thank you.
c27176 +++$+++ You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.
c03546 +++$+++ Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
c03546 +++$+++ Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
c03546 +++$+++ No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.
c20158 +++$+++ Paul, I know you've been out.
c20158 +++$+++ What?
c20158 +++$+++ You've been out of your room.
c20158 +++$+++ No, I haven't.
c20158 +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
c19085 +++$+++ You know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
c19085 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c19085 +++$+++ When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
c19085 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c19085 +++$+++ I'm saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake <u>and</u> a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
c19085 +++$+++ Gee, that was so poetic, Jack.  I'm all moist.
c19085 +++$+++ Forgive me for trying to be nice.
c19085 +++$+++ Nice?  Nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
c19085 +++$+++ I didn't say it like that.
c19085 +++$+++ You <u>did</u>, you--
c19085 +++$+++ I was trying to pay you a compliment, I was guising it as science 'cause I know you're comfortable in that arena. Science.
c19085 +++$+++ Just forget it.
c24066 +++$+++ Because it's quiet.  And he wants to talk.  Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
c24066 +++$+++ What are you gonna talk about?
c24066 +++$+++ Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
c24066 +++$+++ Then why are you putting on mascara?
c24066 +++$+++ I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
c24066 +++$+++ But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
c24066 +++$+++ Or blush.  You look pale.
c17947 +++$+++ Uh, er... I...
c17947 +++$+++ You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
c17947 +++$+++ Well, I'm not entitled to a million dollars.  I... I... didn't expect... I didn't expect...
c17947 +++$+++ Uh, actually... yes... I... should never have come forward and presented myself as --
c18793 +++$+++ I'd better get going.
c18793 +++$+++ Let me know if I can help, Alan. You're bad about asking for help, but please ask me. Anything, anytime.
c18793 +++$+++ Goodbye, Alan.
c23876 +++$+++ Wisconsin's your answer.
c23876 +++$+++ Wisconsin?
c23876 +++$+++ Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
c23876 +++$+++ Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it for you.
c14774 +++$+++ I think I just got my period.
c14774 +++$+++ Does that mean this whole thing is over?
c14774 +++$+++ Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
c14774 +++$+++ Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
c14774 +++$+++ So are you. Look, go about your life. Act like nothing's wrong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
c02036 +++$+++ Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
c02036 +++$+++ Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
c02036 +++$+++ You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
c02036 +++$+++ I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
c03439 +++$+++ Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
c03439 +++$+++ I don't see how we can.
c03439 +++$+++ I have to go back now.
c03078 +++$+++ He's my sister's kid. No papa. Not too bright. Personally, I think he's a retard. I only gave him the job as a favor for my sister, you understand?
c03078 +++$+++ Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
c03078 +++$+++ He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
c03078 +++$+++ Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
c03078 +++$+++ You gave him the money?
c03078 +++$+++ I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
c03078 +++$+++ Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
c03078 +++$+++ A zillion, huh? That's a lot.
c23615 +++$+++ Hello, Charlie.  Long time no see.
c23615 +++$+++ What is it, Spats?  What do you want here?
c23615 +++$+++ Just dropped in to pay my respects.
c23615 +++$+++ Oh, I wouldn't say that.  You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
c11743 +++$+++ He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
c11743 +++$+++ That means you won't have a gun.
c11743 +++$+++ That's right.
c11743 +++$+++ And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
c11743 +++$+++ If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
c11743 +++$+++ You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
c11743 +++$+++ I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
c11743 +++$+++ We split the money?
c11743 +++$+++ Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
c11743 +++$+++ Sounds pretty well figured out.
c11743 +++$+++ I've been thinking about it for a long time.
c11743 +++$+++ Except --
c11743 +++$+++ What?
c11743 +++$+++ Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
c11743 +++$+++ I told you, he will.
c11743 +++$+++ I was.
c18953 +++$+++ How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
c18953 +++$+++ They don't scare me any more.
c18953 +++$+++ Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
c11236 +++$+++ Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
c11236 +++$+++ Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
c11236 +++$+++ You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
c09626 +++$+++ Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
c09626 +++$+++ Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
c09626 +++$+++ Why?
c09626 +++$+++ Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
c09626 +++$+++ Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up.  Broke mine, too.  But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure.  C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
c05735 +++$+++ Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
c05735 +++$+++ What can I do about it?
c05735 +++$+++ You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
c05735 +++$+++ Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
c05735 +++$+++ Go get a soda out of the fridge.
c05735 +++$+++ "But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
c22149 +++$+++ You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
c22149 +++$+++ I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
c22149 +++$+++ Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
c26216 +++$+++ Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
c26216 +++$+++ Where'd you come from?
c26216 +++$+++ Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
c14167 +++$+++ Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.
c14167 +++$+++ Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.
c14167 +++$+++ Been punished, yeah?
c14167 +++$+++ I've been cured.
c14167 +++$+++ Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
c14167 +++$+++ Long time, is right. I don't remember them days too horrorshow. Don't call me Dim no more, either. Officer, call me.
c26668 +++$+++ Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
c26668 +++$+++ What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
c26668 +++$+++ It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
c26668 +++$+++ By... no... the name I do not remember. A rich man, a powerful man.  It is not an unusual story. She came from somewhere small, to the south of the city... some say from a mission settlement... young, yes; very young.  And she was found singing and dancing in a cabaret by the man... wait... wait... Ives! His name was Ives!  Yes. And he took her and built for her this great house in the Western Addition... and there was a child. Yes. This was it. The child.
c21677 +++$+++ Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
c21677 +++$+++ That's good.
c21677 +++$+++ And Joe Ramage - do you remember him?  He comes and helps out in the shop.
c21677 +++$+++ Yes, you said.
c21677 +++$+++ Now, are you going to have some more tea?
c21677 +++$+++ Or a beer.  I've got some in.
c09995 +++$+++ We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
c09995 +++$+++ I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
c09995 +++$+++ In case of what?
c09995 +++$+++ In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
c09995 +++$+++ We'd have to.  That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
c09468 +++$+++ Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
c09468 +++$+++ You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
c09468 +++$+++ On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
c02110 +++$+++ What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
c02110 +++$+++ What about a drink on the way home?
c02110 +++$+++ I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
c02110 +++$+++ Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
c08425 +++$+++ Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
c08425 +++$+++ Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
c08425 +++$+++ No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
c08425 +++$+++ Keep it elevated.
c25160 +++$+++ Not too fast.
c25160 +++$+++ You said they didn't have night guards.
c25160 +++$+++ They don't. I checked twenty times.... Somebody must have talked.
c25160 +++$+++ Who even knew?
c25160 +++$+++ Mrs. Moebius.
c25160 +++$+++ Why? Why would she?
c25160 +++$+++ So what do we do with the device?
c15437 +++$+++ Oh my God.
c15437 +++$+++ It's... okay
c15437 +++$+++ I kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
c15437 +++$+++ Well, when you put it that way.
c15437 +++$+++ Leave. Go.
c15437 +++$+++ Can't we just --
c15437 +++$+++ All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
c22679 +++$+++ What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
c22679 +++$+++ Vecchio.
c22679 +++$+++ Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
c22679 +++$+++ Yeah.
c22679 +++$+++ You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
c22679 +++$+++ Bits and pieces.
c22679 +++$+++ She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
c22679 +++$+++ And what about your own hand?
c22679 +++$+++ No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
c22679 +++$+++ It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
c22679 +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
c22679 +++$+++ Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
c22679 +++$+++ And how do you bluff yourself?
c22679 +++$+++ Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
c22679 +++$+++ Except this time, the mission IS a man.
c22679 +++$+++ That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
c22679 +++$+++ John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
c22679 +++$+++ You want me to take over?
c01765 +++$+++ I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
c01765 +++$+++ Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
c01765 +++$+++ That could be anybody's.
c01765 +++$+++ They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
c01765 +++$+++ Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
c01765 +++$+++ The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
c01765 +++$+++ I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
c15516 +++$+++ Come in out of the rain, Bud.
c15516 +++$+++ You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
c15516 +++$+++ We talked.
c15516 +++$+++ So tell me about it.
c15516 +++$+++ No.  Now.  You fucked him.
c19757 +++$+++ Glaser Safety Slugs?
c19757 +++$+++ ...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
c19757 +++$+++ Kevlar Second Chance.
c19757 +++$+++ I hope you have a second chance...
c19757 +++$+++ Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
c19757 +++$+++ Let's walk the route.
c14089 +++$+++ What the fuck did you do that for?
c14089 +++$+++ Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
c14089 +++$+++ Jesus!
c14089 +++$+++ And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
c14089 +++$+++ What?
c14089 +++$+++ If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?
c14089 +++$+++ You're a danger to both the dead and the living.
c14089 +++$+++ I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny.
c14089 +++$+++ I know I'm your hero.
c00235 +++$+++ He's a she!
c00235 +++$+++ You noticed...
c00235 +++$+++ There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
c00235 +++$+++ Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
c23286 +++$+++ LET THY SPIRIT
c23286 +++$+++ You know what we're saying!
c23286 +++$+++ I think they hear you!
c22369 +++$+++ What the hell is that?
c22369 +++$+++ Those are five hundred dollar chips.
c22369 +++$+++ Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
c22369 +++$+++ No, I just assumed...
c22369 +++$+++ You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
c22369 +++$+++ Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?
c19973 +++$+++ Are you okay?
c19973 +++$+++ A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
c19973 +++$+++ Yer damn right.
c24994 +++$+++ What're we doing here, Truman?
c24994 +++$+++ This is where it started.
c24994 +++$+++ What exactly?
c24994 +++$+++ Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
c24994 +++$+++ No.
c24994 +++$+++ When you were hauling chickens for Kaiser Poultry, what was the furthest you ever went off the island?
c24994 +++$+++ I went all over but I never found a place like this.  Look at that sunset, Truman.  It's perfect.
c24994 +++$+++ Yeah...
c24994 +++$+++ That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
c24994 +++$+++ Really?
c25679 +++$+++ Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
c25679 +++$+++ My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
c25679 +++$+++ Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
c25679 +++$+++ I promised her she'd be safe.
c25679 +++$+++ It's our only option.
c25679 +++$+++ It won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
c25679 +++$+++ Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
c25679 +++$+++ You've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two Police Officer fatalities. I'll need your badge and your weapon.
c24179 +++$+++ Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
c24179 +++$+++ I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
c24179 +++$+++ What do you think of this, Mister President?  I told you we shouldn't let him in here.
c13701 +++$+++ I believe you.
c13701 +++$+++ Thanks very much.
c13701 +++$+++ Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
c13701 +++$+++ Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
c13701 +++$+++ Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
c13701 +++$+++ You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
c13701 +++$+++ Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
c13701 +++$+++ Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
c24530 +++$+++ You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
c24530 +++$+++ I've been on the job.
c24530 +++$+++ A hot story, huh?
c24530 +++$+++ It was hot, yes.
c24530 +++$+++ You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
c24530 +++$+++ Lois isn't here?
c24530 +++$+++ She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
c24530 +++$+++ It's for that piece she's doing on women and competition. She's off to the Women's Western Golf Classic.
c13967 +++$+++ Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
c13967 +++$+++ Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
c13967 +++$+++ Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
c13967 +++$+++ Then why don't you change jobs?
c13967 +++$+++ Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
c13967 +++$+++ No...
c13967 +++$+++ Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good...  Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing.
c13967 +++$+++ But don't you like anything about what you do?
c13967 +++$+++ Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!!
c05211 +++$+++ Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early.
c05211 +++$+++ Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler.
c05211 +++$+++ Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
c12310 +++$+++ Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
c12310 +++$+++ Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
c12310 +++$+++ Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
c12310 +++$+++ Yes, Thomas, that is correct. Then he stopped visiting my garden.
c12310 +++$+++ You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
c21535 +++$+++ Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.
c21535 +++$+++ Read it yourself.
c21535 +++$+++ Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
c04168 +++$+++ What now?
c04168 +++$+++ His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
c04168 +++$+++ So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
c14288 +++$+++ Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
c14288 +++$+++ I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
c14288 +++$+++ I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
c09830 +++$+++ Sure.
c09830 +++$+++ Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
c09830 +++$+++ Then let's act like friends. Let's talk.  I know this is a new place, and --
c04812 +++$+++ Any of your passengers want a place to sleep--there's an auto camp up yonder a piece.
c04812 +++$+++ Yeah? Where?
c04812 +++$+++ Up yonder. See the lights?
c04812 +++$+++ Yeah.
c04812 +++$+++ Thanks.
c20316 +++$+++ That's my house.
c20316 +++$+++ You mean the whole house?
c20316 +++$+++ Yes.
c20316 +++$+++ My God, it's a mansion!
c20316 +++$+++ It's a house.
c20316 +++$+++ I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
c20316 +++$+++ Well. That explains it.
c16125 +++$+++ How is the "date night" idea going over with Eve?
c16125 +++$+++ Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
c16125 +++$+++ You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
c16125 +++$+++ You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex?
c23688 +++$+++ Mom...
c23688 +++$+++ Yes, hon?
c23688 +++$+++ Sure, hon. Goodnight.
c21514 +++$+++ Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
c21514 +++$+++ Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
c21514 +++$+++ To begin with, your methods of dating the past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations.
c02856 +++$+++ Electricity.
c02856 +++$+++ It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
c02856 +++$+++ Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
c02856 +++$+++ But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
c02856 +++$+++ It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
c02856 +++$+++ Nonsense. Tonight you will draft an apology to Professor Krempe...
c17329 +++$+++ Would you shut the fuck up! I know what you ordered, I was there!
c17329 +++$+++ So why don't you give me my sandwhich?
c17329 +++$+++ What do you mean "your sandwhich?" I bought it.
c17329 +++$+++ Yah, all right...
c17329 +++$+++ How much money you got?
c17329 +++$+++ I told you, I just got change.
c17329 +++$+++ Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
c17329 +++$+++ I think you should establish a good line of credit.
c11669 +++$+++ And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
c11669 +++$+++ Otherwise, you're not ugly.
c11669 +++$+++ What's with the dark?
c15183 +++$+++ Oh! And another thing. I am a liar. A pathological liar. There was no day in Danang, no multiple tours in Nam. Just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  Truth is... I'm scared shitless all the time.
c15183 +++$+++ What about your toe?
c15183 +++$+++ Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
c15183 +++$+++ What do you think, dumbshit?
c14727 +++$+++ What'd you get for Christmas?
c14727 +++$+++ I don't know yet.
c14727 +++$+++ My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
c14727 +++$+++ No.
c14727 +++$+++ Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
c02713 +++$+++ What could they do? The guy that took the head was about six-seven, and maybe three-hundred pounds. He was packing two Lugers, and the others had M-16s.
c02713 +++$+++ They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
c02713 +++$+++ ...and every one of them stacked naked...
c19378 +++$+++ The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
c19378 +++$+++ No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
c19378 +++$+++ You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on?
c19378 +++$+++ I got to go.  I'm late.
c19378 +++$+++ Call me tomorrow.
c19378 +++$+++ There's other guys as good as me, Loomis.
c19378 +++$+++ Yeah.  But not as cheap.  Call me.
c19378 +++$+++ A couple of weeks.
c19378 +++$+++ One question.
c19378 +++$+++ Who is she?
c20664 +++$+++ It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
c20664 +++$+++ ... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
c20664 +++$+++ ... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
c05849 +++$+++ Good morning, Lovey.
c05849 +++$+++ I beg your pardon.
c05849 +++$+++ Good morning--
c18848 +++$+++ Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
c18848 +++$+++ I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
c18848 +++$+++ Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
c18848 +++$+++ Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.
c13632 +++$+++ You do something for me, Dil?
c13632 +++$+++ Anything.
c13632 +++$+++ You'd do anything for me?
c13632 +++$+++ You got the keys to the shop?
c12627 +++$+++ Yes.
c12627 +++$+++ See my nipples?
c12627 +++$+++ You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
c00963 +++$+++ Austin, may I have a word with you?
c00963 +++$+++ Of course, luv.
c00963 +++$+++ Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
c00963 +++$+++ Don't be sorry. You're right to be suspicious. I shagged her. I shagged her rotten.
c00963 +++$+++ I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
c00963 +++$+++ Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
c00963 +++$+++ No, did you use a condom?
c00963 +++$+++ Only sailors use condoms, man.
c00963 +++$+++ Not in the Nineties.
c00963 +++$+++ Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me.
c00963 +++$+++ Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
c00963 +++$+++ You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
c11997 +++$+++ I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
c11997 +++$+++ You paid $50,000 for your character?
c11997 +++$+++ I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
c11997 +++$+++ Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
c10940 +++$+++ Well, it's nice to know you think we're clever.
c10940 +++$+++ And cunning.
c10940 +++$+++ And what do you do about it?
c10940 +++$+++ Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
c10940 +++$+++ Pity.
c10940 +++$+++ Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
c10940 +++$+++ Yes.
c10940 +++$+++ Of course.
c02452 +++$+++ You know, my son, our lord said...
c02452 +++$+++ Your lord.
c02452 +++$+++ I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
c23492 +++$+++ Ah, coffee. Smells good.
c23492 +++$+++ One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
c23492 +++$+++ Thanks.
c23492 +++$+++ What time did you get to bed last night?
c23492 +++$+++ I don't know. Two or three. It was pretty late.
c23492 +++$+++ You work too hard, you know that?
c23492 +++$+++ Once a story gets hold of you, it's hard to let go.  Besides, I'm making up for lost time.
c23492 +++$+++ Just so you don't overdo it. You don't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish.
c23492 +++$+++ If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
c23492 +++$+++ That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
c23492 +++$+++ If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
c23492 +++$+++ Come on, just a little hint.
c23492 +++$+++ Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
c23492 +++$+++ The inspiration.
c23492 +++$+++ Yeah, right. The inspiration. It's a true story anyway, so I don't suppose it can hurt, can it?
c23492 +++$+++ No way.
c23492 +++$+++ All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
c23492 +++$+++ No, not the end. The beginning.  His son was just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just as he's unwrapping his cheese sandwich, he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice -- right there at his feet. He bends down to take a closer look, and suddenly he feels that he's looking into a mirror, that he's looking at himself. There he is -- dead -- and the body is perfectly intact, sealed away in a block of ice -- like someone preserved in suspended animation. He gets down on all fours, looks right into the dead man's face, and realizes that he's looking at his father.
c08888 +++$+++ Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
c08888 +++$+++ But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
c08888 +++$+++ Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
c17495 +++$+++ Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
c17495 +++$+++ Good evening, Mr. Blank.
c17495 +++$+++ How are you? How's business?
c17495 +++$+++ Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
c17495 +++$+++ How's that?
c17495 +++$+++ I visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I've been seeing in Newsweek.
c17495 +++$+++ Oh, you know me, Martin. I'm the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed I got shot for at Kent State. But why don't we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
c24542 +++$+++ Ahh. 'National Geographic." In my day, this made 'Playboy" look like Mother Goose.
c24542 +++$+++ I don't mean to denigrate your misspent youth, Lex, but what does that rock have to do with --
c24542 +++$+++ Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
c24542 +++$+++ No, you're going to get kissed,
c05090 +++$+++ My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
c05090 +++$+++ I am an expert!
c05090 +++$+++ You're a teacher.
c05090 +++$+++ What if they're carrying? Did you even check?
c10194 +++$+++ No.
c10194 +++$+++ What do you want?
c10194 +++$+++ I want it back.
c10194 +++$+++ Yesterday.
c21025 +++$+++ Excuse me.
c21025 +++$+++ Yes.
c21025 +++$+++ Bad news.
c21025 +++$+++ What?
c21025 +++$+++ We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
c21025 +++$+++ So?
c21025 +++$+++ So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
c21025 +++$+++ What book?
c21025 +++$+++ The one down your trousers.
c21025 +++$+++ I haven't got a book down my trousers.
c21025 +++$+++ Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
c21025 +++$+++ Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec.
c14982 +++$+++ You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!
c14982 +++$+++ Who? Who is?
c14982 +++$+++ You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
c14982 +++$+++ I know! I fuckin' know!
c14982 +++$+++ You don't!
c14982 +++$+++ I do!!!
c14982 +++$+++ I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
c14982 +++$+++ She does not!
c14982 +++$+++ Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
c14982 +++$+++ In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
c14982 +++$+++ In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
c14982 +++$+++ She does, Vince! That's what I'm telling you! She does!!!
c07424 +++$+++ I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
c07424 +++$+++ I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
c07424 +++$+++ Uh... uh... I...
c06138 +++$+++ I better not come in.
c06138 +++$+++ I ain't stupid.
c06138 +++$+++ I mean it's late, baby.
c06138 +++$+++ I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need my rest.
c17140 +++$+++ Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
c17140 +++$+++ Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
c17140 +++$+++ You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
c17140 +++$+++ Yeah, it was once.
c17216 +++$+++ She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
c17216 +++$+++ It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
c17216 +++$+++ I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital.
c22838 +++$+++ Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
c22838 +++$+++ What does this have to do with Sid?
c22838 +++$+++ Well Sid's dad couldn't help you and he was married to Maureen.
c04738 +++$+++ I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
c04738 +++$+++ That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami--  for the love of it?
c04738 +++$+++ Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
c04738 +++$+++ Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
c04738 +++$+++ If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized.
c13358 +++$+++ He even played golf with the President.
c13358 +++$+++ On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
c13358 +++$+++ ...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
c06841 +++$+++ I ain't trying to rob you...
c06841 +++$+++ Shut up!  Fo' I pump this Glock in yo' ass!  What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?
c06841 +++$+++ Man, Day-Day is my people!
c06841 +++$+++ I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
c06841 +++$+++ If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
c27018 +++$+++ I know that you're evil.
c27018 +++$+++ I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
c27018 +++$+++ No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
c26701 +++$+++ OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
c26701 +++$+++ Shut up Boyd.
c26701 +++$+++ He's having a problem here.
c24950 +++$+++ Lieutenant!  It's me.
c24950 +++$+++ What is it?
c24950 +++$+++ Dr. Green has to see you!
c24950 +++$+++ It's important.  Please.  You have to come!  Pendergast, too.  She's found out something.
c13515 +++$+++ Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
c13515 +++$+++ I actually got some memory back last night.
c13515 +++$+++ How much?
c13515 +++$+++ Oh now this one is mine...
c18101 +++$+++ Marlon and Al....
c18101 +++$+++ We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
c18101 +++$+++ You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
c15864 +++$+++ You could have warned him before you shut him off.
c15864 +++$+++ Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
c15864 +++$+++ Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
c23618 +++$+++ What's his problem?
c23618 +++$+++ What?
c23618 +++$+++ There's something about him that's just a bit odd.
c23618 +++$+++ No, that's not it.
c17888 +++$+++ You'll never guess what's happened!!
c17888 +++$+++ What??
c17888 +++$+++ That idiot boarder?
c22089 +++$+++ We got him.
c22089 +++$+++ Slow down.
c22089 +++$+++ Don't crowd him.
c04025 +++$+++ Shit!
c04025 +++$+++ Hi.
c04025 +++$+++ Hi.
c04025 +++$+++ I thought I could give you a lift back.
c04025 +++$+++ Are you coming home?
c04025 +++$+++ My house?
c20208 +++$+++ Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
c20208 +++$+++ You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
c20208 +++$+++ Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
c20208 +++$+++ I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
c20208 +++$+++ Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
c20208 +++$+++ Yes, I gathered as much.
c20208 +++$+++ And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
c20208 +++$+++ Yes.
c20208 +++$+++ And that appears to have been destroyed. It also contained the anti-virus, Bellerophon.
c20208 +++$+++ Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only really effective against Chimera.
c20208 +++$+++ By fire.  That's the best way, really.
c25913 +++$+++ I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
c25913 +++$+++ What for?
c25913 +++$+++ I'm going back home with Harry.
c25913 +++$+++ I've heard some foolish things in my life.
c25913 +++$+++ Harry is coming to pick me up.
c25913 +++$+++ Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
c25913 +++$+++ I'm busy.
c25913 +++$+++ Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
c25913 +++$+++ I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough.  You sit right there with your no manners self.
c15535 +++$+++ I got the rap sheets on the black guys, sir.  Coates and Jones got charges a mile long.  But except for some kid stuff, Fontaine's clean.
c15535 +++$+++ Clean?
c15535 +++$+++ Until he gunned down six people.
c03012 +++$+++ Wait. When are you going to tell them?
c03012 +++$+++ Tell them? About...
c03012 +++$+++ Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
c03012 +++$+++ Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
c03012 +++$+++ Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
c03012 +++$+++ Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
c04998 +++$+++ Who's it for? A relative?
c04998 +++$+++ Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
c04998 +++$+++ They ran his name and got a hit. He's been in before.
c11824 +++$+++ What are you an idiot!
c11824 +++$+++ The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
c11824 +++$+++ Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
c22582 +++$+++ Are you sick, Mama?
c22582 +++$+++ No, Estellita.
c22582 +++$+++ Later. When I finish the ironing.
c07716 +++$+++ Your portable reed organ....the piano.
c07716 +++$+++ Well, it's fine. Thank you.
c07716 +++$+++ Did you pick it up from the street?
c07716 +++$+++ What?
c07716 +++$+++ Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
c07716 +++$+++ ...yes I did...?
c07716 +++$+++ Are you learning how to play it?
c07716 +++$+++ Yes? I'm trying.
c07716 +++$+++ Oh that's great.
c07716 +++$+++ Yes no not really.
c21037 +++$+++ Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
c21037 +++$+++ Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
c21037 +++$+++ I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
c21037 +++$+++ A vote is before the group.
c21037 +++$+++ Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
c11937 +++$+++ Well... THIS.
c11937 +++$+++ You wrote his scripts for him?
c11937 +++$+++ Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
c11937 +++$+++ You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his - what about before that?
c11937 +++$+++ Before Bill came to Hollywood.
c01921 +++$+++ I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
c01921 +++$+++ No.
c01921 +++$+++ Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
c01921 +++$+++ But what about us?
c01921 +++$+++ We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
c01921 +++$+++ And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
c18177 +++$+++ I don't know, Ms. Jenzen.
c18177 +++$+++ Well, who's the damn thing <u>from</u>?
c18177 +++$+++ Messenger just dropped it off. No return address.
c18177 +++$+++ You didn't think to ask?
c18177 +++$+++ -- being utterly fucking useless, what else is new.
c20376 +++$+++ Which one of us is she flirting with?
c20376 +++$+++ The good-looking one.
c20376 +++$+++ You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
c02764 +++$+++ Aren't you ever going back?
c02764 +++$+++ ...Not if I can help it.
c02764 +++$+++ Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
c02764 +++$+++ What about your husband?
c18552 +++$+++ Not bad -- that's a real fast lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the diffusion, though....
c18552 +++$+++ What else you got?
c18552 +++$+++ Let's see -- you got a minute?
c18552 +++$+++ Okay, okay -- stand over there....
c25581 +++$+++ Wes, we thought you were dead, and we thought we were next.  Hanging around to get killed wouldn't have done anyone any good.
c25581 +++$+++ Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
c25581 +++$+++ Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
c15787 +++$+++ An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
c15787 +++$+++ It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
c15787 +++$+++ And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
c15787 +++$+++ Yeah.
c15787 +++$+++ I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
c03246 +++$+++ Hi... what's your name?
c03246 +++$+++ Norman.
c03246 +++$+++ ...are you waiting for a bus?
c03246 +++$+++ Yes.
c03246 +++$+++ You don't know what you're talking about.
c23131 +++$+++ -- Anyway.
c23131 +++$+++ I hope she's all right.
c23131 +++$+++ She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
c23131 +++$+++ I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
c23131 +++$+++ No, I know.
c23131 +++$+++ And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
c23131 +++$+++ I know.
c23131 +++$+++ That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
c07054 +++$+++ It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
c07054 +++$+++ Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
c07054 +++$+++ This is not a joke, John!
c07054 +++$+++ We should set up a Cuban defense fund on this; take care of all of them.
c23114 +++$+++ Don't you think there's too much gold?
c23114 +++$+++ It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
c23114 +++$+++ I don't know, I think...
c23114 +++$+++ No.
c11682 +++$+++ Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
c11682 +++$+++ I'll take a bus.
c11682 +++$+++ I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
c11747 +++$+++ Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
c11747 +++$+++ I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
c11747 +++$+++ So?
c19941 +++$+++ What's it like?
c19941 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c19941 +++$+++ What's it like where I'm going?
c19941 +++$+++ Can you keep a secret?
c19941 +++$+++ So can I.
c26148 +++$+++ What?
c26148 +++$+++ Do you still love your husband?
c26148 +++$+++ Yes.
c26148 +++$+++ I love him.  I have always loved him and I will always love him.  Can I go home, please?
c13174 +++$+++ I really have to go.
c13174 +++$+++ Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
c13174 +++$+++ What?
c13174 +++$+++ Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
c13174 +++$+++ My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen.  Hey, and from now on, so do you.
c06944 +++$+++ You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
c06944 +++$+++ No.
c06944 +++$+++ They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
c06944 +++$+++ Instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I'm gonna make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special, like a poem or song.  They get all their art literature from dreams. Just wake up and write it down. Dream skills.
c25892 +++$+++ ... Do you have a gun?
c25892 +++$+++ What?
c25892 +++$+++ You heard me. A gun?  I left mine in the car.
c25892 +++$+++ Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
c17156 +++$+++ You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
c17156 +++$+++ We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
c17156 +++$+++ My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
c17156 +++$+++ The money was sent.
c17156 +++$+++ Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
c17156 +++$+++ Except the President of the United States.
c05614 +++$+++ Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
c05614 +++$+++ It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
c05614 +++$+++ I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
c05614 +++$+++ For everything.
c05614 +++$+++ Good.  I was hoping for that.
c21375 +++$+++ . Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
c21375 +++$+++ Charlie? Was I dead?
c21375 +++$+++ I thought you were...for a while.
c21375 +++$+++ You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
c21375 +++$+++ But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
c21375 +++$+++ Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
c21375 +++$+++ I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
c21375 +++$+++ That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.
c14792 +++$+++ You wanna get some coffee?
c14792 +++$+++ I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
c14792 +++$+++ Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
c14792 +++$+++ No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
c14792 +++$+++ Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
c14792 +++$+++ So what book did you buy?
c14792 +++$+++ Oh, it's nothing.
c14792 +++$+++ No really, I love knowing what people read.
c14792 +++$+++ I can forgive you a bestseller.
c04283 +++$+++ Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
c04283 +++$+++ His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
c04283 +++$+++ Oh, right.
c04283 +++$+++ Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
c23519 +++$+++ I think you testified <u>all</u> the lights were on.  Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
c23519 +++$+++ Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
c23519 +++$+++ And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
c23519 +++$+++ Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
c23519 +++$+++ Does it now?
c23519 +++$+++ You have to wonder.
c21830 +++$+++ I want to duel him left-handed.
c21830 +++$+++ You know what a hurry we're in.
c21830 +++$+++ Oh, have it your way.
c18415 +++$+++ Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
c18415 +++$+++ What you are? You would be something other than you are?
c18415 +++$+++ And if I cut my hair again?
c18415 +++$+++ But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
c03637 +++$+++ You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
c03637 +++$+++ The long end. Big con.
c03637 +++$+++ Nobody does that single-o.
c03637 +++$+++ I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
c03637 +++$+++ I've heard the name.
c03637 +++$+++ It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
c03637 +++$+++ It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
c04984 +++$+++ Who was that?
c04984 +++$+++ That was Beaumont.
c04984 +++$+++ Who was Beaumont?
c04984 +++$+++ An employee I had to let go.
c04984 +++$+++ What did he do?
c04984 +++$+++ He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
c04984 +++$+++ Yeah.
c04984 +++$+++ I follow.
c05176 +++$+++ Uh, hi Su-Chin.
c05176 +++$+++ Oh, hi Juno. How are you?
c05176 +++$+++ Good. I'm good.  Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
c05176 +++$+++ No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
c05176 +++$+++ You should try Adderall.
c05176 +++$+++ No thanks. I'm off pills.
c05176 +++$+++ Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
c05176 +++$+++ Well, it was nice seeing you.
c15090 +++$+++ Well -- what are we going to do?
c15090 +++$+++ We can still use my butter money.
c15090 +++$+++ Your butter money?
c15090 +++$+++ Do you think I'm grudging it?
c15090 +++$+++ Mary -- it's gone.
c15090 +++$+++ Not all of it?
c15090 +++$+++ Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
c15090 +++$+++ It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
c15090 +++$+++ If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
c15090 +++$+++ Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
c15090 +++$+++ To save us work on the spring plowing?
c15090 +++$+++ You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
c15090 +++$+++ Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
c15090 +++$+++ I will, Mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that.
c08537 +++$+++ Elaine, it's Wednesday.
c08537 +++$+++ Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
c08537 +++$+++ As a matter-of-fact I am.
c08537 +++$+++ When is she coming over?
c08537 +++$+++ I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
c12322 +++$+++ ... What do you make of all this?
c12322 +++$+++ I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
c12322 +++$+++ ... Yeah...
c12322 +++$+++ Well... He's either very, very bright or very, very dense - he's hard to figure...  ... Let's just keep everything legal.
c13354 +++$+++ Look at yours.
c13354 +++$+++ What?
c13354 +++$+++ Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
c13354 +++$+++ It's like everything else in this place. You don't do it yourself, it never gets done.
c18445 +++$+++ Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
c18445 +++$+++ What about a radio?
c18445 +++$+++ Sorry. Emergencies only.
c18445 +++$+++ I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
c24825 +++$+++ Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
c24825 +++$+++ I don't know.
c24825 +++$+++ It was a stupid thing to do.
c24825 +++$+++ It was.
c24825 +++$+++ Welcome Home.
c24825 +++$+++ Sure.
c16820 +++$+++ Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
c16820 +++$+++ I hear Alan's sick.
c16820 +++$+++ Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
c16820 +++$+++ You know about Adele.
c16820 +++$+++ What about her?
c16820 +++$+++ She's dying.
c16820 +++$+++ She died.
c16820 +++$+++ I talked to her two days ago.
c16820 +++$+++ Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
c16820 +++$+++ Our Peter?
c16820 +++$+++ Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
c16820 +++$+++ Can he get through it?
c16820 +++$+++ They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
c16820 +++$+++ I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
c16820 +++$+++ That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
c16820 +++$+++ About what?
c16820 +++$+++ Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
c16820 +++$+++ Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
c16820 +++$+++ Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
c16820 +++$+++ They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
c16820 +++$+++ What?
c16820 +++$+++ The Red Sox
c16820 +++$+++ You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
c16820 +++$+++ It can't be all that personal.
c22304 +++$+++ You son-of-a-bitch...
c22304 +++$+++ What?
c22304 +++$+++ You speak French.
c22304 +++$+++ Nothing...
c12225 +++$+++ I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
c12225 +++$+++ This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
c12225 +++$+++ I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
c17507 +++$+++ I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
c17507 +++$+++ That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
c17507 +++$+++ How did you find out all that?
c20755 +++$+++ Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
c20755 +++$+++ Yeah, we have a van.
c20755 +++$+++ Where's it parked?
c20755 +++$+++ Let me have the keys.
c13924 +++$+++ It was in Chinatown.
c13924 +++$+++ What were you doing there?
c13924 +++$+++ Doing what?
c05610 +++$+++ This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
c05610 +++$+++ Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
c05610 +++$+++ All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
c05610 +++$+++ Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects.  It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.
c09088 +++$+++ No... the door's too thick.
c09088 +++$+++ Then we'll just have to assume it's still there...
c09088 +++$+++ Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
c17768 +++$+++ Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
c17768 +++$+++ Not with any certainty we...
c17768 +++$+++ Why did he come back?
c17768 +++$+++ Our operatives in Brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
c17768 +++$+++ ...WHY DID HE COME BACK?  WHY DID THE BOY TURN BACK...?
c17768 +++$+++ ...are you alright, sir...?
c17768 +++$+++ HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have we Seen it Before.
c17768 +++$+++ The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why? Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS. IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As Lechter will return back.  You see?  To the sight of his oppressor <u>wounded</u>. He will return to savage our beloved Miss Starling.  Bring me a drink.
c10528 +++$+++ How ya doing?
c10528 +++$+++ Fine.
c10528 +++$+++ Good.
c10528 +++$+++ I just brought you something to eat.
c07243 +++$+++ What are you doing?
c07243 +++$+++ He has no heartbeat!
c07243 +++$+++ You're hurting him!!
c07243 +++$+++ I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
c07243 +++$+++ LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
c21372 +++$+++ What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
c21372 +++$+++ I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
c21372 +++$+++ You're going to listen to me.
c16348 +++$+++ I think everything's okay here.
c16348 +++$+++ I could check your prostate.
c16348 +++$+++ Well... thanks, anyway.
c17533 +++$+++ So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
c17533 +++$+++ Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
c17533 +++$+++ When are you coming home?
c17533 +++$+++ You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
c17533 +++$+++ Okay.
c25355 +++$+++ Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
c25355 +++$+++ How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
c25355 +++$+++ So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
c06761 +++$+++ Everything's going exactly as we planned.
c06761 +++$+++ Not quite. You haven't announced our engagement yet.
c06761 +++$+++ It must have slipped my mind.
c06761 +++$+++ Don't worry, Pootchkie. My womanizing days are over. You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole.  We're such an incredible team. Who could possibly stop us?
c03565 +++$+++ Miss Flaemm.
c03565 +++$+++ Hello!
c03565 +++$+++ I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
c03565 +++$+++ It's urgent.
c21368 +++$+++ I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
c21368 +++$+++ I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
c21368 +++$+++ Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love ---- Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
c21368 +++$+++ You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
c21368 +++$+++ You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
c21368 +++$+++ And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
c21368 +++$+++ Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
c21368 +++$+++ Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
c21368 +++$+++ I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
c21368 +++$+++ That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
c21368 +++$+++ What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
c21368 +++$+++ I just can't trust you anymore.
c21368 +++$+++ What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
c21368 +++$+++ That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
c21368 +++$+++ But what has to be different?
c21368 +++$+++ Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
c21368 +++$+++ What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
c21368 +++$+++ You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.  ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian!
c13111 +++$+++ My Lord mother man, you look like hell. What were you drinking?
c13111 +++$+++ The captain almost fired me tonight. I'm on my way out. Anytime now.
c13111 +++$+++ Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
c13111 +++$+++ The ghosts--
c13111 +++$+++ You ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
c13111 +++$+++ It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here.
c00101 +++$+++ Don't you guys understand?  It's all about image.  The better we look the more money I get to pay you guys overtime.
c00101 +++$+++ Yeah, right.
c00101 +++$+++ What was that, Korfin?
c00101 +++$+++ You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
c09100 +++$+++ Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
c09100 +++$+++ I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
c09100 +++$+++ Too bad.  Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
c22339 +++$+++ I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
c22339 +++$+++ How the hell did he find it?
c22339 +++$+++ He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
c22339 +++$+++ Great...
c22339 +++$+++ It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
c22339 +++$+++ Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
c22339 +++$+++ Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
c22339 +++$+++ I know.
c22339 +++$+++ Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
c22339 +++$+++ He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
c22339 +++$+++ I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
c21546 +++$+++ Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
c21546 +++$+++ Fuck you bitch.
c21546 +++$+++ Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me Junior.
c12989 +++$+++ I won't ask again.
c12989 +++$+++ I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
c12989 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c12989 +++$+++ Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
c12989 +++$+++ ...which one are you?...
c10968 +++$+++ This is Chaz.
c10968 +++$+++ Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
c10968 +++$+++ What's up?
c10968 +++$+++ I'm on my way.
c25712 +++$+++ But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
c25712 +++$+++ You think that's too much?
c25712 +++$+++ That sounds sensible.
c23450 +++$+++ They're all the same.
c23450 +++$+++ That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
c23450 +++$+++ I've never seen anything like it.
c23450 +++$+++ It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
c23450 +++$+++ Amazing.  I'm not sure I get it, though. I mean, how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project?
c23450 +++$+++ I don't know, it just came to me. It's my corner, after all. It's just one little part of the world, but things happen there, too, just like everywhere else. It's a record of my little spot.
c23450 +++$+++ It's kind of overwhelming.
c23450 +++$+++ You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
c23450 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c23450 +++$+++ I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
c23450 +++$+++ But they're all the same.
c23450 +++$+++ They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
c23450 +++$+++ Yeah, that's what I'd recommend. You know how it is. Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, time creeps on its petty pace.
c22632 +++$+++ But... why? Why would you pretend?
c22632 +++$+++ I can't tell you.
c22632 +++$+++ You don't trust me?
c22632 +++$+++ And you want me to do you some big favor?
c25530 +++$+++ Who's that man?
c25530 +++$+++ He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
c25530 +++$+++ I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
c25530 +++$+++ This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
c25530 +++$+++ I don't like him.
c25530 +++$+++ Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
c25530 +++$+++ No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
c25530 +++$+++ What bonds?
c25530 +++$+++ The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
c25530 +++$+++ Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
c25530 +++$+++ I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
c25530 +++$+++ Don't you remember....
c25530 +++$+++ Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
c25530 +++$+++ Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
c25530 +++$+++ No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
c25530 +++$+++ What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
c25530 +++$+++ supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
c10304 +++$+++ Kim got busted at 19 for burglary. At 20 he was convicted in the shooting death of a young Chinese gang lord... The prosecution claimed Kim did it to get into "the Joe Boys"?
c10304 +++$+++ Chinatown street gang.
c10304 +++$+++ -- The Nazi he knifed?
c21925 +++$+++ I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?
c21925 +++$+++ Yes.
c21925 +++$+++ I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
c21925 +++$+++ Just an expression...  What I meant was... I'd do just about anything... to get away.  Wouldn't you?
c13951 +++$+++ Yeah? Ain't that something? Middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. Only in L.A.
c13951 +++$+++ Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
c13951 +++$+++ So how are you, Morty?
c07151 +++$+++ Maybe I'll go ridin.
c07151 +++$+++ Okay.
c07151 +++$+++ What do you think.
c07151 +++$+++ I can't plan your day.
c07151 +++$+++ Lord no. I'm not retired.
c04387 +++$+++ Have a nice trip?
c04387 +++$+++ Fair.
c04387 +++$+++ Can I sit down?
c04387 +++$+++ Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
c04387 +++$+++ Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
c04387 +++$+++ Can I buy you another drink?
c26046 +++$+++ It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
c26046 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c26046 +++$+++ Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
c26046 +++$+++ Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
c26046 +++$+++ No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
c26046 +++$+++ So who else?
c26046 +++$+++ OK, OK, so what's the point you're trying to make?
c12157 +++$+++ Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.
c12157 +++$+++ Take me. Let the boy go.
c12157 +++$+++ Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
c12157 +++$+++ Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
c27052 +++$+++ No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
c27052 +++$+++ STEPHANIE?
c27052 +++$+++ My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
c27052 +++$+++ STEPHANIE loved me - she got some insurance money and took legal custody of me - she was just old enough. We had a ball for years - we could do anything, anywhere, anyhow...And we did...We would play games - she would be the executioner and I would be the convict - She would strap me into the arm chair and pretend to electrocute me...
c15738 +++$+++ I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
c15738 +++$+++ Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows?  Check, please.
c15738 +++$+++ I don't want to waste your time.
c15738 +++$+++ I have a proposal for you.
c17714 +++$+++ Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
c17714 +++$+++ Really?
c17714 +++$+++ Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
c17714 +++$+++ Oh...
c17714 +++$+++ Like what?
c21820 +++$+++ There was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. They were both masters.
c21820 +++$+++ Who won? How did it end?
c21820 +++$+++ The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
c21820 +++$+++ The loser is nothing. -- Only the Princess matters --  -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of Guilder. We must be ready for whatever lies ahead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.
c01391 +++$+++ Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
c01391 +++$+++ Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
c01391 +++$+++ And you gonna live it with him?
c13417 +++$+++ The arrangement is over!
c13417 +++$+++ No kidding. NO KIDDING!
c13417 +++$+++ I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!  I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
c24847 +++$+++ This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
c24847 +++$+++ Terry Valentine.
c24847 +++$+++ I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine.
c22966 +++$+++ Talk!
c22966 +++$+++ A young buck fetched it in late last summer...  Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
c22966 +++$+++ Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
c22966 +++$+++ Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
c22966 +++$+++ Keep talking.
c22966 +++$+++ Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
c22966 +++$+++ In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
c16249 +++$+++ Who, me? Oh, no! Don't bother about me! We're not hurt! Isn't that right, Skipper?
c16249 +++$+++ Uh -- what?
c16249 +++$+++ We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
c16249 +++$+++ Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
c18761 +++$+++ --  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
c18761 +++$+++ Mmm.  Hmm.
c18761 +++$+++ It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
c18761 +++$+++ Here it is.  "Show me the money."  Show.  Me.  The.  Money. _ 36.
c08965 +++$+++ What are you looking at?
c08965 +++$+++ The Admiral's son.
c08965 +++$+++ Oh, I believe it.
c11648 +++$+++ They think you're in Fairbanks. If not, they still won't find you before the plane comes tomorrow.
c11648 +++$+++ Don't bet on it.
c11648 +++$+++ You don't know how true that is.
c23718 +++$+++ Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
c23718 +++$+++ Oh yeah...
c23718 +++$+++ Oh yeah...
c23718 +++$+++ Oh Sara...
c23718 +++$+++ Anna...
c09118 +++$+++ You deny Enterprise fired on KRONOS One?
c09118 +++$+++ Well, I -
c09118 +++$+++ You deny that your men beamed aboard KRONOS One and shot the Chancellor?
c09118 +++$+++ I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
c09118 +++$+++ Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
c09118 +++$+++ So if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?
c07805 +++$+++ I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
c07805 +++$+++ Do you?
c07805 +++$+++ Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
c07805 +++$+++ So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind of sad future are we two making? A future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? A future where no price is too high for fame and power? When we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard?
c12534 +++$+++ These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
c12534 +++$+++ Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
c12534 +++$+++ Perhaps.
c12664 +++$+++ Everything okay?
c12664 +++$+++ Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
c12664 +++$+++ No.
c08000 +++$+++ You cold?
c08000 +++$+++ Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
c08000 +++$+++ I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
c08000 +++$+++ Neither can I.
c08000 +++$+++ No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
c08000 +++$+++ Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What?  You still here?" Man!
c00510 +++$+++ There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
c00510 +++$+++ I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
c00510 +++$+++ Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
c06938 +++$+++ She run off with a drummer one night. Durin' prayer-meetin'.
c06938 +++$+++ Where's she at?
c06938 +++$+++ Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
c06938 +++$+++ She took them kids with her?
c06938 +++$+++ Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
c18849 +++$+++ Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau.
c18849 +++$+++ No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
c18849 +++$+++ I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
c18849 +++$+++ For a further three years.
c08130 +++$+++ Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
c08130 +++$+++ Why do you think?
c08130 +++$+++ Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
c14490 +++$+++ Shocking, huh?
c14490 +++$+++ Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
c14490 +++$+++ I wish I could have seen that.
c14490 +++$+++ My Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light.  But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones.
c08387 +++$+++ Are you a writer too?
c08387 +++$+++ No, I'm an actor.
c08387 +++$+++ Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
c08387 +++$+++ A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
c08387 +++$+++ Maybe. Recognize this?
c20543 +++$+++ Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
c20543 +++$+++ No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
c20543 +++$+++ That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
c20106 +++$+++ There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months...
c20106 +++$+++ That doesn't seem so bad.
c20106 +++$+++ But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
c20106 +++$+++ Aslan, there...
c16876 +++$+++ He was afraid of being exposed.  That's why he did it.
c16876 +++$+++ It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  You've seen their security system.  They know who works there.  Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
c16876 +++$+++ Don't underestimate these imposters.
c16876 +++$+++ A man can change his face--but blood is forever. Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.  Intravenous.
c16259 +++$+++ ...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
c16259 +++$+++ Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
c16259 +++$+++ What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
c16259 +++$+++ So why don't you just ask him for the money?
c25681 +++$+++ The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
c25681 +++$+++ No!
c25681 +++$+++ That's just what I tried to tell him. Well, one word led to another. He really was a very charming fellow. So we talked for about ten minutes.
c00368 +++$+++ The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
c00368 +++$+++ Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
c00368 +++$+++ -- the bad news is there's a problem with Gordon's truck what somebody drove through the ice last night. Figured you'd know something about that, Wade.
c00368 +++$+++ Yeah. I know about that.
c00368 +++$+++ LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
c00368 +++$+++ Tell me.
c00368 +++$+++ Chub says you're fired.
c00368 +++$+++ He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
c22602 +++$+++ What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
c22602 +++$+++ I thought maybe you forgot...
c22602 +++$+++ It's Mama's Saint's Day.
c21125 +++$+++ This is a Lifestyles hotel.
c21125 +++$+++ What?
c21125 +++$+++ "Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
c21125 +++$+++ Are you sure?
c21125 +++$+++ Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
c25928 +++$+++ How many people do you all feed?
c25928 +++$+++ Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
c25928 +++$+++ Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
c25928 +++$+++ Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't.  You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste.
c10763 +++$+++ When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
c10763 +++$+++ Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
c10763 +++$+++ No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
c10763 +++$+++ In your mind, Walter. Take your time.
c20752 +++$+++ Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
c20752 +++$+++ What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
c20752 +++$+++ What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
c20752 +++$+++ Do you miss Mallory?
c20752 +++$+++ Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
c20752 +++$+++ Then was it worth it?
c20752 +++$+++ Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
c22000 +++$+++ There goes Mother.
c22000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c22000 +++$+++ Okay.
c17428 +++$+++ Where you going?
c17428 +++$+++ California.
c17428 +++$+++ How long you plan to be in Arizona?
c17428 +++$+++ No longer'n we can get acrost her.
c17428 +++$+++ Got any plants?
c17428 +++$+++ No plants.
c17428 +++$+++ Sure. We aim to.
c02926 +++$+++ Yes?
c02926 +++$+++ Did you hear?
c02926 +++$+++ Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws.
c14053 +++$+++ Wait a second? Who was working here today?
c14053 +++$+++ Just me.
c14053 +++$+++ I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral.
c14053 +++$+++ We did.
c14053 +++$+++ Then who operated the store?
c14053 +++$+++ Nobody. It was closed.
c14053 +++$+++ Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
c07084 +++$+++ Are you tapping Kissinger?
c07084 +++$+++ My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
c07084 +++$+++ Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
c07084 +++$+++ It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
c07084 +++$+++ Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
c07084 +++$+++ ... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
c07084 +++$+++ Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
c24552 +++$+++ It's the only logical conclusion. If he remains here, he'll be as dead as...
c24552 +++$+++ -- as we will be.
c24552 +++$+++ Lara, please...
c24552 +++$+++ But why Earth, Jor-El. They're practically animals.
c24552 +++$+++ They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
c24552 +++$+++ A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
c24552 +++$+++ Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
c24552 +++$+++ He'll be weightless.
c24552 +++$+++ Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
c24552 +++$+++ Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
c13561 +++$+++ Now I have -- it's a long story.
c13561 +++$+++ Why didn't you just shoot them?
c13561 +++$+++ Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
c13561 +++$+++ You're going to let them get away with this?
c13561 +++$+++ We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
c13561 +++$+++ They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
c13561 +++$+++ So far they're keeping their part of it.
c13561 +++$+++ Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.  It's all there isn't it?
c04989 +++$+++ You shot Melanie?
c04989 +++$+++ Twice. In the parking lot.
c04989 +++$+++ Couldn't talk to her?
c04989 +++$+++ You know how she is.
c04989 +++$+++ You couldn't just hit her?
c04989 +++$+++ Maybe... but at that moment... I dunno...
c04989 +++$+++ You shot her twice?
c04989 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c04989 +++$+++ So you're sure she's dead.
c04989 +++$+++ Pretty sure.
c04989 +++$+++ Where did you shoot her?
c04989 +++$+++ Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.
c11305 +++$+++ M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
c11305 +++$+++ As Balzac said...
c11305 +++$+++ H'm?
c11305 +++$+++ "There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
c11305 +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
c11305 +++$+++ Yeah.
c11305 +++$+++ Yeah?
c11305 +++$+++ Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
c11305 +++$+++ No.  You're a wreck.
c11305 +++$+++ Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
c11305 +++$+++ You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
c11305 +++$+++ Good? I was-
c11305 +++$+++ No.
c11305 +++$+++ No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
c11305 +++$+++ Here, you want some?
c11305 +++$+++ No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
c11305 +++$+++ Yeah?
c11305 +++$+++ I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
c11305 +++$+++ Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
c11305 +++$+++ What? What?
c23544 +++$+++ Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
c23544 +++$+++ Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
c23544 +++$+++ You tore it again!
c26788 +++$+++ Remember a few years ago when music schools were using a computerized teaching tool that accidently started frying kids' brains?
c26788 +++$+++ I've been in prison, remember?
c26788 +++$+++ Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
c12272 +++$+++ Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
c12272 +++$+++ Yes. I was.
c12272 +++$+++ I'm sorry...  ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
c12272 +++$+++ Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
c12272 +++$+++ Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
c12272 +++$+++ Of course.
c00348 +++$+++ Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
c00348 +++$+++ Had kind of a long night.
c00348 +++$+++ No, the Dan part was nice...
c04633 +++$+++ Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
c04633 +++$+++ Alright.
c04633 +++$+++ I'll call you then.
c20345 +++$+++ Come and see the violence inherent in the system. Help, help, I'm being repressed!
c20345 +++$+++ Bloody peasant!
c20345 +++$+++ Come on, patsy.
c18309 +++$+++ Does she suffer?  Does she know what she is?
c18309 +++$+++ I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
c18309 +++$+++ Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
c12128 +++$+++ ...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
c12128 +++$+++ I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
c12128 +++$+++ Why's that?
c12128 +++$+++ Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
c12128 +++$+++ I didn't know that. See? You _are_ interesting. And call me Chase. By the way, do you have a first name? Or do I just call you bats?
c25705 +++$+++ Eysee seven, eight, nine, two.  We have to clear out.  Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
c25705 +++$+++ He recognized you!
c25705 +++$+++ No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you.
c25705 +++$+++ Spanish passports?
c25705 +++$+++ Correct. Now the train leaves--
c25705 +++$+++ At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
c25705 +++$+++ Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
c25705 +++$+++ Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Dona Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
c25705 +++$+++ I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late!
c25705 +++$+++ Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
c25705 +++$+++ By the way, how is your German?
c25705 +++$+++ <u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
c25705 +++$+++ <u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
c25705 +++$+++ <u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
c25705 +++$+++ <u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
c03900 +++$+++ Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
c03900 +++$+++ Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
c03900 +++$+++ Well, it's a tricky turn.
c03900 +++$+++ Eh, yes, ma'm.
c03900 +++$+++ Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
c03900 +++$+++ Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
c17170 +++$+++ This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here.  Someone who's done things with his life.
c17170 +++$+++ Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
c17170 +++$+++ It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
c17170 +++$+++ It never crossed your mind?
c17170 +++$+++ All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
c21140 +++$+++ He's a jerk.
c21140 +++$+++ Yes.  He is.
c21140 +++$+++ I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
c21140 +++$+++ Yup.
c21140 +++$+++ When you could've found one in America.
c24005 +++$+++ Have you got the new pages on the Old Mill?  Hey, Bob.
c24005 +++$+++ Hey, Tommy.  Heard your wife's having a baby.
c24005 +++$+++ That's right.
c24005 +++$+++ You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
c24005 +++$+++ That Could Be.
c02393 +++$+++ Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
c02393 +++$+++ You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
c02393 +++$+++ Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
c02393 +++$+++ Nothing of any importance, eh?
c02415 +++$+++ Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
c02415 +++$+++ Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
c02415 +++$+++ HE'S GONE!
c02415 +++$+++ When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
c02415 +++$+++ YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
c02415 +++$+++ YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
c06582 +++$+++ That's him. Let him in.
c06582 +++$+++ Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
c06582 +++$+++ What do you think?
c06582 +++$+++ Jim, you can't come here and pull that steamroller stuff. Your methods won't do here. This boy is a Senator, however it happened, he's a Senator. This is Washington.
c06582 +++$+++ Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
c06582 +++$+++ Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
c06582 +++$+++ Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
c06582 +++$+++ Jim, I won't stand for it.
c06582 +++$+++ You won't stand for it?
c06582 +++$+++ I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
c06582 +++$+++ Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods are getting too hard to your sensitive soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver Knight is getting to big for us. My methods have been all right for the past twenty years, Joe, since I picked you out of a fly-specked hole in the wall and blew you up to look like a Senator, and now you can't stand it. Well, maybe you won't have to stand it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you and your Boy Ranger can go home together.
c06582 +++$+++ Jim, you don't have to--
c06582 +++$+++ Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
c06582 +++$+++ I'm glad to see you come to your senses. You had me scared there for a minute, thought.  Let him in.
c12333 +++$+++ I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
c12333 +++$+++ Yes, I did.
c12333 +++$+++ ... Well?
c12333 +++$+++ Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
c12333 +++$+++ Well, Ben... I...
c12333 +++$+++ That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.
c19016 +++$+++ Now, I'd advise you to wait outside.  It'll be eas--
c19016 +++$+++ No.
c19016 +++$+++ Fuck you.  He's my son.  I'm staying with him.
c11930 +++$+++ Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody figure this lighter out?
c11930 +++$+++ No, sir.  I think the flint...
c11930 +++$+++ What's happening with my call to SAC?
c11930 +++$+++ Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
c11930 +++$+++ Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
c11930 +++$+++ Should we be on Code Red?
c23087 +++$+++ Boy, am I glad to see you.
c23087 +++$+++ What are you doing here?
c23087 +++$+++ Your painful groin?
c01767 +++$+++ What do you mean get back?
c01767 +++$+++ Well, obviously, we got to go back.
c01767 +++$+++ Bob, that makes no sense.
c01767 +++$+++ Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
c01767 +++$+++ This could be a trap.
c01767 +++$+++ Come on, Dignan.
c01767 +++$+++ Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
c01767 +++$+++ I'm going back.
c01767 +++$+++ Not in that car you're not.
c01767 +++$+++ Good luck, since I got the keys.
c14698 +++$+++ Who the hell do you think you are?!
c14698 +++$+++ Excuse me.
c14698 +++$+++ I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
c14698 +++$+++ Is that so?
c16777 +++$+++ Why did you want her body?
c16777 +++$+++ For a good reason.
c16777 +++$+++ Tell me.
c16777 +++$+++ Sorry.
c16777 +++$+++ Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
c04394 +++$+++ Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
c04394 +++$+++ You want to go with me?
c04394 +++$+++ What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
c04394 +++$+++ Mm hmm.
c04394 +++$+++ You got it all in your head?
c04394 +++$+++ When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
c04394 +++$+++ I'm getting treatments right here.
c10181 +++$+++ Let's make it at eight.
c10181 +++$+++ Make what?
c10181 +++$+++ Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
c01615 +++$+++ Look.
c01615 +++$+++ No.
c01615 +++$+++ No. Please, Dorothy. Why are you in so much trouble?
c25475 +++$+++ What time you get off work here?
c25475 +++$+++ 2:00 A.M.
c25475 +++$+++ Yeh, sleepin'.
c18520 +++$+++ Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
c18520 +++$+++ Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
c18520 +++$+++ Some other time, George.
c18520 +++$+++ There's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm.
c04460 +++$+++ So, what do you do for a living?
c04460 +++$+++ I'm a dancer.
c04460 +++$+++ Really? Ballet?
c04460 +++$+++ No. Exotic.
c04460 +++$+++ Don't be. I'm not. It's good money.  'Side, he's worth it.
c19484 +++$+++ Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
c19484 +++$+++ She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
c19484 +++$+++ And?
c19484 +++$+++ And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
c19484 +++$+++ So she's honest.
c19484 +++$+++ Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
c19484 +++$+++ Didn't know you cared so much.
c19484 +++$+++ I don't.
c19484 +++$+++ Who's Spalding?
c14472 +++$+++ Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
c14472 +++$+++ You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
c14472 +++$+++ But what am I going to do?
c14472 +++$+++ I can't.    I can't see him there.
c10952 +++$+++ Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
c10952 +++$+++ Please, can I have one to surge with?
c10952 +++$+++ No.
c10952 +++$+++ No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
c10501 +++$+++ Heather Langenkamp?
c10501 +++$+++ Yes?
c10501 +++$+++ Is Chase Porter your husband?
c10501 +++$+++ I'm afraid there was an accident.  It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
c22080 +++$+++ What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
c22080 +++$+++ No.
c22080 +++$+++ General Jim Beam, then.
c22080 +++$+++ Oh.  Well.   I think it's pretty common knowledge that in the Battle of Little Big Horn, Custer was drunk off his ass.
c15467 +++$+++ Sign here, please.
c15467 +++$+++ That Ray was a pig. Ed is doll. You latch on to him honey.
c15467 +++$+++ By the X.
c15467 +++$+++ Some more make-up wouldn't do you any harm. On TV you look a little washed out.
c15467 +++$+++ What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
c15467 +++$+++ By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X.
c17505 +++$+++ How long did you live here with your wife?
c17505 +++$+++ Five years. My son was born here.
c17505 +++$+++ Son?
c17505 +++$+++ Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
c17505 +++$+++ College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
c25923 +++$+++ Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
c25923 +++$+++ You remember that boy who lost his mind, Joe? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark. He wouldn't miss a one. Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe. He would pick up a brick and say "go on in there brick and hit somebody" and it would find its mark.
c25923 +++$+++ All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
c07641 +++$+++ I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
c07641 +++$+++ "Changes."
c07641 +++$+++ "Changes."  And it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. It's little things.  Did you hear about Bill Miller?
c07641 +++$+++ No. What?
c07641 +++$+++ One of those ... big beds?
c05185 +++$+++ So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
c05185 +++$+++ Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
c05185 +++$+++ Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
c03874 +++$+++ I like Glaucus.
c03874 +++$+++ Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
c03874 +++$+++ Well, I really don't smoke.
c03874 +++$+++ It's all right.  It's organic.
c03874 +++$+++ I'm sure picking up on vices.
c03874 +++$+++ Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
c03874 +++$+++ Did Confucius say that?
c03874 +++$+++ Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
c03874 +++$+++ You are the wisest person I know.
c03874 +++$+++ Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
c03874 +++$+++ Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
c03874 +++$+++ What was that?
c03874 +++$+++ Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
c03874 +++$+++ How ingenious! Tell me about them.
c03874 +++$+++ Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
c03874 +++$+++ Okay.
c01703 +++$+++ Why?
c01703 +++$+++ As part of his plan. I don't know why.
c01703 +++$+++ See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
c01703 +++$+++ The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
c01703 +++$+++ What does Starsky say?
c01703 +++$+++ He says. This is he.
c01703 +++$+++ No. This is he.
c13646 +++$+++ Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
c13646 +++$+++ Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
c13646 +++$+++ Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
c19866 +++$+++ Teresa?...Yeah, Charlie.  Listen, I'm looking for your cousin.  Yeah, well today's Tuesday, payday.  I haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  I know it's early yet but I'm just getting worried that's all...
c19866 +++$+++ Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
c19866 +++$+++ But...
c26137 +++$+++ Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
c26137 +++$+++ You tell on me, I tell on you.
c26137 +++$+++ Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
c26137 +++$+++ You know about that?
c03179 +++$+++ Not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to Russia.
c03179 +++$+++ He'll sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
c03179 +++$+++ I must be in the wrong business.
c03179 +++$+++ Better than "making hamburger for Mickey D."
c08925 +++$+++ Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
c08925 +++$+++ Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
c08925 +++$+++ I'll try to remember that, Captain.
c05191 +++$+++ Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
c05191 +++$+++ I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
c05191 +++$+++ Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
c05191 +++$+++ Eww, he's all beardy!
c12607 +++$+++ ...I thought you were dead. Going home?
c12607 +++$+++ No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
c12607 +++$+++ Meurice...
c05131 +++$+++ I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
c05131 +++$+++ Transplants?
c05131 +++$+++ -- and an America's Cup Trials...
c05131 +++$+++ I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
c05131 +++$+++ Are you now. I know about porkers in the water --  Here. Tie me a sheepshank.
c19038 +++$+++ The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
c19038 +++$+++ I accept it. What is suffering?
c19038 +++$+++ True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
c19038 +++$+++ The causes of suffering arise from true sources. Attachment, desire, envy, hatred, greed, unkindness, wrong view and so forth -- these are some causes of suffering.
c04700 +++$+++ Hi.
c04700 +++$+++ Hello Marylin.
c04700 +++$+++ I bet.
c20196 +++$+++ Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
c20196 +++$+++ This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
c20196 +++$+++ Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest.
c26753 +++$+++ How much is that?
c26753 +++$+++ Fifteen yards.
c26753 +++$+++ That's fifteen by seven?
c26753 +++$+++ Good.
c11231 +++$+++ Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
c11231 +++$+++ What?!  How do I do that?
c11231 +++$+++ Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
c11231 +++$+++ Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
c11231 +++$+++ That's good, that's what I needed to hear.  Now you qualify.
c11231 +++$+++ You've just inherited The Bible.
c00311 +++$+++ You... you need to go to the police.
c00311 +++$+++ I told you I can't, not yet.
c00311 +++$+++ You don't have any other choice.
c00311 +++$+++ No.  For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police.  I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
c00311 +++$+++ Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
c18313 +++$+++ I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.
c18313 +++$+++ I am not a frightened girl.
c18313 +++$+++ That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
c18313 +++$+++ If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
c18313 +++$+++ And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
c18313 +++$+++ Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
c18313 +++$+++ Of course not!
c15550 +++$+++ Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.
c15550 +++$+++ I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
c15550 +++$+++ Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
c15550 +++$+++ What?
c15550 +++$+++ You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.
c26798 +++$+++ You okay?
c26798 +++$+++ ...I think so...You?
c26798 +++$+++ More or less.
c26798 +++$+++ Lindenmeyer?
c26798 +++$+++ My guess is dead.
c26798 +++$+++ I don't know.
c05641 +++$+++ No one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
c05641 +++$+++ Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
c05641 +++$+++ I can die trying.
c18694 +++$+++ Why so coy about the word "frozen"?
c18694 +++$+++ Because, don't get into it ...
c18694 +++$+++ Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
c06446 +++$+++ Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,
c06446 +++$+++ The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
c06446 +++$+++ We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
c06446 +++$+++ Tommy Reina.
c12160 +++$+++ I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host.  Alexander Knox.
c12160 +++$+++ Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
c12160 +++$+++ I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
c06655 +++$+++ Huh? On, no. Nobody important.
c06655 +++$+++ Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
c06655 +++$+++ I'm a writer myself, you know.
c06279 +++$+++ I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.
c06279 +++$+++ I don't get it.
c06279 +++$+++ It was in the cava and the hole sealed itself off. I must have jiggled it just enough to turn it loose. I can't feel it in the heart or the right pulmonary artery. So it's in the left pulmonary artery.
c06279 +++$+++ What do we do?
c06279 +++$+++ We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
c06279 +++$+++ Sure, that's the right way... at John Hopkins or someplace. But how do we know there won't be even more of a jam-up a few days from now? Maybe we won't be able to get to him when we want to. Maybe the goddam thing'll erode the artery when nobody's looking. Our best shot is now.
c26581 +++$+++ Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
c26581 +++$+++ What?
c26581 +++$+++ You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
c26581 +++$+++ I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
c26581 +++$+++ ...he's a good man...
c26581 +++$+++ ...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
c26581 +++$+++ ...I have to stand up for her...
c26581 +++$+++ I have to try this case.  I have to do it, Mick.  I've got to stand up for that girl.  I need your help.    Mick, will you help me...?    Will you help me...?
c07176 +++$+++ ...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty.
c07176 +++$+++ I could come back then.
c07176 +++$+++ You said that.
c11893 +++$+++ You ever held another job before?
c11893 +++$+++ I used to throw trash for the City.
c11893 +++$+++ You lost that one?
c11893 +++$+++ Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
c11893 +++$+++ I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
c05649 +++$+++ You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
c05649 +++$+++ The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
c05649 +++$+++ Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
c05649 +++$+++ Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
c05649 +++$+++ One of you would end up dead.
c05649 +++$+++ At least we'll have a house to show for it.
c05649 +++$+++ Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
c05649 +++$+++ No, you don't.  Trust me.
c24834 +++$+++ Theo... Did you?
c24834 +++$+++ Maybe you did it yourself.
c24834 +++$+++ I don't know.  You've been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  Maybe he did it...
c16557 +++$+++ How does he look up close?
c16557 +++$+++ Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
c16557 +++$+++ A bad attitude.
c16557 +++$+++ You said before, that he got boxes?
c04847 +++$+++ Somebody planted that fucking story! And somebody tipped off the press I'm one of Garrison's fucking suspects.  I can't go home. I'm out on the street.  The maggots are everywhere!  Do you know what you've done to me?  It's all over the national news now.  You know what you've done to me?
c04847 +++$+++ Calm down, Dave, what?
c04847 +++$+++ I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe me, I'm a dead man.
c04847 +++$+++ What are you talking about, Dave? You weren't mentioned in the story. Don't jump to conclusions.
c04847 +++$+++ You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
c04847 +++$+++ What did they...
c04847 +++$+++ You still questioning any Cubans?
c04847 +++$+++ Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
c04847 +++$+++ It leads farther than that.
c04847 +++$+++ Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
c04847 +++$+++ The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?
c04847 +++$+++ Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
c04847 +++$+++ ...give me protection?
c04847 +++$+++ I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
c13669 +++$+++ You make a nice couple.
c13669 +++$+++ Don't I know it.
c13669 +++$+++ So what were you fucking around for, then?
c13669 +++$+++ You fuckers set me up. That bitch --
c13669 +++$+++ She's a friend of mine
c13669 +++$+++ What?
c07535 +++$+++ ... just like the mouse.
c07535 +++$+++ Mouse?  What mouse?
c07535 +++$+++ My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
c07535 +++$+++ I don't know.
c23860 +++$+++ Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
c23860 +++$+++ All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
c23860 +++$+++ For whoever's in that thing.
c04301 +++$+++ Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
c04301 +++$+++ Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
c04301 +++$+++ Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
c04301 +++$+++ No. I just got distracted. I'm so sorry.
c04301 +++$+++ Is everything fine?
c04301 +++$+++ Oui.  Now you've got me talking French.
c04301 +++$+++ I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?
c12451 +++$+++ Ahh, not so good, man.
c12451 +++$+++ One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
c12451 +++$+++ Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
c12451 +++$+++ Mm.
c12595 +++$+++ ...What're you gonna do in Houston?
c12595 +++$+++ I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
c12595 +++$+++ I told you. I like you.
c12595 +++$+++ See, I never knew that.
c12595 +++$+++ ...Hell.
c25522 +++$+++ Are you kidding?
c25522 +++$+++ No.
c25522 +++$+++ Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
c18976 +++$+++ Mom, I mean dad...
c18976 +++$+++ Uh huh...
c18976 +++$+++ That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
c18976 +++$+++ We use the green and yellow.
c21097 +++$+++ WAIT!!  Where are you?
c21097 +++$+++ I'm at the airport.  Why?
c21097 +++$+++ Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
c26852 +++$+++ Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...? Hel...?  I'm going to need an <u>ambulance</u>, we take him, the last moment, right from the Pl...no, <u>we</u> land, we puttem <u>in</u> the ambulance.  Air force jet lands, we take somebody <u>else</u> off <u>that</u> jet...what the fuck do <u>I</u> care? Somebody in a Hospital gown.  And we need a ......hello?  Hello...?
c26852 +++$+++ Cause I don't think <u>this</u> dog is gonna hunt....
c26852 +++$+++ He's going to be fine, aren't you boy...?
c26852 +++$+++ Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
c26852 +++$+++ It's an anti-psychotic, the num...  the number...hello...hello...
c09746 +++$+++ You and I should work together.
c09746 +++$+++ You mean we would sell the bodies to the doctors together? Dig them up?
c09746 +++$+++ No digging Joseph. The churchyards are too well guarded. We will "Burke" them,
c09746 +++$+++ Burke them?
c09746 +++$+++ You are lately come to Scotland, Joseph?
c09746 +++$+++ But still you may have heard the peddlers of verse cry out their names on the streets.
c13616 +++$+++ So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
c13616 +++$+++ Want to look after you.
c13616 +++$+++ Something I heard someone say once.
c12554 +++$+++ <u>This</u> is what you wanted enhanced?
c12554 +++$+++ Yeah.
c12554 +++$+++ You mind me asking: why the fuck?
c12554 +++$+++ Looks like a rope.
c12244 +++$+++ Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
c12244 +++$+++ Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
c12244 +++$+++ No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
c12244 +++$+++ Where'd they go?
c12244 +++$+++ The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
c12244 +++$+++ Are you a spirit too?
c12244 +++$+++ Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
c12244 +++$+++ I want to get in.
c12244 +++$+++ You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?
c12244 +++$+++ I think so.
c12244 +++$+++ Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
c12244 +++$+++ Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
c12244 +++$+++ That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
c12244 +++$+++ Yeah.
c12244 +++$+++ I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
c12244 +++$+++ I... I don't know what your name is.
c12244 +++$+++ Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
c12244 +++$+++ Of course you do.
c18884 +++$+++ The keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the Erlanger claim.
c18884 +++$+++ I gave it to him yesterday.
c18884 +++$+++ You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
c18884 +++$+++ No, I left it in his office.
c18884 +++$+++ Did you see him?
c18884 +++$+++ I've never seen him.  I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
c18884 +++$+++ He's usually in the storage room sorting things out.  He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.
c18884 +++$+++ Who's to say he ever will?  He's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes -- In fact, I'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me.
c02471 +++$+++ Really?
c02471 +++$+++ Well, I didn't want to assume.
c02471 +++$+++ Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
c19023 +++$+++ Thel, you ever hear from Joanna?
c19023 +++$+++ Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
c19023 +++$+++ Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis.  She wanted to know all about Billy.
c16255 +++$+++ ... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?
c16255 +++$+++ I don't know. Few munce.
c16255 +++$+++ ...What're you talking about?
c04796 +++$+++ I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
c04796 +++$+++ Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
c04796 +++$+++ You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car--and I won't use my thumb.
c01645 +++$+++ Okay, I'm going ahead. Wait a minute, what's her name?
c01645 +++$+++ Oh brother. Dorothy Vallens, Seventh Floor. Look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
c01645 +++$+++ Alright. Good luck, yourself.
c08478 +++$+++ The Parkers seem like nice folks.
c08478 +++$+++ They've been kind to me.
c08478 +++$+++ I guess I put a good scare into him.
c25648 +++$+++ I'm leaving.
c25648 +++$+++ When?.....How?
c25648 +++$+++ But you can't...you.
c08021 +++$+++ Gotta be ten degrees out there.
c08021 +++$+++ Radio said negative five.
c08021 +++$+++ Negative five?
c08021 +++$+++ Yeah.
c08021 +++$+++ Radio said.
c03409 +++$+++ I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
c03409 +++$+++ Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
c03409 +++$+++ They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
c03409 +++$+++ That's what I'm going to do.  That's what I'm going to do...
c24720 +++$+++ Stop this, please, stop this now!
c24720 +++$+++ No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
c24720 +++$+++ But you see what I'm getting at? You get a gorgeous house, you're highly paid. What are you gonna do, stay or leave? One voice comes back at me: stay!
c12452 +++$+++ Howdy do, Dude.
c12452 +++$+++ Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
c12452 +++$+++ Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, ups and downs.
c02921 +++$+++ All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning.  A name?
c02921 +++$+++ It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here.
c02921 +++$+++ Oh, really.
c02921 +++$+++ It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
c02921 +++$+++ Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
c02921 +++$+++ I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
c02921 +++$+++ Did you just have a brain-fart?
c02921 +++$+++ Pardon?
c02921 +++$+++ I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
c21294 +++$+++ Have they got Midge up there?
c21294 +++$+++ What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
c21294 +++$+++ A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
c18490 +++$+++ Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
c18490 +++$+++ What are you, a mind reader or something?
c18490 +++$+++ Oh, no.
c18490 +++$+++ Well, who are you, then?
c18490 +++$+++ Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
c18490 +++$+++ Angel, Second Class.
c07088 +++$+++ Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
c07088 +++$+++ Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
c07088 +++$+++ I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
c19437 +++$+++ So...what did you think of the tape.
c19437 +++$+++ I think you gave me the wrong one.
c19437 +++$+++ It was blank.  Nothing on it.  You gave me the wrong one.
c04873 +++$+++ They killed him, honey.
c04873 +++$+++ Huh?
c04873 +++$+++ Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
c06911 +++$+++ And the Lord told that man --
c06911 +++$+++ Yes! Yes!
c06911 +++$+++ The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
c06911 +++$+++ Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
c06911 +++$+++ IN THE RIIV-ER!
c01049 +++$+++ Let go of me!
c01049 +++$+++ Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
c01049 +++$+++ The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
c01049 +++$+++ I don't want that. I want to be with you.
c01049 +++$+++ I am committed. I love you.
c02610 +++$+++ You're really cramping my style here.
c02610 +++$+++ You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
c02610 +++$+++ That's the temperature of the sun.
c17445 +++$+++ Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
c17445 +++$+++ Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
c17445 +++$+++ I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
c15589 +++$+++ Remember when Senator Hamersley died in an accident up near Shenandoah?
c15589 +++$+++ Yeah.
c15589 +++$+++ The NSA killed him.
c15589 +++$+++ Jesus. Do you have proof?
c15589 +++$+++ Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
c15589 +++$+++ What's going on?
c15589 +++$+++ They're here.
c15589 +++$+++ Who?
c15589 +++$+++ Them.
c15589 +++$+++ Where?
c15589 +++$+++ Here?
c15589 +++$+++ <u>Here</u>?!
c15589 +++$+++ 'Kay, well, could you walk faster, please.
c05108 +++$+++ The hockey player? He a friend of yours?
c05108 +++$+++ Hockey player? He's not a ...
c05108 +++$+++ Old Earth?
c07802 +++$+++ I did my best but, well, you know me
c07802 +++$+++ Sure
c07802 +++$+++ Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
c07802 +++$+++ Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
c07802 +++$+++ Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
c07802 +++$+++ You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
c07802 +++$+++ Uh-huh
c07802 +++$+++ The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
c07802 +++$+++ But I am That's the killer, honey.
c15134 +++$+++ Eleven years ago.  Oh, it was dark... he was big for his age...damn ray gun he had looked real enough...yeah, I had all the right excuses...but afterwards... I really couldn't draw my gun again.
c15134 +++$+++ I...I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to make a joke of it.
c15134 +++$+++ Hey, you couldn't know.
c15134 +++$+++ Then this won't matter.  LAPD's not calling the shots anymore.
c15639 +++$+++ Can I talk to you a second?
c15639 +++$+++ Table 122?
c15639 +++$+++ I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
c22392 +++$+++ No, no, that would be crazy --
c22392 +++$+++ You thought the "Customs Agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "Ricky Tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. That's why you didn't tell me what we were doing...
c22392 +++$+++ I thought you'd think it was crazy.
c22392 +++$+++ I know.  I know.  I am sorry.
c04943 +++$+++ No shit. You know how he makes his money?
c04943 +++$+++ He sells guns.
c04943 +++$+++ You ever see him sell guns?
c04943 +++$+++ No.
c04943 +++$+++ Then how do you know he sells guns?
c04943 +++$+++ He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
c04943 +++$+++ Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
c08984 +++$+++ Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
c08984 +++$+++ Permission to speak candidly, sir?
c08984 +++$+++ Very well.
c08984 +++$+++ I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
c08984 +++$+++ And why not?
c08984 +++$+++ Because... there was no way to win.
c08984 +++$+++ A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
c08984 +++$+++ ... No, sir. It has not.
c08984 +++$+++ How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
c08984 +++$+++ Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
c26108 +++$+++ Dumont!
c26108 +++$+++ No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
c26108 +++$+++ They may be... de-rezzed... on the carrier ... hurry...
c16976 +++$+++ Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
c16976 +++$+++ Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
c16976 +++$+++ No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
c13884 +++$+++ You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
c13884 +++$+++ You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
c13884 +++$+++ Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
c13884 +++$+++ Thanks. You know something, Jake?
c13884 +++$+++ I think I'll kill her.
c26004 +++$+++ Wasn't that General Salazar?
c26004 +++$+++ Yeah.
c26004 +++$+++ I don't know.  Something.
c22048 +++$+++ She didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to Winston-Salem. It didn't last That girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. Little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?  A kike. That's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named Schapiro out in Seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name I got. Wouldn't you know it, Rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? She was always out of her friggin' head and I'll tell you why.  Buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. She was a nymphomaniac.
c22048 +++$+++ Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
c22048 +++$+++ I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
c22048 +++$+++ Dave Schapiro is no horse doctor and Rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. To call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing I ever heard in my life.
c22048 +++$+++ You loved her, didn't you. Well, so did I.  You'll have to admit she had four husbands.
c22048 +++$+++ Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
c22048 +++$+++ Yeah, I remember it.
c08234 +++$+++ A man would look anywhere for her, Mary. There is something exciting and unforgettable about her --- something you never get hold of --- something that keeps a man following after her.
c08234 +++$+++ Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things ----frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging --- waiting ---- I feel as if I'd never known her.
c08234 +++$+++ At least I can explain that, Mary. Your sister had a feeling about life ---- that it wasn't worth living unless one could end it. I helped her get that room.
c08234 +++$+++ Weren't you afraid?
c08234 +++$+++ I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
c08124 +++$+++ What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
c08124 +++$+++ You can stay here if you like.
c08124 +++$+++ I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
c19806 +++$+++ This line is tapped so I must be brief.
c19806 +++$+++ The agents --
c19806 +++$+++ They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
c19806 +++$+++ You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
c07890 +++$+++ I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
c07890 +++$+++ Why don't you just call him?
c07890 +++$+++ I dunno.
c07890 +++$+++ Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.
c17433 +++$+++ You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
c17433 +++$+++ Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
c17433 +++$+++ You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
c17433 +++$+++ Now don't get sassy, Ma.
c17433 +++$+++ I never *seen* her so sassy.  An' she ain't so young, neither!
c12086 +++$+++ You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
c12086 +++$+++ Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
c12086 +++$+++ I don't.  So, no.
c12086 +++$+++ Okay, you have a point.  Plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
c00008 +++$+++ Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
c00008 +++$+++ It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
c00008 +++$+++ Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
c00008 +++$+++ I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
c25023 +++$+++ I was right about Dallas. Wasn't I, Agent Mulder?
c25023 +++$+++ How?
c25023 +++$+++ I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
c25023 +++$+++ You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
c25023 +++$+++ According to the newspaper, FEMA had been called out to manage an outbreak of the Hanta virus. Are you familiar with the Hanta virus, Agent Mulder?
c25023 +++$+++ It was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the Southwest U.S. several years ago.
c25023 +++$+++ Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
c25318 +++$+++ Who else knows about the boy?
c25318 +++$+++ My sister... She lives in the next valley.
c25318 +++$+++ Yes...You-you're not going to take Shiva away?
c12910 +++$+++ It's alright, baby.
c12910 +++$+++ Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
c12910 +++$+++ If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
c12910 +++$+++ Your father.  He was your father.
c03122 +++$+++ It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
c03122 +++$+++ I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
c03122 +++$+++ How? By taking my money?
c03122 +++$+++ You can keep what you won today. That's yours.
c03122 +++$+++ Sit down, Leo.
c19343 +++$+++ He's a secretive man.
c19343 +++$+++ And you don't ask questions?
c19343 +++$+++ We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
c19343 +++$+++ Does that mean...?
c19343 +++$+++ We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
c19343 +++$+++ We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
c14206 +++$+++ But Bowery's fine, if that's what you want.
c14206 +++$+++ We taking bets?  What if you're wrong?
c14206 +++$+++ You got a deal.
c01788 +++$+++ Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.
c01788 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c01788 +++$+++ Go to the airport. Get a plane. I'll have a brass band waiting for you.
c01788 +++$+++ What?
c13801 +++$+++ Are you O.K.?
c13801 +++$+++ I'm fine.
c13801 +++$+++ I heard you got attacked.
c13801 +++$+++ I did.
c13801 +++$+++ I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
c13801 +++$+++ Yeah. I think it's really sick.
c13801 +++$+++ Why?
c13801 +++$+++ Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
c13801 +++$+++ Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
c13801 +++$+++ Did Sharon say no?
c13801 +++$+++ You know I want to go with you.
c13801 +++$+++ I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
c13801 +++$+++ No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
c09324 +++$+++ You work with Koessler?
c09324 +++$+++ Not especially.
c09324 +++$+++ Beats me. He just asked me to come along, double-check the forensics.  What did you do to piss him off?
c09126 +++$+++ I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
c09126 +++$+++ You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
c09126 +++$+++ Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
c07810 +++$+++ Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
c07810 +++$+++ Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
c07810 +++$+++ Marion--
c07810 +++$+++ Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
c07810 +++$+++ I am not that woman.
c27076 +++$+++ Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
c27076 +++$+++ Just say it, Dad.
c27076 +++$+++ I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
c27076 +++$+++ Well, good. Every little bit helps.
c08695 +++$+++ ...I forgive you Darwin.
c08695 +++$+++ Shoot, I appreciate that man.
c08695 +++$+++ If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
c08695 +++$+++ You woulda?
c08695 +++$+++ Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
c08695 +++$+++ I don't mind now anyway. You know, up here in Heaven, it's beautiful. Way better than fuckin' Hawaii or any place like that.
c03165 +++$+++ You okay?
c03165 +++$+++ Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
c03165 +++$+++ Nothing. Let's get outa here.
c17254 +++$+++ D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
c17254 +++$+++ I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
c17254 +++$+++ NO! No, I can't! I'm a busy man.
c01867 +++$+++ You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
c01867 +++$+++ Straight up.
c01867 +++$+++ Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
c01867 +++$+++ I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
c16784 +++$+++ You call what you did bad?!  You knocked her up and then left her!
c16784 +++$+++ No -- she left me!  After her miscarriage, I --
c16784 +++$+++ She did!
c10166 +++$+++ Ray. X22.
c10166 +++$+++ I read, Cooch.
c10166 +++$+++ Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy's house? Somebody took it down.
c10166 +++$+++ They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.
c05114 +++$+++ Colorful, isn't he?
c05114 +++$+++ You going to be all right?
c05114 +++$+++ I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
c17410 +++$+++ Open up! We hear you got a riot.
c17410 +++$+++ Riot? I don't see no riot. Who're you?
c17410 +++$+++ Deputy sheriffs.
c17410 +++$+++ Got a warrant?
c17410 +++$+++ Well, I don't know what you gonna do about it, because I don't hear no riot an' I don't see no riot, an' what's more I don't believe they *is* no riot.  Look for yourself.
c08612 +++$+++ You have a strong unfufilled desire.
c08612 +++$+++ Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
c08612 +++$+++ The band.
c07447 +++$+++ An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
c07447 +++$+++ Please.
c07447 +++$+++ Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
c09325 +++$+++ This is a sexy case.
c09325 +++$+++ Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
c09325 +++$+++ Doesn't fit.
c09325 +++$+++ This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
c09325 +++$+++ And who kills in the manner of his victim.
c09325 +++$+++ A very sexy case.
c27095 +++$+++ Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
c27095 +++$+++ I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
c27095 +++$+++ See? You're impertinent, rude, sarcastic.
c27095 +++$+++ A little respect would be nice, that's all.
c27188 +++$+++ Well?
c27188 +++$+++ They're coming.
c27188 +++$+++ When are they coming?
c27188 +++$+++ In an hour they're gone!
c00977 +++$+++ Actually, the boy's quite astute. I am trying to kill him. My Evil Associates have cautioned against it, so here he is, unfortunately, alive.
c00977 +++$+++ We've heard from Scott, now let's hear from you.
c00977 +++$+++ That's not true, Doctor. Please, tell us about your childhood.
c25276 +++$+++ Your brother stumbled upon Adonis's little secret, didn't he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more.  Leon didn't come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kid's life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldn't be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? "Leon does his own prints. Wouldn't want anyone to interfere with his 'Art'".  I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps it's the way you say them...
c25276 +++$+++ If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don't you accuse me of killing my brother?
c25276 +++$+++ Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You'd have been ready for me when I turned up with 'Sleeping Beauty'. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. "Not Leon," you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn't say 'My God!', or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. "Not Leon." Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I'd stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at PS15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn't you?
c25276 +++$+++ Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. He'd never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed too.
c14492 +++$+++ What else would you do?
c14492 +++$+++ I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
c14492 +++$+++ And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
c14492 +++$+++ How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
c14492 +++$+++ I have a terrible confession.
c14492 +++$+++ I don't like lamb.
c22768 +++$+++ One of these days the Russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  I'd like the chance to defend myself.  I'd like my wife to have that chance.  My civilian engineers. My secretary.
c22768 +++$+++ We're losing the war, aren't we.
c22768 +++$+++ It kind of looks that way.
c22768 +++$+++ Pistols, rifles, carbines ...  I'd be grateful.
c13331 +++$+++ You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
c13331 +++$+++ I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
c13331 +++$+++ You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
c13331 +++$+++ Yep.
c03050 +++$+++ No, please; an advance on your salary.
c03050 +++$+++ Mon General, I have come here to learn and to give, not to take.  I am serving without salary.
c03050 +++$+++ You must be very rich.
c03050 +++$+++ I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
c03050 +++$+++ 'Charming little victories?' Please don't expect much more of us, Monsieur.
c03050 +++$+++ I only meant...
c03050 +++$+++ These supplies...?
c03050 +++$+++ Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
c03050 +++$+++ Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
c17356 +++$+++ Sean, this is important. And it's above personal rivalry--
c17356 +++$+++ Now wait a minute, Gerry--
c17356 +++$+++ --No, no you hear me out, Sean. This young man is a true prodigy--
c17356 +++$+++ --Personal rivalry? I'm not getting back at you.
c17356 +++$+++ Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
c17356 +++$+++ That's a wonderful theory, Sean. It worked wonders for you.
c08860 +++$+++ 'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
c08860 +++$+++ I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
c08860 +++$+++ You can say that again!
c08860 +++$+++ I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
c09778 +++$+++ I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
c09778 +++$+++ I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
c09778 +++$+++ Violent action -- since that seems to be the only thing you people understand.  Leveling the island of Manhattan, perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of Gibraltar into the sea.
c00646 +++$+++ What anger?
c00646 +++$+++ About the ballet.
c00646 +++$+++ Ballet? What ballet?
c00646 +++$+++ Excuse me - didn't His Majesty specifically forbid ballet in his opera?
c00646 +++$+++ Yes, in the third act.
c16813 +++$+++ We're making too much of this.
c16813 +++$+++ No, we're not.
c16813 +++$+++ We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
c16885 +++$+++ What an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  So that's it.  Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
c16885 +++$+++ He was still warm when they confirmed.
c16885 +++$+++ This calls for a celebration.  Doesn't it?
c16885 +++$+++ So what?  You didn't kill him, did you?
c03936 +++$+++ He -- loves you.
c03936 +++$+++ I know.
c03936 +++$+++ Don't know. Really. I grew up with him.  I've missed him too, but now, every time I see him, I get confused. Hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. Even now, I feel he's here --
c10451 +++$+++ John: gimme a cuesta-ray.
c10451 +++$+++ Oh shit, what's today?
c10451 +++$+++ Today is Tuesday. What?
c10451 +++$+++ I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
c10451 +++$+++ Mickey: I'm supposed to meet somebody at O'Rourke's, I can't make it.
c11076 +++$+++ Birdie-
c11076 +++$+++ Hmm?
c11076 +++$+++ You don't like Eve, do you?
c11076 +++$+++ Do you want an argument or an answer?
c11076 +++$+++ An answer.
c11076 +++$+++ No.
c11076 +++$+++ Why not?
c11076 +++$+++ Now you want an argument.
c11076 +++$+++ She works hard.
c11076 +++$+++ Night an' day.
c11076 +++$+++ She's loyal and efficient-
c11076 +++$+++ Like an agent with one client.
c11076 +++$+++ She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
c11076 +++$+++ How do you mean that?
c22670 +++$+++ Over three-hundred.
c22670 +++$+++ I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
c22670 +++$+++ I don't expect to live that long.
c04113 +++$+++ My future husband died in battle against the Sutherlands.
c04113 +++$+++ What are you saying?  I'm standing here as real as you.
c04113 +++$+++ You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
c04113 +++$+++ But I did live.
c04113 +++$+++ Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
c04113 +++$+++ So why the crazy talk?  It's a miracle it is.  Saint Andrew has smiled on me.  On us.
c04113 +++$+++ Some think not.
c04113 +++$+++ Who?
c04113 +++$+++ There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
c04113 +++$+++ That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
c04113 +++$+++ I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
c04113 +++$+++ Me father has taken back my hand.
c16338 +++$+++ Why are you doing this?
c16338 +++$+++ It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
c16338 +++$+++ These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
c16338 +++$+++ Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.
c09103 +++$+++ Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
c09103 +++$+++ Intercept course, full impulse.  Weapons status?
c09103 +++$+++ Go to manual.
c00900 +++$+++ The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --
c00900 +++$+++ I remember.
c00900 +++$+++ After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
c00900 +++$+++ Guilt?
c00900 +++$+++ Poor baby. You know that's not true.
c15590 +++$+++ Gimme that.
c15590 +++$+++ You sure?
c15590 +++$+++ You're driving.
c15590 +++$+++ I didn't see a warrant. Did you see a warrant?
c14019 +++$+++ What do you mean by that?
c14019 +++$+++ Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
c14019 +++$+++ Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
c14019 +++$+++ - and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
c14019 +++$+++ I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
c14019 +++$+++ You've said a lot of things about the President in the last few months.
c14019 +++$+++ They're true!  Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
c14019 +++$+++ Charlie!
c14019 +++$+++ Look out that window.
c21503 +++$+++ Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
c21503 +++$+++ Company's not here, is it?
c21503 +++$+++ And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
c24182 +++$+++ Do you have any witnesses, Major?
c24182 +++$+++ What?
c24182 +++$+++ What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
c24182 +++$+++ Look, I didn't shoot him!
c24182 +++$+++ We'll have to leave that up to the C.I.D. boys, won't we, Major?
c24182 +++$+++ Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
c24182 +++$+++ Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
c24182 +++$+++ Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
c24182 +++$+++ Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
c24182 +++$+++ Look, General Ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd Bomb Wing to attack with H-bombs.
c24182 +++$+++ You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
c24182 +++$+++ Didn't they tell you?
c24182 +++$+++ Look, Colonel.  You keep me covered, but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to Air Command headquarters. Okay?...I won't play any tricks on you... Okay?
c08891 +++$+++ Well?
c08891 +++$+++ I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
c08891 +++$+++ I am uncertain. I have had little experience with emotions. I am unable to articulate the sensation.
c01080 +++$+++ People actually used to pay you for this?
c01080 +++$+++ Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
c01080 +++$+++ Sheep don't count.
c01080 +++$+++ That was never proved.
c22575 +++$+++ I thought you were never going to call me.
c22575 +++$+++ You did?
c22575 +++$+++ I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
c22575 +++$+++ You could have called me --
c22575 +++$+++ No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
c22575 +++$+++ You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
c22575 +++$+++ So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
c20760 +++$+++ How can you say that you 'admire' them?
c20760 +++$+++ It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
c20760 +++$+++ Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
c20760 +++$+++ They can't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the Knoxs. So, you may as well make the first move.
c20760 +++$+++ Unfortunately, yes.
c27228 +++$+++ How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
c27228 +++$+++ I have done nothing against the ordnung.
c27228 +++$+++ Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
c27228 +++$+++ I have committed no sin.
c27228 +++$+++ No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
c27228 +++$+++ Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
c10677 +++$+++ Humboldt County?
c10677 +++$+++ Maybe...
c10677 +++$+++ It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
c10677 +++$+++ Glaucoma?
c10677 +++$+++ Jesus, James. Wow.
c19372 +++$+++ So Nix won't come looking for her?
c19372 +++$+++ It's me betrayed him.
c19372 +++$+++ And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
c19372 +++$+++ Help me.
c03672 +++$+++ It's John, isn't it?
c03672 +++$+++ It's always John.
c03672 +++$+++ Still wants to move out?
c03672 +++$+++ He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
c03672 +++$+++ This kid just wants his freedom.
c03672 +++$+++ It's not going to happen.
c03672 +++$+++ The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
c03672 +++$+++ Doesn't make it bad advice.
c26204 +++$+++ Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
c26204 +++$+++ Have you read the story on Elvis?
c26204 +++$+++ No. Not yet.
c26204 +++$+++ That good, huh?
c22159 +++$+++ You can forget about sparring, kid.
c22159 +++$+++ Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
c22159 +++$+++ Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
c18722 +++$+++ Have you been here long?
c18722 +++$+++ No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
c18722 +++$+++ No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
c21455 +++$+++ We're going to draw blood.
c21455 +++$+++ Why are we going to do that?
c21455 +++$+++ You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
c14574 +++$+++ You're back!
c14574 +++$+++ How's the arm?  Still sore?
c14574 +++$+++ Much better.  You've been gone so long.
c14574 +++$+++ I'll go and make up his room!
c14678 +++$+++ I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
c14678 +++$+++ Be more specific.
c14678 +++$+++ In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
c14678 +++$+++ Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
c07387 +++$+++ Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
c07387 +++$+++ What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
c07387 +++$+++ But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
c05734 +++$+++ This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
c05734 +++$+++ Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
c05734 +++$+++ Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
c05734 +++$+++ Well, let's rock and roll.
c10455 +++$+++ Are you with me... are you awake...?
c10455 +++$+++ Yeah. I'm awake.
c10455 +++$+++ Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
c10455 +++$+++ The Doctors.
c10455 +++$+++ Read me what she said.
c12696 +++$+++ That's over fifty-thousand dollars profit per kilo.
c12696 +++$+++ And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
c12696 +++$+++ Oh my G-d.
c12696 +++$+++ Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
c12696 +++$+++ Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.
c12696 +++$+++ Now do you see what I am saying?
c12696 +++$+++ Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
c12516 +++$+++ I see from your questionnaire that you don't have any immediate next of kin?
c12516 +++$+++ Not that I'm in contact with.
c12516 +++$+++ Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
c12516 +++$+++ It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
c27404 +++$+++ Darling!
c27404 +++$+++ Hello...?
c27404 +++$+++ Surprised?
c27404 +++$+++ Well... yes.
c27404 +++$+++ I...
c24347 +++$+++ O.K.  Where's the cash?
c24347 +++$+++ Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
c24347 +++$+++ I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
c18487 +++$+++ Get that ladder up here.
c18487 +++$+++ All right -- all right.
c18487 +++$+++ I'm hurrying.
c17727 +++$+++ Oh, Hannah!
c17727 +++$+++ It's, uh, you never know--
c17727 +++$+++ He's such a loser!
c17727 +++$+++ He's not a loser at all!
c17727 +++$+++ Oh, he's such a loser!
c17727 +++$+++ Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
c26648 +++$+++ My love... because I love you.
c26648 +++$+++ I love you too... too late... too late...
c26648 +++$+++ Too late... there's something I must do...
c00230 +++$+++ How ya doin'?
c00230 +++$+++ Can't complain.
c00230 +++$+++ We got a lot to talk about.
c00230 +++$+++ Yeah, old times.
c00230 +++$+++ Sure, right.
c14438 +++$+++ Don't swear at me because we got problems.  I'm just giving you the news.  I went to a Catholic school; I'll tell you what they teach.  On the knuckles they teach.
c14438 +++$+++ Who've I got to beat up except the messenger?  Does this give us anything to go on?
c14438 +++$+++ I'm checking out anybody who lives like DeSalvo.  Records of arrests for rape, especially by a man wearing green.  Checking out psychiatric hospitals for his personality profile.  Cross check- ing names from arrests for sexual offenses, public fondling.  If they've got a German wife.  We can keep cops working on this kind of junk for years, and this guy's going to hit again, soon.
c14438 +++$+++ I know.  Get out here.
c14438 +++$+++ Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
c02823 +++$+++ I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
c02823 +++$+++ Better that way... for me.
c02823 +++$+++ Why?
c02823 +++$+++ I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
c02823 +++$+++ Worse.
c23561 +++$+++ His yacht?
c23561 +++$+++ It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
c23561 +++$+++ Or was it Bryn Mawr?
c02723 +++$+++ Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
c02723 +++$+++ But --
c02723 +++$+++ Okay then.
c07812 +++$+++ That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
c07812 +++$+++ It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
c07812 +++$+++ I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
c07812 +++$+++ You needn't use that language with me
c07812 +++$+++ Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
c07812 +++$+++ I wanted it
c07812 +++$+++ There's a different between want and
c07812 +++$+++ But why? Just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!
c13932 +++$+++ She's too upset.
c13932 +++$+++ What about?
c13932 +++$+++ Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
c13932 +++$+++ You mean she just found out?
c13932 +++$+++ Yes.
c13932 +++$+++ That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
c13932 +++$+++ What does it look like?
c13932 +++$+++ You're insane.
c06027 +++$+++ Heard of them.
c06027 +++$+++ They ran shit back in the Eighties. Used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. That's back when the Irish was making a play against the Italians. I don't know if they still around, but I don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
c06027 +++$+++ And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
c27231 +++$+++ I don't want to stay here.
c27231 +++$+++ They are English. They don't understand.
c27231 +++$+++ I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
c23592 +++$+++ Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
c23592 +++$+++ Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
c23592 +++$+++ Shells?  Whatever for?
c02510 +++$+++ Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
c02510 +++$+++ Hi.
c02510 +++$+++ How's it going?
c02510 +++$+++ Good. I called you at work today. They said you were home sick.
c02510 +++$+++ I know. I had to take the day to think.
c02510 +++$+++ Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
c02510 +++$+++ Long day thinking.
c05543 +++$+++ Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
c05543 +++$+++ You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
c05543 +++$+++ There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
c05543 +++$+++ You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise.  Dragons be deaf as tree stumps.
c24070 +++$+++ You forgot to wash my purple shirt.  I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
c24070 +++$+++ I didn't forget.  I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else.  Orange Red.  That's your color.  Few can carry it off.  Now please.  Help me find your brother.
c24070 +++$+++ Of course not.  Does he look lost to you?  BENNNNN!!!
c09961 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c09961 +++$+++ You have no idea what's going on.
c09961 +++$+++ Listen to me! You don't! The Jacket is my only chance in this place.
c06537 +++$+++ Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
c06537 +++$+++ Aw--
c06537 +++$+++ Ma! Hold him!
c16045 +++$+++ How're your hands?
c16045 +++$+++ Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
c16045 +++$+++ You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
c16045 +++$+++ Yeah, I know.  Me, too.
c16045 +++$+++ I can keep the beat.
c12008 +++$+++ I'm not afraid of her.
c12008 +++$+++ Why the hell not?
c12008 +++$+++ That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
c11617 +++$+++ You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
c11617 +++$+++ Fuck no.
c11617 +++$+++ We'll exterminate the fuckers !
c19975 +++$+++ That was wonderful.
c19975 +++$+++ Yeah, it's good to get together.
c19975 +++$+++ Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
c19975 +++$+++ Raise away.
c19975 +++$+++ Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
c09413 +++$+++ What are you doing?
c09413 +++$+++ What?
c09413 +++$+++ She didn't notice.
c17795 +++$+++ ...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
c17795 +++$+++ Is it necessary to know?
c17795 +++$+++ Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
c23671 +++$+++ Good mornin', Nathan.
c23671 +++$+++ Mornin'...
c23671 +++$+++ I'll wait till after the children.
c20695 +++$+++ National television?
c20695 +++$+++ ABC.
c20695 +++$+++ Minimum.
c24492 +++$+++ You don't have anything to be sorry 	about.  How could I . . .
c24492 +++$+++ Maybe you wanted to.
c24492 +++$+++ Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
c06193 +++$+++ Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
c06193 +++$+++ I'm fine.
c06193 +++$+++ Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
c06193 +++$+++ It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?
c04712 +++$+++ She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
c04712 +++$+++ She did a Harriman.
c04712 +++$+++ In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
c21095 +++$+++ It's an amazing place, don't you think?
c21095 +++$+++ Amazing.
c21095 +++$+++ Non.  Please.
c11205 +++$+++ Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
c11205 +++$+++ What?
c11205 +++$+++ I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
c11205 +++$+++ You mean...and orgasm?
c11205 +++$+++ You got it, stud.
c11205 +++$+++ Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
c11205 +++$+++ No you haven't.
c11205 +++$+++ But that one time --
c11205 +++$+++ No.
c11205 +++$+++ Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
c11205 +++$+++ Do you?
c11205 +++$+++ Do you love her?
c25616 +++$+++ Australia.
c25616 +++$+++ What?
c25616 +++$+++ I'd go to Australia.  Lot of land, not many people.  I think after this I'd like to quit people for awhile.  And the girls go crazy for brothers down there.
c25616 +++$+++ That's what I hear.  Don't matter.  Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold.
c04754 +++$+++ What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
c04754 +++$+++ Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
c04754 +++$+++ Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roads--all transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
c07092 +++$+++ Mein Kampf?
c07092 +++$+++ "A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
c07092 +++$+++ Remember -- listen up!  Fire team discipline is there at all times. Keep your radios on at all times during the entire penetration.  Check yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets, no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero three-hundred.
c07664 +++$+++ You got the admissions letter.
c07664 +++$+++ Right here.
c07664 +++$+++ I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
c26567 +++$+++ Continental Casualty...
c26567 +++$+++ Mr. Alito, please.
c26567 +++$+++ Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
c26567 +++$+++ I have to reach him.  This is an emergency.  Could you give me his home number?
c26567 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
c26567 +++$+++ ...Would you, would you call him up.  I'll give you my number, and ask him...
c26567 +++$+++ I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.
c16664 +++$+++ I just gave up smoking.  A last drink?
c16664 +++$+++ I'm running a little late.  You see, I'm having a party at <u>THE</u> Club to introduce the new lead singer for Black Vomit.  Everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, Don Cleveland.
c16664 +++$+++ Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
c15236 +++$+++ Pop, I don't believe this shit.  We runnin' welfare or somethin'? Every day you give dat bum--
c15236 +++$+++ Da Mayor ain't no bum.
c15236 +++$+++ Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
c04697 +++$+++ I want to be your -- your wife.
c04697 +++$+++ Huh?
c04697 +++$+++ No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
c04697 +++$+++ Did you just propose to me?
c04697 +++$+++ Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
c04697 +++$+++ Yes.
c04697 +++$+++ Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
c04697 +++$+++ Yes, Miles. I accept.
c04697 +++$+++ You do?
c04697 +++$+++ Do you want me to sleep on it?
c04697 +++$+++ No.
c04697 +++$+++ Do you want to sleep on it?
c04697 +++$+++ Yes. Again.
c25940 +++$+++ Mom, have you seen Woody?
c25940 +++$+++ Where was the last place you left him?
c25940 +++$+++ Right here in the van.
c25940 +++$+++ He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.
c16224 +++$+++ It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
c16224 +++$+++ Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
c16224 +++$+++ Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
c23218 +++$+++ Hi, Leonard.
c23218 +++$+++ Jackie, what're you doing?
c23218 +++$+++ I have to meet a client... who're you dating?
c25048 +++$+++ I'm quite prepared to tell you everything, though there isn't much you haven't guessed.
c25048 +++$+++ About the conspiracy?
c25048 +++$+++ I want to know where Scully is.
c02388 +++$+++ Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.
c02388 +++$+++ Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
c02388 +++$+++ Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
c02388 +++$+++ Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
c02388 +++$+++ ...Yes, Sir.
c12283 +++$+++ Can you see well?
c12283 +++$+++ Yes, very well, thank you.
c12283 +++$+++ Do you like it?
c12283 +++$+++ Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
c12283 +++$+++ ... Are you sure you like it?
c12283 +++$+++ Really? Really!!!
c21161 +++$+++ River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
c21161 +++$+++ I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
c21161 +++$+++ Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
c21161 +++$+++ The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
c21161 +++$+++ That's right... .
c21161 +++$+++ Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
c21161 +++$+++ Mm--hmm.
c21161 +++$+++ You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
c21161 +++$+++ Mm--hmmm.
c21161 +++$+++ They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
c21161 +++$+++ A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
c21161 +++$+++ Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
c21161 +++$+++ Maybe.
c09169 +++$+++ It's not quite the face you remember.
c09169 +++$+++ Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
c09169 +++$+++ A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
c09169 +++$+++ Yes. The eyes have it.
c09169 +++$+++ Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
c09169 +++$+++ They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was...  I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew.
c11289 +++$+++ Hi. Hi, hi.
c11289 +++$+++ Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
c11289 +++$+++ Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
c11289 +++$+++ Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta-  whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away... I have to say well. Oh, oh... God, Annie.  Well... oh, well... la-de-da, la-de- da, la-la.
c19273 +++$+++ So where does that put us?
c19273 +++$+++ Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
c19273 +++$+++ Seriously.
c19273 +++$+++ Seriously, I think we should get married.
c19273 +++$+++ We been through this before--
c19273 +++$+++ We should just do it.
c19273 +++$+++ And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
c19273 +++$+++ You could take it--
c19273 +++$+++ It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
c19273 +++$+++ Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal.
c07177 +++$+++ Well... I need to close now --
c07177 +++$+++ You live in that house behind the store?
c07177 +++$+++ You've lived here all your life?
c04766 +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
c04766 +++$+++ Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
c04766 +++$+++ You win!
c04197 +++$+++ Same way you did.  Through that gate.
c04197 +++$+++ I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
c04197 +++$+++ All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
c04197 +++$+++ Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
c04197 +++$+++ Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
c03951 +++$+++ Well?
c03951 +++$+++ I don't want to see the dress.
c03951 +++$+++ I don't want to see the dress.
c16725 +++$+++ Got it.
c16725 +++$+++ Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
c16725 +++$+++ How?
c16725 +++$+++ All right, I'm with you.  I just hope we know what the hell we're doing.
c14516 +++$+++ Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
c14516 +++$+++ I love him.
c14516 +++$+++ You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
c14516 +++$+++ No way. You keep the ring.     You'll come to your senses.
c27422 +++$+++ Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
c27422 +++$+++ I'm sure we will.
c27422 +++$+++ How do you do?
c18773 +++$+++ I don't want to be friends anymore.
c18773 +++$+++ Fine.
c18773 +++$+++ Beautiful.
c18773 +++$+++ Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
c20236 +++$+++ What are we downloading?
c20236 +++$+++ Information.
c20236 +++$+++ Profitable.
c03393 +++$+++ Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
c03393 +++$+++ Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
c03393 +++$+++ Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
c03393 +++$+++ I'm serious.
c03393 +++$+++ So am I.
c03393 +++$+++ We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
c03393 +++$+++ Give away food?
c03393 +++$+++ Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
c03393 +++$+++ Make a gift to the people.  It's your money anyway so it's only fair.
c22229 +++$+++ Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
c22229 +++$+++ Yeah?
c22229 +++$+++ Good idea.
c21674 +++$+++ What period?
c21674 +++$+++ Suez.  1956.
c21674 +++$+++ Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
c21674 +++$+++ All right.
c21674 +++$+++ It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
c21674 +++$+++ They don't count.
c05489 +++$+++ Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
c05489 +++$+++ I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
c05489 +++$+++ Yes.
c18990 +++$+++ Now then, Mr. O'Connor, how long did Ted Kramer work for you?
c18990 +++$+++ Eight, almost nine years.
c18990 +++$+++ And did you have a close personal relationship?
c18990 +++$+++ Yes...
c18990 +++$+++ And how did you find his work?
c18990 +++$+++ And yet you fired him.
c16501 +++$+++ Come on, DiPesto. We can still have a good time.
c16501 +++$+++ You're the pathetic one, not me.
c16501 +++$+++ I'm going on over there...
c16501 +++$+++ I'm not some piece a crap.
c16501 +++$+++ I know you're not.
c16501 +++$+++ You treat me like I was.
c16501 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c16501 +++$+++ Now, hand...
c17875 +++$+++ Come on! Sausage rolls.
c17875 +++$+++ Come on through.
c17875 +++$+++ and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
c17875 +++$+++ whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
c12174 +++$+++ God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
c12174 +++$+++ A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
c12174 +++$+++ Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
c12174 +++$+++ Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
c12174 +++$+++ Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
c12174 +++$+++ Oh, absolutely.  Bruce and I are very close.
c13332 +++$+++ This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
c13332 +++$+++ Naw...
c13332 +++$+++ "Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
c13332 +++$+++ By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
c13332 +++$+++ I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
c26135 +++$+++ Is this national security stuff boring you?
c26135 +++$+++ Put a tap on her phone.
c26135 +++$+++ Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
c19167 +++$+++ We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
c19167 +++$+++ I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
c19167 +++$+++ No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
c19167 +++$+++ "Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
c19167 +++$+++ Magua say: "Yes. Good idea."
c20038 +++$+++ You need to consider a few issues.
c20038 +++$+++ ...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
c20038 +++$+++ Sure.
c20038 +++$+++ Of course.  From my side, I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it...  So let me know if we're on...
c06926 +++$+++ Now! Where's it hid, honey?
c06926 +++$+++ I'll tell.
c06926 +++$+++ NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
c10499 +++$+++ John Saxon.  Do you have any idea what time it is?
c10499 +++$+++ John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
c10499 +++$+++ You got it.  What's happening?
c10499 +++$+++ Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
c10499 +++$+++ John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
c08268 +++$+++ That makes it all the more difficult ----
c08268 +++$+++ Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
c08268 +++$+++ We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
c08268 +++$+++ Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
c08268 +++$+++ Of course.
c11583 +++$+++ Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life.
c11583 +++$+++ I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
c11583 +++$+++ Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
c11583 +++$+++ I like all of them --
c11583 +++$+++ Good -- like I said, take your pick.
c11583 +++$+++ Now just a second -- I'm doing you a favor, buddy -- what're you trying to pull?
c05874 +++$+++ In that event, we better make arrangements to get some porters immediately. Some means to get us back to civilization.
c05874 +++$+++ Are you so certain you are away from it?
c05874 +++$+++ Oh, dear.
c17596 +++$+++ Can I come over after Jamie's asleep?
c17596 +++$+++ My parents are going to come home early tonight.
c17596 +++$+++ So?
c17596 +++$+++ Okay, I guess. I'll call you later.
c13293 +++$+++ Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
c13293 +++$+++ No --
c13293 +++$+++ But --
c21253 +++$+++ I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
c21253 +++$+++ That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
c21253 +++$+++ Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
c21253 +++$+++ Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
c04737 +++$+++ Oh--Mary--
c04737 +++$+++ Yes, sir?
c04737 +++$+++ How is she?
c04737 +++$+++ Why--uh--she's all right, sir.
c04737 +++$+++ What's the matter? Anything wrong?
c04737 +++$+++ Oh, no, sir. No different than--
c04737 +++$+++ Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sir--she sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
c26575 +++$+++ Is it over?
c26575 +++$+++ No.
c26575 +++$+++ I don't have a goddamned idea.
c24679 +++$+++ Not even of dying?
c24679 +++$+++ No.
c24679 +++$+++ No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
c00384 +++$+++ Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you still know.
c00384 +++$+++ I don't want to.
c00384 +++$+++ Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
c00384 +++$+++ It's not that.
c00384 +++$+++ What then?
c00384 +++$+++ It's stupid.
c00384 +++$+++ It's fun.
c00384 +++$+++ Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
c08639 +++$+++ Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
c08639 +++$+++ You took Bill.
c08639 +++$+++ And this is mine.
c10465 +++$+++ Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
c10465 +++$+++ I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
c10465 +++$+++ We had a chance...We could have stopped them!  The mob stole the trucks and smashed everything up.  The fools!  They cut their own throats!
c21982 +++$+++ I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
c21982 +++$+++ He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
c21982 +++$+++ I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
c21982 +++$+++ Buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, I don't want to talk to you. I'm going out and sweep the patio.
c01957 +++$+++ I have the letters right here.
c01957 +++$+++ Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
c01957 +++$+++ Serves me right for not being musical.
c25914 +++$+++ You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
c25914 +++$+++ I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
c25914 +++$+++ Not anymore, not in the city.
c25914 +++$+++ We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
c25914 +++$+++ Well, you just have to move further out.
c25914 +++$+++ I'm not here to argue, sir.
c26781 +++$+++ I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
c26781 +++$+++ What's wrong with Parker?
c26781 +++$+++ Show me his physical sensory level.
c18399 +++$+++ I'm sorry?
c18399 +++$+++ I said you're going to get a phone call.
c18399 +++$+++ Oh?
c18399 +++$+++ Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
c18399 +++$+++ You're going to be brought in for questioning.
c01139 +++$+++ OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
c01139 +++$+++ I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
c01139 +++$+++ Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
c01139 +++$+++ I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
c01139 +++$+++ There's just no way the Mets will lose this game. Gooden is pitching and Strawberry is ready to break out.
c23669 +++$+++ That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
c23669 +++$+++ I wanta get some things.
c23669 +++$+++ I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
c23669 +++$+++ I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
c23669 +++$+++ I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
c16108 +++$+++ Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
c16108 +++$+++ Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
c16108 +++$+++ They don't give two fucks about your health.  The Clinic's where they send the real hard-cases for attitude adjustment.  Look at O'Neill --
c14030 +++$+++ Yes, and maybe he didn't.
c14030 +++$+++ Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
c14030 +++$+++ All we saw on that screen was a big American -
c10954 +++$+++ Hello.
c10954 +++$+++ Hello.
c10954 +++$+++ Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
c10954 +++$+++ No, not me.
c10954 +++$+++ Oh you are, I know you are.
c10954 +++$+++ No, I'm not.
c10954 +++$+++ You are.
c10954 +++$+++ I'm not, no.
c10954 +++$+++ Well, you look like him.
c10954 +++$+++ Oh you do, look.
c17921 +++$+++ You got a drinking problem or what?
c17921 +++$+++ I sell them at the recycling center. Gives me a little for gas and food.
c17921 +++$+++ In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp out in the woods.  I thought maybe you were down on your luck too when I picked you up.
c00112 +++$+++ You goin' to the escort service?
c00112 +++$+++ You got any better ideas?
c00112 +++$+++ Mind if I ride along with you?
c00112 +++$+++ But what if it does?  You might need my help.
c15578 +++$+++ No one. But I'm a little nervous.
c15578 +++$+++ When can you get it here?
c15578 +++$+++ I'm doing a transfer now.
c15578 +++$+++ Come straight here. Don't talk to anyone.
c15578 +++$+++ Be careful, Danny.
c24918 +++$+++ Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
c24918 +++$+++ Oh, hell. Drink?
c24918 +++$+++ No thanks.
c24918 +++$+++ Sure you don't need one?
c24918 +++$+++ I'm fine.
c24918 +++$+++ OK. Boy. Jesus!
c24918 +++$+++ Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
c17025 +++$+++ A job with Graff.
c17025 +++$+++ Is that what I said?
c17025 +++$+++ He would take you on.  Yes.
c17831 +++$+++ That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
c17831 +++$+++ Oh thanks, it was nothing...
c17831 +++$+++ Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
c22703 +++$+++ I don't feel anything.
c22703 +++$+++ Come on, it's graduation.
c22703 +++$+++ Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
c22703 +++$+++ Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.
c09779 +++$+++ It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
c09779 +++$+++ I leave that in your hands.
c09779 +++$+++ You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
c09779 +++$+++ No -- not at all.
c09779 +++$+++ What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
c09779 +++$+++ My name is Carpenter and I'm a very earthy character living in a respectable boarding house.
c09779 +++$+++ I'm afraid I can't offer you any real protection. I have no influence in cases of inter-planetary conspiracy.
c09779 +++$+++ I'm sure I'll be quite safe until the meeting.
c09779 +++$+++ I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
c01800 +++$+++ It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
c01800 +++$+++ It's nothing. It's just a picture.
c01800 +++$+++ No, I do.
c08100 +++$+++ That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
c08100 +++$+++ Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
c08100 +++$+++ And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
c20060 +++$+++ Guy's involved in a "meet"...
c20060 +++$+++ "Buy and walk"?  "Buy and bust"? "Reverse undercover"?  What?
c20060 +++$+++ Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
c20060 +++$+++ And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
c20060 +++$+++ ...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
c12903 +++$+++ Left hand's the past.  Your right's the present.  And the future.  But it's not written in stone.  It's written in flesh and blood.  And flesh and blood will change.  See?  There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
c12903 +++$+++ Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
c12903 +++$+++ Don't you worry about a thing.  This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
c19789 +++$+++ Can I help you with something?
c19789 +++$+++ Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
c19789 +++$+++ Who is this? TONY CLIFTON  You -- you know damn straight who it is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to respect.  A name to fear.  Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.
c19789 +++$+++ Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!
c21257 +++$+++ Leave it where it is.
c21257 +++$+++ Wait.  You not Adele?
c21257 +++$+++ Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
c20653 +++$+++ Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
c20653 +++$+++ Hi Vada, can you come out?
c20653 +++$+++ Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
c18795 +++$+++ Did you read Malcolm's book?
c18795 +++$+++ Yeah.
c18795 +++$+++ I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
c16494 +++$+++ Tell me more. I want to know everything.
c16494 +++$+++ There isn't any more to tell.
c16494 +++$+++ Don't say that.
c16494 +++$+++ No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
c16494 +++$+++ Well, it's enough for me.
c16494 +++$+++ You don't have to say that.
c16494 +++$+++ I never say anything I have to.
c16494 +++$+++ I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
c16494 +++$+++ What are we about to do?
c16494 +++$+++ Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
c16494 +++$+++ I don't drink coffee...
c16494 +++$+++ ... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
c16494 +++$+++ And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
c18899 +++$+++ Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
c18899 +++$+++ First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
c18899 +++$+++ Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
c21415 +++$+++ In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
c21415 +++$+++ No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
c21415 +++$+++ You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
c21415 +++$+++ No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
c21415 +++$+++ Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
c05229 +++$+++ Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
c05229 +++$+++ Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
c05229 +++$+++ Oh man, that's the best.
c05229 +++$+++ Let me smell it again.
c14930 +++$+++ This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
c14930 +++$+++ I didn't know you taught.
c14930 +++$+++ English.  Way before your time.  It was hard giving it up, I'll tell you.  I'm hearing rumors, John, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I'm not saying they have anything to do with the Dalton boy's outburst, but I don't think I have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
c14930 +++$+++ Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
c14930 +++$+++ What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
c14930 +++$+++ Courtyard?
c14930 +++$+++ Boys marching.  Clapping in unison.
c14930 +++$+++ Oh that. That was an exercise to prove a point.  About the evils of conformity.
c14930 +++$+++ John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
c14930 +++$+++ At these boys' age? Not on your life! Tradition, John.  Discipline.  Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.
c15186 +++$+++ I've already formulated a plan.
c15186 +++$+++ What?
c15186 +++$+++ There's always a loophole with you, Claremont. Your black ass is one big loophole. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- [FLASH FORWARD] NIGHT
c26628 +++$+++ We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
c26628 +++$+++ No! Let me go!
c26628 +++$+++ We're going up the tower.
c26628 +++$+++ I'm going to. It's my second chance.
c25434 +++$+++ You the owner here?
c25434 +++$+++ That's right.
c25434 +++$+++ Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
c25434 +++$+++ Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
c25434 +++$+++ I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
c25434 +++$+++ Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
c25434 +++$+++ No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
c05982 +++$+++ Where?
c05982 +++$+++ Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
c05982 +++$+++ That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
c05982 +++$+++ If... you have one.
c05982 +++$+++ -- and then walk out.
c05982 +++$+++ You're insane or you think I am.
c23106 +++$+++ You must be Hugo.
c23106 +++$+++ You must be Juliet.
c23106 +++$+++ I'd be delighted.
c13783 +++$+++ Of what?
c13783 +++$+++ A bullet to the right cerebellum.
c13783 +++$+++ No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
c13997 +++$+++ I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
c13997 +++$+++ But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
c13997 +++$+++ There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
c13997 +++$+++ No, it can't.  Good night, darling.
c08950 +++$+++ Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
c08950 +++$+++ I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
c08950 +++$+++ Takes the stuff a while to ferment. Gimme.
c25659 +++$+++ We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
c25659 +++$+++ So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
c25659 +++$+++ Treat. We treat devices.
c25659 +++$+++ Don't push it, slick.
c14325 +++$+++ Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
c14325 +++$+++ What would you have me say, David?
c14325 +++$+++ Nothing.  I guess I just wanted to thank you.
c14325 +++$+++ For giving me a chance, just for a moment, to feel what it must be like to be you.
c17043 +++$+++ Excuse me, fella.
c17043 +++$+++ ...did they...
c17043 +++$+++ Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
c19495 +++$+++ Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
c19495 +++$+++ I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
c19495 +++$+++ I...can't.
c19495 +++$+++ Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
c01476 +++$+++ Don't make me laugh.  It makes me pee.
c01476 +++$+++ Sorry.
c01476 +++$+++ Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
c01476 +++$+++ I'm doing okay.
c01476 +++$+++ From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
c01476 +++$+++ Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
c01476 +++$+++ Money?
c01476 +++$+++ No.  I got a problem.
c01476 +++$+++ I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
c07654 +++$+++ No way.
c07654 +++$+++ One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
c07654 +++$+++ It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
c07654 +++$+++ What?
c07654 +++$+++ I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
c07654 +++$+++ I got lost.  Oh here ... look at this!
c09234 +++$+++ This has always been my favorite time of day.
c09234 +++$+++ Very beautiful country up here...
c09234 +++$+++ Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
c09234 +++$+++ Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
c09234 +++$+++ No.
c17950 +++$+++ What is it?
c17950 +++$+++ The...Silver...Mike...Award!
c17950 +++$+++ This guy LaPlante won an award?
c17950 +++$+++ LaPlante!
c05272 +++$+++ Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
c05272 +++$+++ Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
c05272 +++$+++ Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
c05272 +++$+++ I start thinking about what I'm gonna eat afterwards.
c15337 +++$+++ Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
c15337 +++$+++ It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
c15337 +++$+++ Formaldehyde.
c11877 +++$+++ Operator...
c11877 +++$+++ Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
c11877 +++$+++ Sir, it only costs a nickel.
c11877 +++$+++ Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
c09727 +++$+++ He's not home.
c09727 +++$+++ Where can I find him?
c09727 +++$+++ You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
c09727 +++$+++ But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
c09727 +++$+++ There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
c09727 +++$+++ And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
c16207 +++$+++ Your tissue, your organs, your entire biophysical structure is changing. Every system is still functioning, somehow --
c16207 +++$+++ And they're changing into...
c16207 +++$+++ I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
c16207 +++$+++ Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
c16207 +++$+++ At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
c16207 +++$+++ I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --
c10059 +++$+++ Here, just have one of these then.
c10059 +++$+++ Healy, what I just tell you?
c10059 +++$+++ No I can't.
c24652 +++$+++ I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
c24652 +++$+++ With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
c24652 +++$+++ I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
c24652 +++$+++ Can't hurt...
c24652 +++$+++ Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
c24652 +++$+++ I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
c24652 +++$+++ No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
c10043 +++$+++ That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
c10043 +++$+++ Hey, look on the bright side --
c10043 +++$+++ What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
c10043 +++$+++ I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world.
c10328 +++$+++ I followed you here from court.
c10328 +++$+++ I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
c10328 +++$+++ That's right.
c06659 +++$+++ You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
c06659 +++$+++ Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
c06659 +++$+++ Is she home?
c06659 +++$+++ Is Mary home?
c24955 +++$+++ What is it?
c24955 +++$+++ I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
c24955 +++$+++ You're right.
c10601 +++$+++ I really do think it's the best night of my life.
c10601 +++$+++ We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
c10601 +++$+++ Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
c10601 +++$+++ Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
c10601 +++$+++ You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
c10601 +++$+++ No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
c10601 +++$+++ It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
c25664 +++$+++ Not bad for Bomb squad, eh?
c25664 +++$+++ What not bad. You've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
c25664 +++$+++ Well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
c19907 +++$+++ Don' be facety, woman.
c19907 +++$+++ None facety, mistah.  You come for me?  Dat's good news.
c19907 +++$+++ No, I come to see Doctor.
c19907 +++$+++ Nuthin'.
c20286 +++$+++ I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?
c20286 +++$+++ Yeah.
c20286 +++$+++ I'm really afraid.
c20286 +++$+++ Why?
c20286 +++$+++ I'm afraid of who I am.
c20286 +++$+++ And you're not now?
c19265 +++$+++ Dad, I talked to the track coach--
c19265 +++$+++ I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
c19265 +++$+++ How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
c05424 +++$+++ Is he still alive?
c05424 +++$+++ Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
c05424 +++$+++ No... Dino's.
c08649 +++$+++ Just the man who's gonna see you driven to your knees! Sheriff Buell Clayton from Texas.
c08649 +++$+++ Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
c08649 +++$+++ You.
c08649 +++$+++ Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
c08649 +++$+++ Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
c18903 +++$+++ Kafka -- is that your real name?
c18903 +++$+++ Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
c18903 +++$+++ When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
c18903 +++$+++ Wednesday.  We left the office together.
c18903 +++$+++ Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
c18903 +++$+++ No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
c18903 +++$+++ Your office is the Workmen's --
c18903 +++$+++ -- Accident and Compensation Association.
c18903 +++$+++ Where you've been employed for seven years.
c18903 +++$+++ Eight -- and seven months.
c18903 +++$+++ Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
c18903 +++$+++ Well -- other departments are, yes.
c18903 +++$+++ Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
c18903 +++$+++ Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
c18903 +++$+++ He was found in the River.  Could he swim?
c18903 +++$+++ I don't know.
c18903 +++$+++ Was he depressed?
c18903 +++$+++ No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
c18903 +++$+++ Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
c18903 +++$+++ No, I suppose not.
c18903 +++$+++ He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
c18903 +++$+++ Can I ask -- how you found me?
c18903 +++$+++ His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
c18903 +++$+++ We know that.
c02885 +++$+++ Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm only gonna count to five. One...two... three... four...
c02885 +++$+++ Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!
c02885 +++$+++ Not good enough, swear to God.
c02885 +++$+++ Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One...
c15005 +++$+++ You should have put that on last night.
c15005 +++$+++ I know.
c15005 +++$+++ Yeah.
c27358 +++$+++ So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
c27358 +++$+++ No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
c27358 +++$+++ We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
c27358 +++$+++ There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
c27358 +++$+++ What's that?
c27358 +++$+++ I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year.
c27358 +++$+++ You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
c27358 +++$+++ I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger.
c23341 +++$+++ Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
c23341 +++$+++ Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
c23341 +++$+++ Where's who?
c23341 +++$+++ I wouldn't even tell the Pope.
c07536 +++$+++ You don't know?
c07536 +++$+++ It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
c07536 +++$+++ But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
c07536 +++$+++ Then you must have at some point tried to reverse the procedure.
c08039 +++$+++ How are we gonna do this, Nick?
c08039 +++$+++ You're the getaway girl. The money's gonna get to you eventually. Gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. But I can't do that without a gun. Any luck talking to him?
c08039 +++$+++ Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
c08039 +++$+++ Is there any way you could get into his truck?
c08039 +++$+++ We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
c13956 +++$+++ No problem with me on the Job.
c13956 +++$+++ Yeah.  Do you have any references?
c13956 +++$+++ City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
c13956 +++$+++ That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
c13956 +++$+++ Never heard of 'em... new owners?
c13956 +++$+++ Yeah.
c13956 +++$+++ Yeah, I'll do that.
c06372 +++$+++ The 6 horse is last.
c06372 +++$+++ That's okay. That's his style.
c06372 +++$+++ To run late!
c23586 +++$+++ Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
c23586 +++$+++ My fault.
c23586 +++$+++ You're not hurt, are you?
c23586 +++$+++ I don't think so.
c23586 +++$+++ I wish you'd make sure.
c23586 +++$+++ Why?
c23586 +++$+++ Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
c23586 +++$+++ Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
c23586 +++$+++ Thank you.
c23586 +++$+++ Now, really -
c05164 +++$+++ Why aren't you at work?
c05164 +++$+++ I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
c05164 +++$+++ No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
c05164 +++$+++ No, more commercial stuff.
c05164 +++$+++ Like what?
c05164 +++$+++ Commercials.
c05164 +++$+++ Oh.
c05164 +++$+++ Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
c05164 +++$+++ Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
c05164 +++$+++ I wrote that.
c05164 +++$+++ They'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home.
c21574 +++$+++ Want to dance?
c21574 +++$+++ Dance? Here?
c21574 +++$+++ Why not?
c21574 +++$+++ I know everybody. I don't look at half of life, just the nice half, I look at all of it.
c15604 +++$+++ Did he give you anything?
c15604 +++$+++ No.
c15604 +++$+++ Anything at all?
c15604 +++$+++ No, sir.
c15604 +++$+++ Was he with anyone?
c15604 +++$+++ Not that I could see.
c15604 +++$+++ Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
c15604 +++$+++ No.
c15604 +++$+++ Why'd you go to Harrison's?
c15604 +++$+++ To buy lingerie.
c15604 +++$+++ For your wife?
c15604 +++$+++ I thought maybe it might be for Rachel Banks.
c14379 +++$+++ What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
c14379 +++$+++ We got it locked in the sock.
c14379 +++$+++ Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
c14379 +++$+++ You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
c14379 +++$+++ 'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
c14379 +++$+++ Us elephants may be a lil slow, like in makin' love, but you give us a coupla three days to really get with it an' man -- stand back!
c18878 +++$+++ It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
c18878 +++$+++ What is it really?
c18878 +++$+++ Well, as long as I admire it from afar it shouldn't worry me if it's hollow.
c05903 +++$+++ You shot an eight year old girl.
c05903 +++$+++ Uh... yes.  Apparently I did, air.
c05903 +++$+++ The hell were you thinking?
c05903 +++$+++ Obvious?  Why don't you and I have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
c16317 +++$+++ Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
c16317 +++$+++ Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
c16317 +++$+++ Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
c16317 +++$+++ Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
c16317 +++$+++ Copy.
c16317 +++$+++ There's the car! There's the car!
c21882 +++$+++ We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
c21882 +++$+++ No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
c21882 +++$+++ Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
c21882 +++$+++ Look at the picture. Please.
c26946 +++$+++ Who are you?
c26946 +++$+++ It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
c26946 +++$+++ You're the flower lady.
c26946 +++$+++ Um...yes.
c26946 +++$+++ Is everything alright?
c17809 +++$+++ ...my love...
c17809 +++$+++ ...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
c17809 +++$+++ I am on the track of...
c17809 +++$+++ ...what do you expect me to...
c06642 +++$+++ And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
c06642 +++$+++ Oh, they insisted on following me.
c06642 +++$+++ What do you think bodyguards are for?
c06642 +++$+++ Are those stories true?
c25437 +++$+++ You wanted by the law or somethin'?
c25437 +++$+++ Naw, it's okay.
c25437 +++$+++ You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
c25437 +++$+++ Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'.
c25437 +++$+++ You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
c25437 +++$+++ I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
c25437 +++$+++ It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
c25437 +++$+++ I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
c25437 +++$+++ I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
c25437 +++$+++ He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
c25437 +++$+++ Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
c25437 +++$+++ What makes you think you can trust him?  He didn't do shit.
c24060 +++$+++ You hear that?
c24060 +++$+++ Yes, I hear it.
c24060 +++$+++ I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
c12644 +++$+++ Oh yeah?
c12644 +++$+++ You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
c12644 +++$+++ Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
c12644 +++$+++ Am I bothering you?
c12644 +++$+++ No. You're not bothering me. You a senior?
c12644 +++$+++ Yes.
c12644 +++$+++ How is Central these days?
c12644 +++$+++ Terrible. boring.
c12644 +++$+++ What else is new?. right?
c12644 +++$+++ Yeah. What are you doing now?
c12644 +++$+++ I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
c12644 +++$+++ That's too bad.
c12644 +++$+++ What do you know about the ear?. anything?
c12644 +++$+++ Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?
c12644 +++$+++ Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
c12644 +++$+++ I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
c12644 +++$+++ Do you know who was brought in for questioning?
c12644 +++$+++ There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
c12644 +++$+++ Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
c12644 +++$+++ No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
c12644 +++$+++ The ear is from a missing person maybe?
c12644 +++$+++ Maybe so.
c12644 +++$+++ It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
c12644 +++$+++ Yeah. It's close by. that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
c12644 +++$+++ Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
c02588 +++$+++ Maybe one of the original crew?
c02588 +++$+++ No. It was someone else.
c02588 +++$+++ Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
c18522 +++$+++ Now look, did you buy anything?
c18522 +++$+++ Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
c18522 +++$+++ This way.
c26002 +++$+++ My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children.  Are you aware of this?
c26002 +++$+++ I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
c26002 +++$+++ We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
c26002 +++$+++ Not in...
c26579 +++$+++ I have to talk to you.
c26579 +++$+++ What do you want?
c26579 +++$+++ Don't touch anything.
c25714 +++$+++ Madame.
c25714 +++$+++ Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
c25714 +++$+++ And so will M'sieu Giron.
c19393 +++$+++ Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
c19393 +++$+++ I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
c19393 +++$+++ Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
c19393 +++$+++ Ok, whatever you want.
c19393 +++$+++ Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
c19393 +++$+++ No, I was looking at you.
c19393 +++$+++ Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
c19393 +++$+++ I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
c19393 +++$+++ Oh, for her show?
c19393 +++$+++ No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
c19393 +++$+++ Oh.
c19393 +++$+++ I know.
c13823 +++$+++ A little early for a delivery.
c13823 +++$+++ Oh...
c13823 +++$+++ ...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
c13823 +++$+++ ...-ty.
c13823 +++$+++ Where's Sam?
c13823 +++$+++ Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
c13823 +++$+++ Where do you want this stuff?
c13823 +++$+++ Freezer in the back.
c13823 +++$+++ Art.
c09878 +++$+++ So, do we go on?
c09878 +++$+++ Yes.
c09878 +++$+++ Oh, shut up.
c02143 +++$+++ Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
c02143 +++$+++ We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
c02143 +++$+++ This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
c02143 +++$+++ Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
c02143 +++$+++ We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
c02143 +++$+++ First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again.  There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?
c14989 +++$+++ She's in back.
c14989 +++$+++ Thanks.
c14989 +++$+++ How was huntin'?
c14989 +++$+++ Oh. Fine.
c14989 +++$+++ Get anything?
c14989 +++$+++ Too bad.
c03820 +++$+++ I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way.
c03820 +++$+++ I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
c03820 +++$+++ They are the same.
c03820 +++$+++ Do you live in a house back in wherever.
c03820 +++$+++ On your own land?
c16683 +++$+++ A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here alone.
c16683 +++$+++ Where from?
c16683 +++$+++ Des Moines.
c16683 +++$+++ Businessman.  Owns a department store in Des Moines, I think.
c09056 +++$+++ You have no idea what precipitated his behavior?
c09056 +++$+++ ... And now he's holding our people hostage down there...
c09056 +++$+++ The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
c09056 +++$+++ That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
c09056 +++$+++ We haven't fully identified the anomalies yet. They're calling this whole area The Briar Patch... it took us a day to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me Data's schematics. I'll keep you informed.  Dougherty out.
c15842 +++$+++ Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
c15842 +++$+++ Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
c15842 +++$+++ Yes, Admiral .... soon.
c00381 +++$+++ Open the door, will ya?
c00381 +++$+++ Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
c00381 +++$+++ Open the door. We're late.
c00381 +++$+++ What do you mean I got money? I'm as broke as you.
c25845 +++$+++ See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
c25845 +++$+++ You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
c25845 +++$+++ Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
c25845 +++$+++ The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
c25845 +++$+++ Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
c25686 +++$+++ He's really not a bad fellow.
c25686 +++$+++ Just dull.
c25686 +++$+++ Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
c25686 +++$+++ Doc--!
c05725 +++$+++ What's your name?
c05725 +++$+++ Me? Willie Long.
c05725 +++$+++ That's a long story...
c24013 +++$+++ If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
c24013 +++$+++ How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
c24013 +++$+++ I'm ready!
c10174 +++$+++ Everybody's got to be somewhere.
c10174 +++$+++ What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
c10174 +++$+++ It would have been really embarrassing!
c10174 +++$+++ How did you know this was my car?
c10174 +++$+++ Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
c10174 +++$+++ And I asked someone. CHARLIE You think you're pretty smart.
c00482 +++$+++ Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
c00482 +++$+++ I don't want to live anymore.
c00482 +++$+++ Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
c00482 +++$+++ What?
c00482 +++$+++ That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
c00482 +++$+++ I'm sure.
c26472 +++$+++ Some fucker's shootin' at us.
c26472 +++$+++ Yeah.
c26472 +++$+++ Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
c05135 +++$+++ So, what do you think we should do?
c05135 +++$+++ I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
c05135 +++$+++ Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
c05135 +++$+++ So that's cool with you, then?
c05135 +++$+++ Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
c05135 +++$+++ I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
c05135 +++$+++ I'll see you at school, O.K.?
c04753 +++$+++ On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
c04753 +++$+++ She hasn't had a thing yesterday--or today.
c04753 +++$+++ Been sending her meals in regularly?
c04753 +++$+++ Yessir. She refuses them all.
c04753 +++$+++ Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
c04753 +++$+++ Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
c20582 +++$+++ Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
c20582 +++$+++ No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
c20582 +++$+++ Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
c20582 +++$+++ Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
c20582 +++$+++ I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
c20582 +++$+++ I'm definitely traveling some day.
c25526 +++$+++ She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
c25526 +++$+++ Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
c25526 +++$+++ That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
c25526 +++$+++ I didn't mean you, Mister.
c03381 +++$+++ This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
c03381 +++$+++ You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
c03381 +++$+++ Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
c03381 +++$+++ Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
c03381 +++$+++ To go into business for ourselves.
c21599 +++$+++ He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
c21599 +++$+++ We know everything.
c21599 +++$+++ I hope he can prove it.  Come on. You don't want to get pneumonia.
c09144 +++$+++ If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
c09144 +++$+++ Now, you make a toast.
c09144 +++$+++ New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
c20863 +++$+++ And we really do have to talk.
c20863 +++$+++ You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
c20863 +++$+++ I had to limit your options.
c20863 +++$+++ And Linda...
c20863 +++$+++ You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
c20863 +++$+++ I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
c20863 +++$+++ Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
c20863 +++$+++ Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
c20863 +++$+++ I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
c20863 +++$+++ Why would you want me to kill you?
c20863 +++$+++ Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
c20863 +++$+++ No, It's you that is full of shit. And blood. And bones. A typically imperfect organic being. You've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
c26175 +++$+++ I love Janis.
c26175 +++$+++ You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
c26175 +++$+++ She OD'd, didn't she?
c26175 +++$+++ Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
c26175 +++$+++ You mean she got a bad batch?
c26175 +++$+++ That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
c26175 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c13887 +++$+++ How much do you owe me, Curly?
c13887 +++$+++ Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
c13887 +++$+++ Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
c13887 +++$+++ I don't know...
c13887 +++$+++ I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
c13887 +++$+++ Plus what I owe you?
c13887 +++$+++ Okay, you got yourself a boat.
c00526 +++$+++ Which one is that?  Raw what?
c00526 +++$+++ This is mole.  It's good.
c00526 +++$+++ Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
c24320 +++$+++ ... so when your dad said, "I never want to see your "f-'in' faces again!" do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up?
c24320 +++$+++ I don't know... And what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table.
c24320 +++$+++ Well, if I had to guess...  I'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who's going to be a daddy of his own...  Jack, do you know what I see here?
c24320 +++$+++ Spit from your dad?
c24320 +++$+++ I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
c24320 +++$+++ Yeah.
c24320 +++$+++ So, while we're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty "stinky" - in the long run, we're going to grow strong from this.
c24320 +++$+++ Y'think?
c24320 +++$+++ I sure do.
c24320 +++$+++ Oh, Jack...
c19040 +++$+++ How big is Tibet's army?
c19040 +++$+++ Roughly five thousand men.
c19040 +++$+++ Is that big?
c19040 +++$+++ The Regent is adding men. And he bought rifles and ammunition from India. Mountain guns, too.
c18707 +++$+++ I dunno what I can do to help you?
c18707 +++$+++ I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
c18707 +++$+++ Screw Citrine. He can fire me.
c03433 +++$+++ Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
c03433 +++$+++ What?
c03433 +++$+++ I don't understand --
c03433 +++$+++ Did you say rape her?
c03433 +++$+++ -- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
c03433 +++$+++ What did she say?
c03433 +++$+++ You've got to tell me what she said.
c23877 +++$+++ We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
c23877 +++$+++ The three of us.
c23877 +++$+++ Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
c19754 +++$+++ I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
c19754 +++$+++ What do you want?
c19754 +++$+++ You know Lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. My attorney should have brought that our in court.
c19754 +++$+++ I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. If you've got something to say, Lecktor, say it.
c19754 +++$+++ I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
c19754 +++$+++ When you were so depressed after you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death, it wasn't the act that got you down. Didn't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  And why shouldn't it feel good?! It must feel good to God. God does it all the time!
c21225 +++$+++ The moon sinks lower into the hills!  We must hurry to the finish.
c21225 +++$+++ I will decide the conclusion.
c21225 +++$+++ You had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session.
c21225 +++$+++ Then cancel my order.
c21225 +++$+++ The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
c21225 +++$+++ There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
c21225 +++$+++ Oh, if there is only time!
c21225 +++$+++ All others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff, compared to <i>her</i>  This one would have <i>died</i> for feathers, furs, and fluff...and so she did!
c05647 +++$+++ I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
c05647 +++$+++ You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
c05647 +++$+++ A blueprint spool.
c05647 +++$+++ Where have you been for a week?!
c05647 +++$+++ Four days.  I left to think.
c05647 +++$+++ What did you do with your dog?
c05647 +++$+++ Kurt's been feeding him.
c05647 +++$+++ I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.
c05553 +++$+++ Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
c05553 +++$+++ Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
c05553 +++$+++ Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
c21493 +++$+++ He can pilot?
c21493 +++$+++ Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down.
c21493 +++$+++ He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
c15162 +++$+++ Hey!  I'm tryin' to help you.
c15162 +++$+++ I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.
c15162 +++$+++ You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
c15162 +++$+++ Oh, Jesus!  You want to be a martyr or a hero or what?
c06344 +++$+++ Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
c06344 +++$+++ Shh!
c06344 +++$+++ What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
c06344 +++$+++ What?
c06344 +++$+++ Out the window! Something just flew by!
c06344 +++$+++ Well, don't stand there, you idiot. Go and look. Open the window. Oh, why did he have to pick on my building?
c23314 +++$+++ The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
c23314 +++$+++ No problem.
c23314 +++$+++ Like to who?
c10352 +++$+++ You know, I never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, Teresa's arm went completely dead.
c10352 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c10352 +++$+++ Thanks.
c09589 +++$+++ Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
c09589 +++$+++ Why?
c09589 +++$+++ I kinda thought I might make a good one. I'm very observant.
c09589 +++$+++ I was in the Army too.  And I'm good with crowds.
c18307 +++$+++ Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
c18307 +++$+++ It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
c18307 +++$+++ What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
c18307 +++$+++ Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
c18307 +++$+++ I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
c17912 +++$+++ How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
c17912 +++$+++ In a word? Lucrative.
c17912 +++$+++ The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
c17912 +++$+++ Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
c17912 +++$+++ You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
c17912 +++$+++ What?
c17912 +++$+++ Really? Why?
c04696 +++$+++ I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
c04696 +++$+++ I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
c04696 +++$+++ And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
c04696 +++$+++ I want... I want to...
c01040 +++$+++ Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
c01040 +++$+++ Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
c01040 +++$+++ Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
c05296 +++$+++ Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
c05296 +++$+++ Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
c05296 +++$+++ To get your attention.
c05296 +++$+++ No, only the path she chose to travel.
c24637 +++$+++ When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
c24637 +++$+++ Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
c24637 +++$+++ That's a nice tour.  All booked?  When was Susie around here last?
c24637 +++$+++ Four five nights ago.  That's how I know the romance is off.  Also Steve's in a very bad mood.
c24637 +++$+++ I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
c27293 +++$+++ Are you saying...Renard is the man who's trying to kill me?
c27293 +++$+++ You can drop the act, it's over.
c27293 +++$+++ I think you do.
c05192 +++$+++ Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
c05192 +++$+++ Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
c05192 +++$+++ He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
c05192 +++$+++ Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
c05192 +++$+++ Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
c05192 +++$+++ There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
c05192 +++$+++ I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
c05192 +++$+++ Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
c05192 +++$+++ Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
c05192 +++$+++ I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
c05192 +++$+++ Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
c18813 +++$+++ We can't stay in here!
c18813 +++$+++ We're sure as hell not going back out there"
c18813 +++$+++ This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
c18813 +++$+++ For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at this!  You could-
c09777 +++$+++ You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
c09777 +++$+++ It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
c09777 +++$+++ I would like to explain something of my mission here.
c09777 +++$+++ That was my first question.
c09777 +++$+++ It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
c09777 +++$+++ Yes -- that is true.
c09777 +++$+++ In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
c09777 +++$+++ If you mean that you are afraid of us--
c09777 +++$+++ We want to be sure you don't make -- let us say -- an unfortunate mistake. We know the potentiality of these developments and we are disturbed to find them in the hands of children... You see, we've had atomic energy for five thousand of your years.  We discarded instruments like this many centuries ago.  So long as you were limited to fighting among yourselves -- with your primitive tanks and planes -- we were unconcerned. But soon you will apply atomic energy to space ships -- and then you become a threat to the peace and security of other planets. That, of course, we cannot tolerate.
c09777 +++$+++ These other planets -- do they have peace and security?
c09777 +++$+++ We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
c09777 +++$+++ We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
c09777 +++$+++ I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
c09777 +++$+++ What I have to say must be said to all concerned.  It is too important to be entrusted to any individual.
c04359 +++$+++ I'll beat him the next game.
c04359 +++$+++ How're the hands?
c04359 +++$+++ Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
c26587 +++$+++ Are you with me...are you awake...?
c26587 +++$+++ Yeah.  I'm awake.
c26587 +++$+++ Rooney's protecting someone.  Who is she protecting?
c26587 +++$+++ The Doctors.
c26587 +++$+++ Read me what she said.
c06763 +++$+++ I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
c06763 +++$+++ But you're a superhero.
c06763 +++$+++ The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
c06763 +++$+++ But in fact... you'd found it.
c00306 +++$+++ What's next?
c00306 +++$+++ I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
c00306 +++$+++ Nope.
c06647 +++$+++ The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera!
c06647 +++$+++ I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
c06647 +++$+++ Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
c06647 +++$+++ Me?!
c06647 +++$+++ Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
c04452 +++$+++ With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
c04452 +++$+++ I had a feeling you would.
c04452 +++$+++ Then God help us.
c11073 +++$+++ You need new girdles.
c11073 +++$+++ Buy some.
c11073 +++$+++ The same size?
c11073 +++$+++ Well. I guess a real tight girdle help when you're playin' a lunatic.
c14854 +++$+++ I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
c14854 +++$+++ Is that everybody?
c14854 +++$+++ Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
c14854 +++$+++ What about her.
c14854 +++$+++ Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
c14854 +++$+++ And...
c14854 +++$+++ I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
c14854 +++$+++ Fine.
c14854 +++$+++ I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
c09873 +++$+++ Right up your alley, I would think. You are from the past, yes?
c09873 +++$+++ How did you know?!
c09873 +++$+++ I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
c09873 +++$+++ 1899.
c09873 +++$+++ I must say, you look remarkably good.  You don't want a book then?
c09873 +++$+++ What are you?
c09873 +++$+++ I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
c09873 +++$+++ An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...
c10964 +++$+++ Oh... God... am I cold...
c10964 +++$+++ Is that you, Roby?
c10964 +++$+++ Yeah, it's you all right.
c04522 +++$+++ Arrrgh!
c04522 +++$+++ It wasn't him.
c04522 +++$+++ Who was it?
c04522 +++$+++ Me.
c04522 +++$+++ Al.
c19528 +++$+++ Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
c19528 +++$+++ I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
c19528 +++$+++ You don't wanna hurt your back.
c19528 +++$+++ Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
c19528 +++$+++ Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
c25158 +++$+++ That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal.
c25158 +++$+++ You could do it.
c25158 +++$+++ You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy.
c07137 +++$+++ No money in his room there?
c07137 +++$+++ Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
c07137 +++$+++ I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
c07137 +++$+++ It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs.  It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to?
c07137 +++$+++ Yes.
c07137 +++$+++ If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
c07137 +++$+++ Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
c07137 +++$+++ Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more.
c12426 +++$+++ This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.
c12426 +++$+++ If it's hard for you, might kill me dead.
c12426 +++$+++ I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
c12426 +++$+++ For what?
c12426 +++$+++ You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
c12426 +++$+++ Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
c12426 +++$+++ Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
c12426 +++$+++ Just me.
c12426 +++$+++ Oh yeah. I got big plans.
c07726 +++$+++ I forgot about that.
c07726 +++$+++ Can I come home with you when we get there?
c07726 +++$+++ Yeah.
c07726 +++$+++ I thought that you were anyway.
c22340 +++$+++ Let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  We'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
c22340 +++$+++ I hate it when you talk like this.  Go on.
c22340 +++$+++ It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
c26658 +++$+++ How's your love life, Midge?
c26658 +++$+++ That's following a train of thought.
c26658 +++$+++ Well?
c26658 +++$+++ Normal.
c26658 +++$+++ Aren't you ever going to get married?
c26658 +++$+++ You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
c26658 +++$+++ Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
c26658 +++$+++ Three whole weeks.
c26658 +++$+++ Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
c26658 +++$+++ Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
c26658 +++$+++ I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back.  It's a Mission number.
c26658 +++$+++ That's Skid Row... isn't it?
c26658 +++$+++ Could be.
c26658 +++$+++ He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
c26658 +++$+++ Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight.
c26658 +++$+++ Sorry, old man. Work.
c26658 +++$+++ Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
c26658 +++$+++ What.
c26658 +++$+++ My... the acrophobia.
c26658 +++$+++ I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
c26658 +++$+++ I think I can lick it.
c26658 +++$+++ I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
c03983 +++$+++ I just wanted to be sure you were O.K.
c03983 +++$+++ Never better. You sleep well.
c03983 +++$+++ Yeah.
c03983 +++$+++ I love you too.
c20715 +++$+++ Have your children been deaf since birth?
c20715 +++$+++ Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
c20715 +++$+++ When did you start singing?
c20715 +++$+++ When I was little, in church.
c20715 +++$+++ Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
c20715 +++$+++ Yes, it is --
c20715 +++$+++ Well, can you tell me why?
c20715 +++$+++ It just is.
c20715 +++$+++ How long have you been with them?
c20715 +++$+++ About three years.
c20715 +++$+++ And before?
c20715 +++$+++ Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
c20715 +++$+++ Do you ever do any writing?
c20715 +++$+++ No, I don't.
c20715 +++$+++ Are you a close friend of Haven's?
c20715 +++$+++ No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
c20715 +++$+++ He's a member of our congregation.
c18049 +++$+++ Do not underestimate the power of your heart.  Your dreams live there.
c18049 +++$+++ My dreams died long ago.
c18049 +++$+++ Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
c18049 +++$+++ And now it's time to come out of the shadows.
c23512 +++$+++ ...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  And it's brand new.  Unlike the rest.
c23512 +++$+++ And the next one...?
c23512 +++$+++ From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
c23512 +++$+++ Found on Carl's boat, too.  Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.
c04265 +++$+++ What are you doing!
c04265 +++$+++ I gotta open the gate.
c04265 +++$+++ It won't work.
c03133 +++$+++ I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
c03133 +++$+++ You thought I was faking?
c03133 +++$+++ Oh.
c20501 +++$+++ Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
c20501 +++$+++ Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
c20501 +++$+++ Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
c20501 +++$+++ I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
c20501 +++$+++ Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
c20501 +++$+++ Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
c20501 +++$+++ I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
c20501 +++$+++ Thank you , sir. Sir, may I ask you a question ?
c20501 +++$+++ Of course.
c20501 +++$+++ While I am not morally against these little, shall we say "hobbies", as long as I am on the payroll, but why not something like a yacht club ?
c20501 +++$+++ Zach, how old are you, son ?
c20501 +++$+++ I am thirty two.
c20501 +++$+++ And how much do we pay you annually ?
c20501 +++$+++ I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
c20501 +++$+++ Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
c20501 +++$+++ Yes sir.
c20501 +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
c07085 +++$+++ This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
c07085 +++$+++ But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
c07085 +++$+++ By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
c07085 +++$+++ So President Kennedy thought.
c13680 +++$+++ Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
c13680 +++$+++ Hurling --
c13680 +++$+++ Hurling --
c14434 +++$+++ You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
c14434 +++$+++ Right.
c14434 +++$+++ Right.
c17273 +++$+++ Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself
c17273 +++$+++ She was the only "Annie" you could find?
c17273 +++$+++ Yeah, well ... She lives with District Court Judge Seymour Croft ...
c24040 +++$+++ Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
c24040 +++$+++ He should be put in jail.
c24040 +++$+++ Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
c24040 +++$+++ You should.
c24040 +++$+++ I had a witness I would.
c24040 +++$+++ A witness to what...?
c24040 +++$+++ You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
c24040 +++$+++ You mean <u>with White</u>...?
c24040 +++$+++ What?
c24040 +++$+++ You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
c24040 +++$+++ Who's White...?
c24040 +++$+++ The writer.
c24040 +++$+++ He saw the accident...?
c24040 +++$+++ Sure.
c24040 +++$+++ You bet he did.
c15539 +++$+++ What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night?!
c15539 +++$+++ They shot him in his library.
c15539 +++$+++ I don't want a floor plan; I want to know who!  Who's taking the ticket for this, Johnny?
c15539 +++$+++ Nobody.  At least not yet.
c15539 +++$+++ And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
c15539 +++$+++ Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper!
c00366 +++$+++ ...if Jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
c00366 +++$+++ Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
c00366 +++$+++ You don't believe me?
c00366 +++$+++ About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
c00366 +++$+++ I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
c00366 +++$+++ As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.
c06910 +++$+++ AAA-MENN!
c06910 +++$+++ You have all sinned!
c06910 +++$+++ But which one of you can say as I can say: I drove a good man to murder because I kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
c12253 +++$+++ You don't have a key?
c12253 +++$+++ Maybe Charles does.
c12253 +++$+++ Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
c15168 +++$+++ You don't smoke ... why do you want to start now.
c15168 +++$+++ Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked?
c15168 +++$+++ I used to, but I stopped.
c15168 +++$+++ You stopped?  Why?
c15168 +++$+++ You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer.  Gimme the cigarette.
c01289 +++$+++ What are you doing out here?
c01289 +++$+++ Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
c01289 +++$+++ Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
c01289 +++$+++ Think it'll work?
c01289 +++$+++ Want company?
c18345 +++$+++ Talking to me, dad?
c18345 +++$+++ Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
c18345 +++$+++ I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
c16807 +++$+++ Guys ready to order?
c16807 +++$+++ Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
c16807 +++$+++ Elliot?
c16807 +++$+++ Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
c22051 +++$+++ I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated.
c22051 +++$+++ Gonorrhea?
c22051 +++$+++ Don't worry, Madam, she can't infect your dear little kiddies. She long ago fully recovered, but the disease did irreparable damage. The girl is permanently barren.
c22051 +++$+++ Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
c22051 +++$+++ We make our own lives, Madam. As for malignancy, I don't think so, it's very unlikely. I probably shouldn't have even mentioned that possibility to her.
c22051 +++$+++ She's an adult, Mrs. Hillyer, I was merely giving her the facts.
c10435 +++$+++ Is it over?
c10435 +++$+++ No.
c10435 +++$+++ I don't have a goddamned idea.
c15982 +++$+++ You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
c15982 +++$+++ I've seen him.
c15982 +++$+++ You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
c15982 +++$+++ Only what I read in the papers.
c15982 +++$+++ Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
c15982 +++$+++ I once did a paper on it
c15982 +++$+++ Really?
c15982 +++$+++ From the psychiatric end.
c15982 +++$+++ I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church...you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
c15982 +++$+++ Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
c15982 +++$+++ And Dennings, you read how he died?
c15982 +++$+++ Yeah, a fall.
c15982 +++$+++ Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
c15982 +++$+++ Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
c15982 +++$+++ It's possible. Possible however...
c15982 +++$+++ Unlikely.
c15982 +++$+++ Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
c15982 +++$+++ You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
c15982 +++$+++ Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
c15982 +++$+++ Sick priest, is that it?
c15982 +++$+++ Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
c15982 +++$+++ I don't know anyone who fits the description.
c15982 +++$+++ Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
c15982 +++$+++ No I probably wouldn't.
c15982 +++$+++ Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California was thrown in jail for not telling the judge what he knew about a patient.
c15982 +++$+++ Is that a threat?
c15982 +++$+++ Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
c20635 +++$+++ Daddy??!?!?!
c20635 +++$+++ Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
c20635 +++$+++ Where's Daddy?
c20635 +++$+++ Well he just left, what's wrong?
c20635 +++$+++ I'm hemorrhaging.
c20635 +++$+++ I don't want, I don't need your help....
c06100 +++$+++ 1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
c06100 +++$+++ You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
c06100 +++$+++ Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at you. I said to combinate me.
c06100 +++$+++ The bitch was there.
c01253 +++$+++ Why not?
c01253 +++$+++ I asked for a policeman.
c01253 +++$+++ You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
c01253 +++$+++ It's... too slow.
c01253 +++$+++ Well, it's a game of anticipation, that's the beauty.
c01253 +++$+++ What do you like then?
c17090 +++$+++ Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
c17090 +++$+++ But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
c17090 +++$+++ Three business days.  They mean three business days.
c17090 +++$+++ Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
c17090 +++$+++ That's what they are.  Three business...I wait till Monday, my time limit runs out.
c24928 +++$+++ ...How you today, Ed?
c24928 +++$+++ OK.
c24928 +++$+++ You don't got a headache?
c24928 +++$+++ Damn, I got a headache to beat the band.
c11992 +++$+++ When did you write it?
c11992 +++$+++ You mean did I write it before my parents died?
c11992 +++$+++ No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
c21334 +++$+++ How's everything?
c21334 +++$+++ We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
c21334 +++$+++ That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
c21334 +++$+++ I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
c13513 +++$+++ Hey, you're anti-male.
c13513 +++$+++ Oh Frank, I'm not anti-male, I'm anti- you. Believe me, there's a difference.  Kelly is designing new uniforms for next week. Pay her and thank her. And is it a rule that the hottest places on the planet have the coldest air conditioning.  There's something out there called 73 degrees, look into it.
c13513 +++$+++ What if I were to say "You're Fired?"
c13513 +++$+++ Kelly, get to work on those new uniforms.  I'm not running a summer camp here..
c03996 +++$+++ What are you doing?
c03996 +++$+++ I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
c03996 +++$+++ Public Enemy!  All I'm trying to do is cheer us up.  Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
c03996 +++$+++ I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
c03996 +++$+++ But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
c03996 +++$+++ Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
c03996 +++$+++ Don't you want to hear what's next?
c03996 +++$+++ What's next?
c03996 +++$+++ Play it.
c03996 +++$+++ "Little Latin Lupe Lu."
c11279 +++$+++ Two minutes, Alvy.
c11279 +++$+++ No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
c11279 +++$+++ In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
c11279 +++$+++ Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
c15911 +++$+++ Good day to you, sir.
c15911 +++$+++ Move aside. This is the King's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.
c15911 +++$+++ I await the King himself. His knights are in need of training.
c15911 +++$+++ I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
c15911 +++$+++ I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
c15911 +++$+++ --That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
c15911 +++$+++ Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
c15911 +++$+++ I will not. You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of God.
c04498 +++$+++ Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
c04498 +++$+++ Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
c04498 +++$+++ They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
c07059 +++$+++ It's the President's personal property!  I will never give up my tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!
c07059 +++$+++ This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
c07059 +++$+++ Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
c07059 +++$+++ Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
c07059 +++$+++ Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
c07059 +++$+++ For what?!
c18102 +++$+++ When this phone rings, you answer.  It will be me.  I'll tell you what to do. When I have what I want, you get your family.
c18102 +++$+++ You want . . . Marlon and Al.
c18102 +++$+++ I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
c18102 +++$+++ Smith will know.
c22309 +++$+++ I should kill you right here! I never thought you'd do this to me but I guess there's a lot I didn't know about you!
c22309 +++$+++ Dwayne listen to me -
c22309 +++$+++ Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
c22309 +++$+++ Don't lie to me!!!!
c22246 +++$+++ O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
c22246 +++$+++ I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
c22246 +++$+++ I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
c22246 +++$+++ What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
c22246 +++$+++ How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
c22246 +++$+++ Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
c22246 +++$+++ But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
c22246 +++$+++ Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
c22246 +++$+++ I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
c22246 +++$+++ Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
c22246 +++$+++ Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
c22246 +++$+++ O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
c22246 +++$+++ Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
c22246 +++$+++ Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
c22246 +++$+++ Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
c01377 +++$+++ Lazarus?
c01377 +++$+++ Oh! Gave me a start.
c01377 +++$+++ I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
c01377 +++$+++ You hurt it?
c01377 +++$+++ I'm standing most of my day. They're for support.  Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
c01377 +++$+++ Well. It's good to see you.
c24100 +++$+++ You bet you are.
c24100 +++$+++ How the hell would you know?
c24100 +++$+++ How would you know <u>anything</u>?
c24929 +++$+++ This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
c24929 +++$+++ Yeah.
c24929 +++$+++ Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
c24929 +++$+++ Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
c24929 +++$+++ I don't care what it costs! This is when ya come together!
c24929 +++$+++ The hell with it, Eddie!
c00600 +++$+++ Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
c00600 +++$+++ What is it?
c00600 +++$+++ Ah! By all means.
c21463 +++$+++ Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?
c21463 +++$+++ Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
c21463 +++$+++ Get a life.
c23653 +++$+++ Mister, can you visit anybody here?
c23653 +++$+++ Gotta wait 'til visitin' days.
c23653 +++$+++ When's that?
c23653 +++$+++ Sunday...
c23653 +++$+++ Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
c21740 +++$+++ Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
c21740 +++$+++ Television?
c21740 +++$+++ Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
c21740 +++$+++ Uh-uh.  No work.
c05319 +++$+++ You ready?
c05319 +++$+++ For what?
c05319 +++$+++ You told me you'd take me over to Seattle today.
c05319 +++$+++ But you promised.
c20710 +++$+++ Wrecks.
c20710 +++$+++ Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
c20710 +++$+++ Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
c27294 +++$+++ Valentin Zukovsky.
c27294 +++$+++ BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
c27294 +++$+++ You, of course. I need some information.
c27294 +++$+++ Bond, I'm a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family's, now it's mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
c27294 +++$+++ Have some of the rat's nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House.
c02929 +++$+++ Can't complain, ma'am.
c02929 +++$+++ Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
c02929 +++$+++ Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered.  But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
c22954 +++$+++ Perfect example.
c22954 +++$+++ You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
c22954 +++$+++ I don't know why I asked you to come.
c22954 +++$+++ Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
c22954 +++$+++ He mentioned it.
c13426 +++$+++ She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.
c13426 +++$+++ You get down here!
c13426 +++$+++ Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
c24064 +++$+++ I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?
c24064 +++$+++ Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
c24064 +++$+++ I don't want that to happen.  Why would I want that to happen?
c24064 +++$+++ Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
c24064 +++$+++ Mass hysteria.
c24064 +++$+++ Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
c24064 +++$+++ Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
c16753 +++$+++ Why do you do these stupid things?!
c16753 +++$+++ I have to.
c16753 +++$+++ You don't "have to."
c16753 +++$+++ I just want you to like me.
c16753 +++$+++ I do like you.  But not when you act like a jerk.
c16753 +++$+++ Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
c16753 +++$+++ I never said you were "nothing".
c16753 +++$+++ You're wrong.
c18775 +++$+++ Oh, tell the story.
c18775 +++$+++ --so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
c18775 +++$+++ Gorgeous.
c18775 +++$+++ A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
c18775 +++$+++ That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
c18775 +++$+++ Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
c18775 +++$+++ To the pools?
c18775 +++$+++ Oh no -- _ 14.
c18434 +++$+++ I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
c18434 +++$+++ I tried...
c18434 +++$+++ You have it...
c14577 +++$+++ Go ahead.
c14577 +++$+++ Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
c14577 +++$+++ Why do you want to teach me?
c14577 +++$+++ I've always wanted a disciple worthy of Wudan's secrets.
c14577 +++$+++ That's a risk I'm willing to take. Deep down, you're good.  Even Jade Fox couldn't corrupt you.
c06019 +++$+++ I said no touching.
c06019 +++$+++ Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
c06019 +++$+++ Get your hands off of her.
c06019 +++$+++ Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
c06019 +++$+++ Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
c08028 +++$+++ Well, I don't know about that --
c08028 +++$+++ Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
c08028 +++$+++ Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
c08028 +++$+++ And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
c08028 +++$+++ We'll have more fun in Detroit.
c08028 +++$+++ Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
c20924 +++$+++ So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
c20924 +++$+++ What about it?
c20924 +++$+++ You two got a thing going, or what?
c20924 +++$+++ She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
c20924 +++$+++ She giving you any carfare for the ride?
c20924 +++$+++ Naw. Just killing time.
c04620 +++$+++ A gun? Yes.
c04620 +++$+++ What caliber is your gun?
c04620 +++$+++ What caliber is my gun?
c04620 +++$+++ What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
c00797 +++$+++ Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
c00797 +++$+++ Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
c00797 +++$+++ That he was.
c00797 +++$+++ They're making him a hero now.
c00797 +++$+++ Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
c00797 +++$+++ But he killed a lot of men, too.
c00797 +++$+++ Can't argue that.
c00797 +++$+++ I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
c19946 +++$+++ Why did you go to the hospital?
c19946 +++$+++ I don't know.
c19946 +++$+++ You were just curious?
c19946 +++$+++ I guess...
c19946 +++$+++ About Susan?
c19946 +++$+++ I wouldn't put it that way.
c19946 +++$+++ What way would you put it?
c19946 +++$+++ You tell me, Bill.
c19946 +++$+++ Are you going to fire me, Bill?
c26503 +++$+++ You set up the line-up.
c26503 +++$+++ Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
c26503 +++$+++ Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
c13333 +++$+++ You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
c13333 +++$+++ Go for it.
c13333 +++$+++ I won't have to.
c27021 +++$+++ Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
c27021 +++$+++ ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
c27021 +++$+++ 'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
c09681 +++$+++ Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
c09681 +++$+++ Do I sound foolish to you?
c09681 +++$+++ No.
c09681 +++$+++ I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
c09681 +++$+++ Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
c09681 +++$+++ I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
c09681 +++$+++ I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
c09681 +++$+++ Annie's there. She'll be all right.
c09681 +++$+++ I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
c09681 +++$+++ I wish I could be that way.
c15326 +++$+++ Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
c15326 +++$+++ That's good.  I could use the money.
c15326 +++$+++ But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
c15326 +++$+++ Of course!
c05531 +++$+++ What you do, boy?  You be velly solly, come here intellupt my sleep.
c05531 +++$+++ I didn't know... I --
c05531 +++$+++ What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
c05531 +++$+++ I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
c05531 +++$+++ You come stealee tleasoo?
c05531 +++$+++ Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
c05531 +++$+++ No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
c05531 +++$+++ Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
c05531 +++$+++ Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
c05531 +++$+++ Cathay?
c05531 +++$+++ Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
c05531 +++$+++ East of Mercia?
c05531 +++$+++ You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
c05531 +++$+++ You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
c05531 +++$+++ Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
c05531 +++$+++ Then you'll understand my quest.  An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn.  The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter.  Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
c05531 +++$+++ Flozen foleva not good.
c05531 +++$+++ It's terrible.
c05531 +++$+++ An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
c05531 +++$+++ I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
c05531 +++$+++ Oh no... Don't you understand?
c21704 +++$+++ Who's the girl?
c21704 +++$+++ Catch of the day.
c21704 +++$+++ Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
c21704 +++$+++ People are expendable to Bodhi.
c21704 +++$+++ Meaning you were expendable.
c21704 +++$+++ We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
c21704 +++$+++ Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
c11071 +++$+++ Don't run away, Bill.
c11071 +++$+++ From what would I be running?
c11071 +++$+++ You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
c11071 +++$+++ I'm for it.
c11071 +++$+++ Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
c11071 +++$+++ When I told you what every young actress should know.
c11071 +++$+++ When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
c11071 +++$+++ Your make-up's a little heavy.
c11071 +++$+++ - and for you.
c11071 +++$+++ You're quite a girl.
c11071 +++$+++ You think?
c11071 +++$+++ I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
c11071 +++$+++ You hear all kinds of things.
c11071 +++$+++ I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
c11071 +++$+++ Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
c06293 +++$+++ If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
c06293 +++$+++ Tell me the whole story, Walt.
c06293 +++$+++ There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
c06293 +++$+++ You noticed. I wasn't going to fool around over here. I've got these three girls I'm engaged to back home...
c16800 +++$+++ I had a skiing accident in high school, broke my left leg. It took three winters before I would even look at the snow again...but the solution kept eluding me.  I finally took lessons. I've never broken a bone since.
c16800 +++$+++ It's not that simple.
c16800 +++$+++ Whenever I get near the water, I see this young boy drowning. He tries to pull me down with him.
c16095 +++$+++ I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
c16095 +++$+++ Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
c16095 +++$+++ Oh.
c18589 +++$+++ Aren't you suiting up, mate?
c18589 +++$+++ No.
c18589 +++$+++ Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
c18589 +++$+++ She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
c18589 +++$+++ Never know down there.  Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
c18589 +++$+++ Me?  I don't know.  Twenty, thirty.  I love them, think they're the greatest.
c05989 +++$+++ According to the Sentry, Anderton was watching this at Containment right before he was tagged.
c05989 +++$+++ I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
c05989 +++$+++ I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
c05989 +++$+++ Danny, tell me what you're thinking.
c05989 +++$+++ How?
c08782 +++$+++ How long you going away for?
c08782 +++$+++ Long enough.
c08782 +++$+++ "To"... Forget about you.
c05501 +++$+++ I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
c05501 +++$+++ Licensed attorney or family member?
c05501 +++$+++ Uh -- family.
c05501 +++$+++ Relation?
c05501 +++$+++ I'm her sister.
c05501 +++$+++ Delta. Gamma.
c07774 +++$+++ Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
c07774 +++$+++ Shut down?
c07774 +++$+++ In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
c07774 +++$+++ But he's one among some two hundred wards --
c07774 +++$+++ Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
c07774 +++$+++ Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
c07774 +++$+++ You're a sentimental man.
c07774 +++$+++ You find this amusing, do you?
c24250 +++$+++ You make videos?
c24250 +++$+++ Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
c24250 +++$+++ You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
c24250 +++$+++ "Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
c24250 +++$+++ You could do it.
c24250 +++$+++ I could.
c24250 +++$+++ Yeah!
c24250 +++$+++ Yeah.
c24250 +++$+++ I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
c24250 +++$+++ Yes!
c24250 +++$+++ A reel?
c07393 +++$+++ Why didn't you tell us about the party you boys were planning at the capitol?
c07393 +++$+++ Shit man. It was... you know spontaneous.
c07393 +++$+++ Spontaneous my ass!! You told the press and you don't tell me. Remember you're working for us.
c07393 +++$+++ Are you fucking with me? You smartass piece of shit...
c20538 +++$+++ Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
c20538 +++$+++ More than anything in the world.
c20538 +++$+++ It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
c20538 +++$+++ Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
c20538 +++$+++ Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
c20538 +++$+++ I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
c20538 +++$+++ I'd say you turned out just fine.
c20538 +++$+++ I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
c20538 +++$+++ Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
c20538 +++$+++ Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
c18261 +++$+++ ...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
c18261 +++$+++ Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
c18261 +++$+++ The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
c18261 +++$+++ -- these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely, et cetera.
c24257 +++$+++ I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
c24257 +++$+++ What was your name again?
c24257 +++$+++ Erica.
c24257 +++$+++ Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
c24257 +++$+++ Deep down. Way down.
c24257 +++$+++ It's a mistake to think that.
c24257 +++$+++ We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
c24257 +++$+++ It's nice to do a lot of things.
c24257 +++$+++ That's what I mean.
c24257 +++$+++ I'm not a nice guy.
c24257 +++$+++ I know. It's okay.
c24257 +++$+++ Yeah?
c24257 +++$+++ Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
c24257 +++$+++ Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
c04248 +++$+++ Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
c04248 +++$+++ You might still have a house.
c04248 +++$+++ Look after yourself, Grace.
c23522 +++$+++ Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
c23522 +++$+++ I don't think so.
c23522 +++$+++ You don't.  <u>Think</u> so.
c23522 +++$+++ You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.
c12669 +++$+++ Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
c12669 +++$+++ uh uh.
c12669 +++$+++ uh uh.
c06598 +++$+++ I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
c06598 +++$+++ What did they say?
c06598 +++$+++ Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
c06598 +++$+++ What did they say?
c06598 +++$+++ Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
c06598 +++$+++ Do you always wear your hair like that?
c25018 +++$+++ I'm looking for anything out of the ordinary. Maybe something from the FEMA offices where the bodies were found.
c25018 +++$+++ We weren't expecting to find those remains, of course. They went right off to Washington.
c25018 +++$+++ Was there anything in those offices that didn't go to D.C.?
c25018 +++$+++ Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
c25018 +++$+++ No. Just fossils, far as I know.
c07986 +++$+++ Who's that?
c07986 +++$+++ Just a guard.
c07986 +++$+++ But you didn't hurt anybody.
c23016 +++$+++ Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
c23016 +++$+++ I liked the dog, for laughs.
c23016 +++$+++ But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
c23016 +++$+++ When the Queen commands it.
c23016 +++$+++ Be still.
c06309 +++$+++ But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
c06309 +++$+++ You were? I thought you were chasing me?
c06309 +++$+++ Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
c06309 +++$+++ Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you.
c09443 +++$+++ You tell us about America.
c09443 +++$+++ How do you know I come from America?
c09443 +++$+++ We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
c09443 +++$+++ Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
c09443 +++$+++ Hey America!  Is she as rich as they say?
c09443 +++$+++ Take me to America!  You need a good lupara in America?  You take me, I'll be the best man you got.  "Oh say, can you seeee...By da star early light..."
c20190 +++$+++ I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
c20190 +++$+++ At least you walked.
c20190 +++$+++ If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
c20190 +++$+++ Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
c20190 +++$+++ May I say something, no offence?  You look like a gigolo, you sound like a thief, you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind?
c20190 +++$+++ Working under adverse conditions.  Highly adverse conditions.
c20190 +++$+++ You didn't do that badly.
c00201 +++$+++ Yeah, right.  You want to try again?
c00201 +++$+++ Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
c00201 +++$+++ One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
c19521 +++$+++ What is this?
c19521 +++$+++ Uh, your earring?
c19521 +++$+++ What are you doing in my room?
c14174 +++$+++ Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
c14174 +++$+++ I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
c14174 +++$+++ Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
c14174 +++$+++ Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?
c14174 +++$+++ Much better, thank you, sir.
c14174 +++$+++ Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?
c14174 +++$+++ Fine, sir, fine.
c14174 +++$+++ Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
c14174 +++$+++ Thank you very much, sir.
c14174 +++$+++ But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
c14174 +++$+++ What would you like to know, sir?
c14174 +++$+++ Yes, sir. Rubinstein takes out a notebook.
c01667 +++$+++ Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
c01667 +++$+++ What?
c01667 +++$+++ You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
c11277 +++$+++ We've been through this.
c11277 +++$+++ If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
c11277 +++$+++ Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
c11277 +++$+++ Well, why not?
c11277 +++$+++ Yeah, Earl Warren?
c11277 +++$+++ Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
c11277 +++$+++ Lyndon Johnson?
c11277 +++$+++ L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
c11277 +++$+++ Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
c11277 +++$+++ The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
c22122 +++$+++ You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
c22122 +++$+++ Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
c22122 +++$+++ I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
c25117 +++$+++ What's a fascist?
c25117 +++$+++ I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
c25117 +++$+++ Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
c25117 +++$+++ The Zionists aren't Nazis.
c25117 +++$+++ They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories....
c25117 +++$+++ They had Sabra and Shattila.
c13714 +++$+++ Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
c13714 +++$+++ Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
c13714 +++$+++ You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
c13714 +++$+++ We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
c13714 +++$+++ Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
c13714 +++$+++ When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
c13714 +++$+++ Around one.
c13714 +++$+++ The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
c13714 +++$+++ Then how do I know this is your office?
c13714 +++$+++ Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
c13714 +++$+++ Bartholomew?
c13714 +++$+++ -- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
c13714 +++$+++ Starting with his own.
c13714 +++$+++ Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
c13714 +++$+++ What's your first name today?
c13714 +++$+++ Brian.
c13714 +++$+++ Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
c13714 +++$+++ Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
c13714 +++$+++ Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
c13714 +++$+++ Yes.
c13714 +++$+++ But you're -- divorced?
c13714 +++$+++ No.
c13714 +++$+++ Oh.
c13714 +++$+++ My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
c13714 +++$+++ Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
c13714 +++$+++ How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
c13714 +++$+++ Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
c13714 +++$+++ I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
c13714 +++$+++ You'd lie about anything.
c13714 +++$+++ Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
c13714 +++$+++ You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
c13714 +++$+++ I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
c13714 +++$+++ Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
c11218 +++$+++ This'll do.
c11218 +++$+++ Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
c11218 +++$+++ Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
c02689 +++$+++ Rum and ice, please.
c02689 +++$+++ You're another one of these California boys. Your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.
c02689 +++$+++ Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
c06935 +++$+++ Do you want more children, Willa?
c06935 +++$+++ I -- no, I --
c06935 +++$+++ Yes.
c15761 +++$+++ Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
c15761 +++$+++ Can't be too careful.
c15761 +++$+++ Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.
c00573 +++$+++ Oh, ha, ha, ha.
c00573 +++$+++ Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
c00573 +++$+++ Yes, you are. You're very sick.
c00573 +++$+++ No, no. Say it backwards, shit-wit. Sra-I'm-sick Say it backwards!
c00573 +++$+++ Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
c00573 +++$+++ Em iram! Em iram!
c00573 +++$+++ No, I'm not playing this game.
c00573 +++$+++ No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
c00573 +++$+++ No!
c00573 +++$+++ Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
c00573 +++$+++ Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
c00573 +++$+++ Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
c13506 +++$+++ Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
c13506 +++$+++ I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
c13506 +++$+++ Pass!
c13506 +++$+++ I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..
c06362 +++$+++ It rarely has to be done.
c06362 +++$+++ I've rarely shot anyone.
c06362 +++$+++ SWAT is a lifesaving unit, you know.
c06362 +++$+++ Try to remember that.
c04687 +++$+++ Getting married.
c04687 +++$+++ To him? He's a sick freak.
c04687 +++$+++ He's passionate.
c04687 +++$+++ Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
c04687 +++$+++ All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
c04687 +++$+++ Marylin! Listen to me.
c04687 +++$+++ No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
c04687 +++$+++ We told you. We realized we've always been in love.
c20648 +++$+++ Woah!!
c20648 +++$+++ What?
c20648 +++$+++ Pointing There's a beehive right there!
c20648 +++$+++ Stand back.
c10759 +++$+++ Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
c10759 +++$+++ I want to talk about it now.
c10759 +++$+++ We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
c10759 +++$+++ Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
c10759 +++$+++ Now I know. It's when I can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  That's my idea of being normal.
c05587 +++$+++ Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
c05587 +++$+++ You... you... you mortal you!
c05587 +++$+++ Please...
c05587 +++$+++ Threats won't make me love you.  Tis not the way of the human heart.
c07163 +++$+++ Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
c07163 +++$+++ No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
c07163 +++$+++ Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
c07163 +++$+++ She'll be all right?
c23062 +++$+++ What? Yes, that's fine.
c23062 +++$+++ You're sure? There's lots more.
c23062 +++$+++ No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
c23062 +++$+++ What's wrong?
c23062 +++$+++ Nothing.
c23062 +++$+++ You're not eating.
c23062 +++$+++ Not eating what?
c23062 +++$+++ If you give me the plate, I'll eat.
c03093 +++$+++ So, what, this Zimm guy asking for some kinda finders fee, that what we're talking about here?
c03093 +++$+++ Hey, Zimm doesn't ask for dick. Zimm tells you the way it is... or else.
c03093 +++$+++ Or else use your fucking imagination.
c02272 +++$+++ They suspended me for two days.
c02272 +++$+++ Are you okay?
c02272 +++$+++ I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
c02272 +++$+++ The old crazy woman who lives off Old Gun Road.
c26960 +++$+++ Does Norman know?
c26960 +++$+++ Jody, she's alive.
c26960 +++$+++ What?
c26960 +++$+++ Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
c26960 +++$+++ Then what was it?
c26960 +++$+++ Nothing.  It wasn't anything.  I've been on edge lately.  Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
c26960 +++$+++ Something was there.  You saw it.
c26960 +++$+++ Did I?
c26960 +++$+++ Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
c26960 +++$+++ Hartford?
c26960 +++$+++ And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
c26960 +++$+++ No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
c26960 +++$+++ Please.
c15051 +++$+++ Yeah.
c15051 +++$+++ This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
c15051 +++$+++ That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
c12371 +++$+++ I'm not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
c12371 +++$+++ You're a fag or a liar.
c12371 +++$+++ I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
c10049 +++$+++ Well? What are you waiting for?
c10049 +++$+++ I don't know what to say.
c10049 +++$+++ Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.  She's even more beautiful than I remember.
c13550 +++$+++ I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
c13550 +++$+++ Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
c13550 +++$+++ I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
c13550 +++$+++ Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
c13550 +++$+++ I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
c13550 +++$+++ A price on everything.
c13550 +++$+++ I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
c13550 +++$+++ I'm about ten blocks from the school.
c13550 +++$+++ I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
c13550 +++$+++ You're breaking up.  I can't hear you.  Theo?
c05594 +++$+++ I couldn't get it to go down.
c05594 +++$+++ And why was the alarm on?
c05594 +++$+++ Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
c05594 +++$+++ Oh God, we don't want the police!
c17147 +++$+++ Anthony, Daddy's busy.
c17147 +++$+++ This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
c17147 +++$+++ Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute.
c19719 +++$+++ THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
c19719 +++$+++ No.
c19719 +++$+++ No!
c10019 +++$+++ What?!
c10019 +++$+++ Harlan.
c10019 +++$+++ What?!  What about him?!
c10019 +++$+++ Now, Thelma, that is not...
c03650 +++$+++ Well, thank you. And thank them.
c03650 +++$+++ Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
c03650 +++$+++ That's true, Mr. Simms.
c03650 +++$+++ We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
c03650 +++$+++ Happy to see you looking so good.
c09656 +++$+++ Or would you rather I changed the subject?
c09656 +++$+++ I think so.
c09656 +++$+++ How do you like our little hamlet?
c09656 +++$+++ I despise it.
c09656 +++$+++ Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
c09656 +++$+++ Where are you from originally, Annie?
c09656 +++$+++ San Francisco.
c09656 +++$+++ Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
c20471 +++$+++ To my audition.
c20471 +++$+++ And who are we auditioning for today?
c20471 +++$+++ Wally Brown.
c20471 +++$+++ And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
c20471 +++$+++ No, we don't.
c20471 +++$+++ Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
c20471 +++$+++ Yes, Sir.
c20471 +++$+++ Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
c20471 +++$+++ Betty Elms.
c20471 +++$+++ Thank you... thank you very much.
c08041 +++$+++ You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
c08041 +++$+++ I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
c08041 +++$+++ No --
c08041 +++$+++ You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
c08041 +++$+++ But I never said Rudy.
c08041 +++$+++ I never told you my name.
c01181 +++$+++ Your life will never be the same.
c01181 +++$+++ Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
c01181 +++$+++ We both lied to him.
c01181 +++$+++ Just don't lie to me.
c06487 +++$+++ You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
c06487 +++$+++ They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
c06487 +++$+++ It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
c06487 +++$+++ That was <u>especially</u> Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be <u>us</u>. Home. Alone! <i></i> I have something I have to give you.
c06487 +++$+++ Yeah, I <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
c06994 +++$+++ Is this what you call the "butler"?
c06994 +++$+++ Yes.
c06994 +++$+++ Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
c06994 +++$+++ He takes good care of that.
c06994 +++$+++ He looks sad. Do you whip him?
c06994 +++$+++ The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.
c12030 +++$+++ I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
c12030 +++$+++ You name it, I paint there.
c12030 +++$+++ You want a drink?
c19280 +++$+++ Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
c19280 +++$+++ We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
c19280 +++$+++ Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
c19280 +++$+++ That's right.
c19280 +++$+++ I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
c19280 +++$+++ The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
c19280 +++$+++ Right.
c19280 +++$+++ I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
c19280 +++$+++ Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
c19280 +++$+++ A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
c20865 +++$+++ What is it?
c20865 +++$+++ ... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
c20865 +++$+++ Then, fuck you. I'm gone.
c12739 +++$+++ But I have a visitor.
c12739 +++$+++ Not today, George.  Time to go back.
c12739 +++$+++ But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
c12739 +++$+++ Okay, George.
c12739 +++$+++ We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
c02200 +++$+++ I don't know what kind of game you're playing here but I'm out because you are a whack-job.
c02200 +++$+++ He was working on something called Project Manticore, which was using recombinant DNA to produce a superior human...a warrior...an advanced infantry soldier.
c02200 +++$+++ The bar code on your neck, Max.  I know who you are and I know who you're running from.
c18792 +++$+++ Good luck with the fund raising.
c18792 +++$+++ It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
c18792 +++$+++ The last of my breed.
c21370 +++$+++ I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
c21370 +++$+++ That's real big of you.
c21370 +++$+++ You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
c24939 +++$+++ I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
c24939 +++$+++ If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
c24939 +++$+++ We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
c12575 +++$+++ We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
c12575 +++$+++ Domini.
c12575 +++$+++ --why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
c16574 +++$+++ Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
c16574 +++$+++ Your aunt?
c16574 +++$+++ Mrs. Smith.
c16574 +++$+++ Joan or Margaret Smith.
c16574 +++$+++ Right.
c16574 +++$+++ Well, which one?
c16574 +++$+++ Margaret.
c16574 +++$+++ Funny old bird.
c16574 +++$+++ Is she ever. I've got some stories....
c16574 +++$+++ I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
c16574 +++$+++ It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
c16574 +++$+++ Oh, he was dying for years.
c16574 +++$+++ Sure, but the end was so sudden.
c16574 +++$+++ He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
c16574 +++$+++ Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
c16574 +++$+++ Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
c16574 +++$+++ Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
c16574 +++$+++ Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
c13702 +++$+++ Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
c13702 +++$+++ Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
c13702 +++$+++ Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
c11018 +++$+++ Any luck raising Ackland's party?
c11018 +++$+++ Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
c11018 +++$+++ First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
c11018 +++$+++ Sure.  Do me good to stretch my legs.
c15047 +++$+++ Wanna try?
c15047 +++$+++ No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
c15047 +++$+++ No, sir.
c11519 +++$+++ How's everything at the apartment?
c11519 +++$+++ Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
c11519 +++$+++ I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
c11519 +++$+++ You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
c11519 +++$+++ I never thought he'd do it.
c11519 +++$+++ I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
c11519 +++$+++ I guess so.
c11519 +++$+++ For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
c11519 +++$+++ No, thank you.  I -- well, to tell you the truth --  -- I have this heavy date for tonight --
c11322 +++$+++ You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
c11322 +++$+++ David? You call your teacher David?
c11322 +++$+++ Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
c23046 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c23046 +++$+++ Do you understand me?
c23046 +++$+++ He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
c26733 +++$+++ Do you hear buzzing Fish?
c26733 +++$+++ Buzzing?
c26733 +++$+++ Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
c26733 +++$+++ I don't hear it.
c26733 +++$+++ Have another drink.
c07871 +++$+++ Whatcha doin'?
c07871 +++$+++ I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
c07871 +++$+++ Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
c07871 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c07871 +++$+++ Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
c07871 +++$+++ When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
c07871 +++$+++ Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
c07871 +++$+++ I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
c07871 +++$+++ Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
c07871 +++$+++ What did Tommy say?
c07871 +++$+++ Yeah, I know.
c06172 +++$+++ You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
c06172 +++$+++ Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
c06172 +++$+++ Everything happens once if you live long enough.
c06172 +++$+++ This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
c23736 +++$+++ What's that?
c23736 +++$+++ A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
c23736 +++$+++ That's why we need a safe passage. remember what you said earlier, about getting through the wall? That might just be our ticket.
c11292 +++$+++ I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
c11292 +++$+++ No, Chippewa Falls.
c11292 +++$+++ Right!  Where?
c11292 +++$+++ Wisconsin.
c11292 +++$+++ Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
c22567 +++$+++ Did you call that radio station again?
c22567 +++$+++ No.
c22567 +++$+++ Everyone at work heard you.
c22567 +++$+++ I just called for a second.
c22567 +++$+++ Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
c22567 +++$+++ It's a short word.
c22567 +++$+++ If she knew, she'd never forgive me.  It would be hopeless for the two of you.
c01488 +++$+++ How come you're not on the job?
c01488 +++$+++ I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
c01488 +++$+++ Not too good.
c03354 +++$+++ Great rehearsal.
c03354 +++$+++ You heard it?
c03354 +++$+++ You're the best one in your row.
c03354 +++$+++ Most people can't hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  You're good.
c03354 +++$+++ I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
c03354 +++$+++ I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
c03354 +++$+++ Who's the stiff?
c03354 +++$+++ Is he dying or something?
c23525 +++$+++ That's <u>why</u> the autopsy report identifies <u>drowning</u> as the cause of death.
c23525 +++$+++ Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
c23525 +++$+++ Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
c01326 +++$+++ It's bad.
c01326 +++$+++ It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
c01326 +++$+++ Probably tonight.
c04971 +++$+++ It's boring, isn't it?
c04971 +++$+++ I can sit through it once.
c04971 +++$+++ He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
c04971 +++$+++ He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am.
c14567 +++$+++ Algeria.
c14567 +++$+++ And you don't speak French?
c14567 +++$+++ -- Zero isn't interested in your life story.  Who gets killed?
c17470 +++$+++ How do you know?
c17470 +++$+++ I just know.
c17470 +++$+++ They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
c00014 +++$+++ Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
c00014 +++$+++ No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
c00014 +++$+++ What if she never starts dating?
c00014 +++$+++ But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
c23927 +++$+++ You can't walk me home.
c23927 +++$+++ Why not ?
c23927 +++$+++ I thought you were going to help Carl.
c23927 +++$+++ Johnny, my Dad's home today.
c07570 +++$+++ Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
c07570 +++$+++ I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
c07570 +++$+++ Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
c07570 +++$+++ Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
c07570 +++$+++ It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
c13227 +++$+++ No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
c13227 +++$+++ Well...
c13227 +++$+++ Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
c13227 +++$+++ I don't have another cat!
c13227 +++$+++ A parakeet?
c12640 +++$+++ Hold me, Don.
c12640 +++$+++ Don?. Where is he?
c12640 +++$+++ HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
c12640 +++$+++ Hold me. I'M FALLING!
c05105 +++$+++ Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
c05105 +++$+++ If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
c05105 +++$+++ See you then . . . doctor.
c20357 +++$+++ I don't want land.
c20357 +++$+++ Listen, Alice ...
c20357 +++$+++ Herbert.
c20357 +++$+++ Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
c20357 +++$+++ But I don't like her.
c20357 +++$+++ I know ... but ... I want the girl that I marry to  have ... a certain ... special ... something ...
c15846 +++$+++ I'm looking for someone.
c15846 +++$+++ Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
c15846 +++$+++ Yeah ...
c15846 +++$+++ Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
c15846 +++$+++ A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
c17780 +++$+++ S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning.
c17780 +++$+++ You nervous...?
c17780 +++$+++ Gonna be fine.  You ask your momma.
c02145 +++$+++ You can start Monday week.
c02145 +++$+++ Fine.
c02145 +++$+++ Fine.
c12414 +++$+++ Well, if you want my opinion...
c12414 +++$+++ I don't. I have my own.
c12414 +++$+++ You grown.
c12414 +++$+++ Yes sir
c12414 +++$+++ Thank you.
c16056 +++$+++ I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
c16056 +++$+++ No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
c16056 +++$+++ What I mean is --
c16056 +++$+++ So work with me, not against me. Okay?
c24833 +++$+++ Watts?
c24833 +++$+++ What's his first name?
c24833 +++$+++ David?  David Watts?  Can you hear us?  David!  Daviiiiid!
c15570 +++$+++ Pacific Coast Bell.
c15570 +++$+++ This is Sgt. Vincennes. Requesting a name and address on a phone number.  Hollywood zero-one- two-three-nine.
c15570 +++$+++ Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
c15570 +++$+++ I just called it.
c15570 +++$+++ A bootleg...
c15940 +++$+++ Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
c15940 +++$+++ No. Not at all,
c15940 +++$+++ You were expecting a deliver y that day?
c15940 +++$+++ Not that I know of.
c15940 +++$+++ Groceries maybe? A package?
c15940 +++$+++ I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
c15940 +++$+++ Oh, I see.
c15940 +++$+++ Never mind.
c19050 +++$+++ I want to go down there.
c19050 +++$+++ You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
c19050 +++$+++ I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.
c19050 +++$+++ You cannot.
c19050 +++$+++ I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
c19050 +++$+++ But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.
c19050 +++$+++ I would not know. Maybe.
c18633 +++$+++ Ahhh, ahhh...
c18633 +++$+++ Now what?
c18633 +++$+++ Gotta sneeze.
c18633 +++$+++ Can't help it... ahh...
c08461 +++$+++ ...Tell Morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
c08461 +++$+++ ...I will.
c08461 +++$+++ ...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
c08461 +++$+++ ...I will.
c08461 +++$+++ ...Tell Graham --
c08461 +++$+++ Tell him... See. Tell him to see.
c00472 +++$+++ For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
c00472 +++$+++ Simon.
c00472 +++$+++ And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
c17581 +++$+++ Excuse me.
c17581 +++$+++ Yo, chill man, I'm talking to Venezuela.
c17581 +++$+++ Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
c26295 +++$+++ You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.
c26295 +++$+++ Like you.
c26295 +++$+++ Beautiful?
c26295 +++$+++ Like they're made of polyester.
c26295 +++$+++ Nothing like a little liveliness.
c19409 +++$+++ I guess she's busy.
c19409 +++$+++ That's ok.
c19409 +++$+++ When are you coming home?
c19409 +++$+++ Tomorrow.
c19409 +++$+++ Ok.
c06956 +++$+++ You okay?
c06956 +++$+++ Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
c06956 +++$+++ Okay.
c23206 +++$+++ Was it me, did you have something against me?
c23206 +++$+++ What, do you think I planned it?
c23206 +++$+++ Did they have something against me?
c23206 +++$+++ Didn't they tell you?
c23206 +++$+++ ... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
c14886 +++$+++ Hi.
c14886 +++$+++ Hi.
c14886 +++$+++ It's nice.
c12612 +++$+++ Are you Detective Williams?
c12612 +++$+++ Yes.
c12612 +++$+++ My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
c12612 +++$+++ Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
c12612 +++$+++ He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
c12612 +++$+++ You did? A human ear?
c12612 +++$+++ Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
c14501 +++$+++ What is it? Are you OK?
c14501 +++$+++ Always the drugs.
c14501 +++$+++ What?
c14501 +++$+++ We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
c16612 +++$+++ A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
c16612 +++$+++ Yeah.
c16612 +++$+++ Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding.
c25138 +++$+++ You wouldn't announce it?
c25138 +++$+++ I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
c25138 +++$+++ Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time...
c11216 +++$+++ Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
c11216 +++$+++ It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
c11216 +++$+++ Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
c11216 +++$+++ Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a story.  Stifler finds this beer, right?  And...
c05586 +++$+++ Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
c05586 +++$+++ A faerie's love makes anything possible.
c05586 +++$+++ What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
c22481 +++$+++ It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
c22481 +++$+++ Highly suspect.
c22481 +++$+++ Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
c04176 +++$+++ Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
c04176 +++$+++ Yes. Where is he?
c04176 +++$+++ I know. Where is he, I said.
c16580 +++$+++ Refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.
c16580 +++$+++ What about breaking and entering?  Are you wearing anything under that?
c16580 +++$+++ I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
c24893 +++$+++ Hi, Mr Crane.
c24893 +++$+++ Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
c24893 +++$+++ Hello, Tony.
c24119 +++$+++ Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
c24119 +++$+++ Does Jackie know this?
c24119 +++$+++ No.  I'm doing it behind her back.
c24119 +++$+++ In seven years Jackie's never missed one of Tucker's parties. Where is she?
c24119 +++$+++ Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
c18448 +++$+++ Say yes.
c18448 +++$+++ No.
c18448 +++$+++ Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
c07549 +++$+++ What?  I'm not going anywhere!
c07549 +++$+++ Oh yes you are!
c07549 +++$+++ That's right.
c13383 +++$+++ I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
c13383 +++$+++ I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
c13383 +++$+++ I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
c13383 +++$+++ Well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know?  But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the, uh, that's the main thing here. You want your kid, don't you? Huh?
c00360 +++$+++ You better take Powell and Carney with you --
c00360 +++$+++ The frogmen?
c00360 +++$+++ With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
c00360 +++$+++ We hope!
c03080 +++$+++ Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
c03080 +++$+++ It's what he said, I'm his associate.
c03080 +++$+++ That's right, me.
c17899 +++$+++ Sure plenty of times.
c17899 +++$+++ Well?
c17899 +++$+++ Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange.
c17899 +++$+++ Did I ever talk about the accident?
c17899 +++$+++ No.
c17899 +++$+++ Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
c17899 +++$+++ What was it?
c05067 +++$+++ None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
c05067 +++$+++ A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
c05067 +++$+++ But there was an attack. I can still see them coming. There was a fight, wasn't there?
c05067 +++$+++ Who then?
c15107 +++$+++ Fox hunting -- a Stone going fox hunting on a week day -- and the earth crying out for the touch of him!
c15107 +++$+++ Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
c15107 +++$+++ Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
c15107 +++$+++ Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
c15107 +++$+++ I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
c01658 +++$+++ Everything okay?
c01658 +++$+++ Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
c01658 +++$+++ No.
c17236 +++$+++ I'm not interested --
c17236 +++$+++ I knew you'd say that.
c17236 +++$+++ I knew you'd say that, too --
c18666 +++$+++ I'll nick the boss' plane again....
c18666 +++$+++ What?
c18666 +++$+++ I borrow it without telling him....
c18666 +++$+++ Won't you get in trouble...?
c18666 +++$+++ Only if he finds out... It's a short hop to the Caribbean.  We could take a few days....
c18666 +++$+++ There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....
c06974 +++$+++ We don't want to be disturbed.
c06974 +++$+++ My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
c06974 +++$+++ If you want to see us you must come later.
c06974 +++$+++ But you can't...
c00131 +++$+++ What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
c00131 +++$+++ Two weeks holiday.
c00131 +++$+++ How much money are you carrying with you?
c00131 +++$+++ Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
c21461 +++$+++ It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
c21461 +++$+++ I might.
c21461 +++$+++ Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
c10418 +++$+++ Thank you...
c10418 +++$+++ ...that's perfectly all right.
c10418 +++$+++ To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
c11608 +++$+++ Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
c11608 +++$+++ Do you know that jungle?
c11608 +++$+++ What about an American named Kurtz?
c18554 +++$+++ There is nothing to discuss.
c18554 +++$+++ Will you listen to this man? Will you just listen to him?  You really caused a panic on a public beach, you shoot up the place, God knows who could've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us?  That could ruin us.
c18554 +++$+++ Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
c18554 +++$+++ You don't make enough.
c18554 +++$+++ Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
c18554 +++$+++ It means I don't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife, it means I know who's out to screw me here, and it means that I know something none of you know because I've been there -- and I don't want to go through that horror again.  Ever!
c26318 +++$+++ You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
c26318 +++$+++ I do.
c26318 +++$+++ You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
c26318 +++$+++ I did?
c26318 +++$+++ Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
c26318 +++$+++ I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
c26318 +++$+++ I'm not rambling.
c26318 +++$+++ You're talking like a mad man.
c26318 +++$+++ You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
c26318 +++$+++ That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
c26318 +++$+++ Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
c26318 +++$+++ A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
c26318 +++$+++ You meant it.
c26318 +++$+++ What makes you say that?
c26318 +++$+++ Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
c26318 +++$+++ The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.
c06256 +++$+++ What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
c06256 +++$+++ Waddaya talking about?!!
c06256 +++$+++ Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
c06256 +++$+++ I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
c06256 +++$+++ She don't wanna use my pots and pans!
c25441 +++$+++ You're late.  Where you been?
c25441 +++$+++ I had some appointments.
c25441 +++$+++ How much did ya lose?
c25441 +++$+++ All of it.
c25441 +++$+++ In one goddamn night?  What are ya sprayin' money around like that for? You coulda been nailed.
c25441 +++$+++ I checked the place out.  There weren't no dicks in there.
c25441 +++$+++ You're a con man, and you blew it like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to be no pimp.
c25441 +++$+++ What's eatin' you?  I've blown money before.
c25441 +++$+++ No class grifter woulda' done it, that's all.
c25441 +++$+++ I think it's the best...
c09716 +++$+++ The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
c09716 +++$+++ What were the crows after at the school?
c09716 +++$+++ What do you think they were after, Miss...?
c09716 +++$+++ Daniels. I think they were after the children.
c09716 +++$+++ To...  To kill them.
c26263 +++$+++ The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
c26263 +++$+++ Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
c26263 +++$+++ You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
c26263 +++$+++ Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
c26263 +++$+++ You afraid of the dark?
c26263 +++$+++ Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
c26263 +++$+++ You don't fear death?
c26263 +++$+++ We was born to die, boy.  From the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  You just don't know where, or when, or how.  Don't make sense worryin' about the particulars.
c26263 +++$+++ We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
c26263 +++$+++ More or less.
c26263 +++$+++ Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
c26263 +++$+++ We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
c26263 +++$+++ Same back at you.
c20767 +++$+++ Yeah, we met. They're good men.
c20767 +++$+++ They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
c20767 +++$+++ Waitin' in the lounge.
c20767 +++$+++ Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
c10902 +++$+++ ???
c10902 +++$+++ ???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
c10902 +++$+++ I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud.
c10902 +++$+++ Then help her.
c10902 +++$+++ I am...
c10902 +++$+++ No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
c10902 +++$+++ What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
c10902 +++$+++ There's another choice.
c10902 +++$+++ What?
c10902 +++$+++ Aquittal.
c10902 +++$+++ Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
c23038 +++$+++ A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
c23038 +++$+++ I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
c23038 +++$+++ It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
c23038 +++$+++ If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
c00521 +++$+++ Newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.
c00521 +++$+++ How the hell do you know that?
c00521 +++$+++ A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
c00521 +++$+++ So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
c00521 +++$+++ Why the hell--?!  Great, fine.  You talk to the wife.
c07746 +++$+++ This is Barry.
c07746 +++$+++ What are you doing?
c07746 +++$+++ Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
c07746 +++$+++ Are you going to the party tonight?
c07746 +++$+++ Yes I am.
c07746 +++$+++ What are you doing?
c07746 +++$+++ Nothing.
c07746 +++$+++ Right now, you're doing nothing?
c07746 +++$+++ I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
c07746 +++$+++ What time are you gonna be there?
c07746 +++$+++ Seven o'clock.
c07746 +++$+++ You can't be late.
c07746 +++$+++ I won't.
c07746 +++$+++ I'm serious.
c07746 +++$+++ I know.
c07746 +++$+++ Seriously.
c07746 +++$+++ Ok.
c07746 +++$+++ You can't be late though.
c07746 +++$+++ I know.
c07746 +++$+++ You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
c07746 +++$+++ I know.
c07746 +++$+++ Seriously.
c07746 +++$+++ I know.
c07746 +++$+++ You can't just stay in your house.
c07746 +++$+++ I know.
c07746 +++$+++ Yeah but I'm serious.
c07746 +++$+++ Ok.
c07746 +++$+++ I'll see you there.
c07746 +++$+++ I'll see you there.
c07746 +++$+++ I won't.
c18999 +++$+++ He looks like a terrific kid.
c18999 +++$+++ He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
c18999 +++$+++ Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
c18999 +++$+++ You've been living here, in the city?
c18999 +++$+++ Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
c18999 +++$+++ You want what?!
c18999 +++$+++ I want my son.  I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
c18999 +++$+++ Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember?
c18999 +++$+++ Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage--  Look, don't get so defensive, okay?  It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
c18999 +++$+++ Joanna, I don't give a--
c18999 +++$+++ Such as?
c12811 +++$+++ Do you think I did it?
c12811 +++$+++ I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
c12811 +++$+++ Not a very good one I'm afraid.
c01504 +++$+++ I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
c01504 +++$+++ How do you do?
c01504 +++$+++ Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
c01504 +++$+++ Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
c13159 +++$+++ Ready.
c13159 +++$+++ Your hair's a little funny.
c13159 +++$+++ It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
c13159 +++$+++ No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's do this.
c25383 +++$+++ So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
c25383 +++$+++ Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
c25383 +++$+++ Sorry Jeanne...  Did you both meet already?
c08347 +++$+++ Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
c08347 +++$+++ You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
c08347 +++$+++ I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
c08347 +++$+++ Well, at least you still talk the same.
c08347 +++$+++ So who changes?
c08347 +++$+++ That was my father's idea... private practice. He wanted to set me up -- I couldn't say no. But he's dead now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I gotta do research. Look at that beautiful stuff...  ...lookit it!
c24499 +++$+++ Lex...Lex, how could you do that to Otis?
c24499 +++$+++ What else is ballast for?
c24499 +++$+++ How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
c24499 +++$+++ There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
c24499 +++$+++ You'll have to pack quickly.
c24499 +++$+++ A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
c24499 +++$+++ A parka.
c24499 +++$+++ North!
c17983 +++$+++ Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
c17983 +++$+++ No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
c17983 +++$+++ That's okay, Mom.
c21002 +++$+++ By the way -- it's you.
c21002 +++$+++ Me?
c21002 +++$+++ Well, yes.  Groovy.
c21024 +++$+++ What's going on?
c21024 +++$+++ I'm going to throw out these old videos.
c21024 +++$+++ No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
c21024 +++$+++ Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
c05750 +++$+++ Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
c05750 +++$+++ That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
c05750 +++$+++ What do you mean, "possessed?"
c05750 +++$+++ Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
c05750 +++$+++ Yes...
c05750 +++$+++ Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
c05750 +++$+++ ...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
c18879 +++$+++ You look like brothers.
c18879 +++$+++ Yes -- we do.
c18879 +++$+++ No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
c03492 +++$+++ Don't talk about Elaine.
c03492 +++$+++ Don't talk about Elaine?
c03492 +++$+++ No.
c03492 +++$+++ Because I don't want you to.
c08918 +++$+++ This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
c08918 +++$+++ Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
c08918 +++$+++ Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
c08918 +++$+++ Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
c08918 +++$+++ It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
c08918 +++$+++ ... Fascinating.
c08918 +++$+++ All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
c08918 +++$+++ It's a little early to celebrate.
c06394 +++$+++ What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
c06394 +++$+++ Your concern is heartwarming.
c06394 +++$+++ It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
c06394 +++$+++ His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
c24563 +++$+++ It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
c24563 +++$+++ Maybe I should get help.
c24563 +++$+++ It wouldn't hurt. You can't go on living in fantasies. Did you really think you could get hold of a nuclear bomb? And drop it?  Why, our Strategic Defense boys would have  --
c24563 +++$+++ You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
c24563 +++$+++ I know. I know.  I never promised myself a rose garden.
c00609 +++$+++ Yes?
c00609 +++$+++ Are you Herr Mozart?
c00609 +++$+++ That's right.
c00609 +++$+++ My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
c00609 +++$+++ They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
c18546 +++$+++ Chief?
c18546 +++$+++ In here.
c18546 +++$+++ I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
c18546 +++$+++ You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
c18546 +++$+++ Positive I.D.?
c18546 +++$+++ Oh.
c10464 +++$+++ We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
c10464 +++$+++ We'd be in all the papers!
c10464 +++$+++ We could show 'em we're friendly, huh?  Walk out there with a white flag!  Here - I got an old sugar sack in my car!
c07457 +++$+++ Is he really all right?
c07457 +++$+++ Yes.
c07457 +++$+++ I know.
c18799 +++$+++ How did you know?
c18799 +++$+++ That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
c18799 +++$+++ Last time I plugged it in, I suppose. Why?
c18979 +++$+++ Salisbury steak.
c18979 +++$+++ I hate it.
c18979 +++$+++ You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
c18979 +++$+++ No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
c18979 +++$+++ All it is is onions and gravy.
c18979 +++$+++ You are not allergic of onions.
c09598 +++$+++ I'll go.
c09598 +++$+++ Wrong.
c09598 +++$+++ I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
c08126 +++$+++ Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
c08126 +++$+++ Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
c08126 +++$+++ His letters will keep.
c04389 +++$+++ You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
c04389 +++$+++ I used to be an actress.
c04389 +++$+++ Yeah? What do you do now?
c04389 +++$+++ I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
c04389 +++$+++ You don't look like a college girl.
c04389 +++$+++ I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
c04389 +++$+++ No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
c04389 +++$+++ I'm not.
c04389 +++$+++ So why go to college?
c04389 +++$+++ I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
c04389 +++$+++ What do you do on the other days?
c04389 +++$+++ I drink.
c04389 +++$+++ Hey!
c04389 +++$+++ No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
c04389 +++$+++ Eddie. The name is Eddie.
c04389 +++$+++ The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
c04389 +++$+++ I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
c04389 +++$+++ I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
c04389 +++$+++ I could always get us a bottle.
c04389 +++$+++ No.
c04389 +++$+++ Fifth of scotch?
c04389 +++$+++ No. I'll take you home.
c11572 +++$+++ Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
c11572 +++$+++ Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
c11572 +++$+++ A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
c11572 +++$+++ You'll miss your train, Jeff.
c04893 +++$+++ Hello.  Is this Jim Garrison's daughter?
c04893 +++$+++ Yes?
c04893 +++$+++ Virginia or Elizabeth?
c04893 +++$+++ Virginia.
c04893 +++$+++ Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
c04893 +++$+++ That sounds fun.
c04893 +++$+++ I need some information from you then.  How old are you?
c04893 +++$+++ And how tall are you?
c27104 +++$+++ I have to be honest with you, Ted. I really despise "The Girls of Xenia."
c27104 +++$+++ I know, their small town mentality can be maddening.
c27104 +++$+++ Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
c21562 +++$+++ Dine and dance tonight? I've got fifty bucks to throw away.
c21562 +++$+++ Not tonight.
c21562 +++$+++ What's the matter?
c21562 +++$+++ I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
c21562 +++$+++ We have some nice places around Vancouver.
c21562 +++$+++ I'm sure you have.
c21562 +++$+++ Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
c21562 +++$+++ I haven't been invited.
c21562 +++$+++ Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
c21562 +++$+++ Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
c24387 +++$+++ What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
c24387 +++$+++ I ran into some people I knew.
c24387 +++$+++ Where are your...?
c03750 +++$+++ I feel the same way.  What next?
c03750 +++$+++ What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
c03750 +++$+++ None.
c03750 +++$+++ Good night.
c05237 +++$+++ But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
c05237 +++$+++ Yep.
c05237 +++$+++ Yeah me too nigga.
c25137 +++$+++ That would be a catastrophic mistake.
c25137 +++$+++ People hate Jews. Do you agree?
c25137 +++$+++ No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl.  It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.
c02955 +++$+++ One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts.
c02955 +++$+++ They had to kill 'em?
c02955 +++$+++ Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
c02955 +++$+++ That's a good story.
c02955 +++$+++ So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
c02955 +++$+++ He was married?
c02955 +++$+++ At first.
c02955 +++$+++ Not me.  You?
c11717 +++$+++ Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?
c11717 +++$+++ What?
c11717 +++$+++ You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
c11717 +++$+++ What I just said, no assassin would say.  What I've said, only a mark would say.
c00886 +++$+++ I'm so hungry.
c00886 +++$+++ It's cold out, too, isn't it?
c00886 +++$+++ I'm so hungry.
c00886 +++$+++ Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
c00886 +++$+++ Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
c02204 +++$+++ These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
c02204 +++$+++ And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
c02204 +++$+++ You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
c02204 +++$+++ We're quoting Mom again.
c02204 +++$+++ Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
c02204 +++$+++ And you still think you can do something to change that.
c02204 +++$+++ With your help.
c02204 +++$+++ And whether you want to believe it or not, you already fired the first shot.  On another matter, Federal Corrections used to keep records on distinguishing marks-- scars, tattoos.  I did a search and came up with this.
c12547 +++$+++ Baby names?
c12547 +++$+++ I don't know. Nightmare.
c12547 +++$+++ Yes.
c03173 +++$+++ What do you think happened on this boat?
c03173 +++$+++ I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
c03173 +++$+++ The what?
c03173 +++$+++ Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
c03173 +++$+++ I don't know, are we?
c23374 +++$+++ Returning to the Western Woods?
c23374 +++$+++ Yes, actually.
c23374 +++$+++ Use caution.
c23374 +++$+++ As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo.  Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
c10665 +++$+++ You cold, James?
c10665 +++$+++ A little.
c10665 +++$+++ So what are you doing out here?
c10665 +++$+++ You're right.
c19024 +++$+++ She ever ask about me?
c19024 +++$+++ Uh, huh...Yeah...
c19024 +++$+++ I told her you're doing a
c04097 +++$+++ Good way to lose your job.
c04097 +++$+++ Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
c04097 +++$+++ I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
c04097 +++$+++ You always were hard to impress.
c12028 +++$+++ Piss painting?
c12028 +++$+++ I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
c12028 +++$+++ I don't like beer.
c18037 +++$+++ Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
c18037 +++$+++ Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
c18037 +++$+++ Then we shouldn't break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  This could be a very important find.  I want it documented.
c17189 +++$+++ Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread.
c17189 +++$+++ Sounds like something you feed the dog.
c17189 +++$+++ It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
c17189 +++$+++ Of course not.  As I said, only poor people --
c03613 +++$+++ Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.
c03613 +++$+++ Thanks, uh, Lilly.
c03613 +++$+++ Don't mention it.
c03613 +++$+++ You always did.
c13101 +++$+++ It's my first cigarette in over a year.
c13101 +++$+++ The first is always the best.
c13101 +++$+++ It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
c13101 +++$+++ You never know.
c13101 +++$+++ I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
c13101 +++$+++ At least he's got people around him.
c13101 +++$+++ I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
c13101 +++$+++ Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
c13101 +++$+++ Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
c13101 +++$+++ That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
c16828 +++$+++ And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
c16828 +++$+++ I have a class. I'm late.
c16828 +++$+++ I'm not sure.
c16044 +++$+++ Go ahead.
c16044 +++$+++ No.
c16044 +++$+++ Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
c16044 +++$+++ Oh, yeah, right.  I forgot.
c09821 +++$+++ We still going?
c09821 +++$+++ Honda 250, huh?
c09821 +++$+++ That's right.
c09821 +++$+++ Star?...
c19801 +++$+++ I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
c19801 +++$+++ Really?
c19801 +++$+++ You bet your ass.  It keeps him going.  Maybe it keeps all of us going.
c19801 +++$+++ How many were there?
c19801 +++$+++ Five.  Since I've been here.
c19801 +++$+++ What happened to them?
c19801 +++$+++ Dead.  All dead.
c19801 +++$+++ Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.
c17430 +++$+++ You take this.  I ain't hungry.
c17430 +++$+++ Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
c17430 +++$+++ I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
c17430 +++$+++ You take that plate inside the tent an' you eat it.
c17430 +++$+++ You git. Go on now, git. You ain't doin' no good. They ain't enough for you.
c17900 +++$+++ Sorry.
c17900 +++$+++ If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients.
c17900 +++$+++ I understand... I won't-
c17900 +++$+++ No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
c17900 +++$+++ Just get better okay?
c01932 +++$+++ Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
c01932 +++$+++ I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
c01932 +++$+++ I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
c01932 +++$+++ My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
c01932 +++$+++ There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
c01932 +++$+++ There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
c01932 +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
c01932 +++$+++ My wife?
c07695 +++$+++ It's not cool?
c07695 +++$+++ It's fine, but --
c07695 +++$+++ -- do you think you'll ask her out?
c07695 +++$+++ I feel really on the spot now.
c07695 +++$+++ Are you gonna do it?
c07695 +++$+++ I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
c07695 +++$+++ You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
c07695 +++$+++ I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
c07695 +++$+++ I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
c07695 +++$+++ I don't know.
c07695 +++$+++ I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
c07695 +++$+++ What?
c07695 +++$+++ Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
c07695 +++$+++ You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.
c09410 +++$+++ She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
c09410 +++$+++ You didn't have to get into it, baby.
c09410 +++$+++ Sorry about interrupting...
c09410 +++$+++ Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
c09410 +++$+++ Christy was nice...
c09410 +++$+++ I didn't even like her, to be honest.
c09410 +++$+++ She was hot.
c09410 +++$+++ She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
c09410 +++$+++ I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
c09410 +++$+++ No, baby. You're money.
c09410 +++$+++ She didn't like me, anyway.
c09410 +++$+++ She thought you were money.
c09410 +++$+++ I don't think so.
c09410 +++$+++ I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
c09410 +++$+++ Yeah, a good friend.
c09410 +++$+++ Baby, you take yourself out of the game. You start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.
c09410 +++$+++ I just don't think she liked me in that way.
c09410 +++$+++ Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
c09410 +++$+++ Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
c09410 +++$+++ Michelle went for you, right.
c09410 +++$+++ That was different.
c09410 +++$+++ How?
c09410 +++$+++ I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
c09410 +++$+++ That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
c09410 +++$+++ I just need some time...
c09410 +++$+++ Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
c09410 +++$+++ Don't remind me.
c09410 +++$+++ You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
c09410 +++$+++ ...a day...
c09410 +++$+++ ...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
c09410 +++$+++ Selling scrap metal.
c09410 +++$+++ See? And what does this guy she's with do?
c09410 +++$+++ He drives a carriage.
c09410 +++$+++ What?!?
c09410 +++$+++ I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
c09410 +++$+++ Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
c09410 +++$+++ Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
c11573 +++$+++ Coming?
c11573 +++$+++ You run along -- I want to fix my face.
c11573 +++$+++ Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
c11573 +++$+++ It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
c09444 +++$+++ You had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight.
c09444 +++$+++ This one could seduce the devil.  A body! and eyes as big and black as olives.
c09444 +++$+++ I know about what you mean!
c09444 +++$+++ This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
c09444 +++$+++ And hair.  Black and curly, like a doll.  And such a mouth.
c05676 +++$+++ Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
c05676 +++$+++ Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
c05676 +++$+++ Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
c05676 +++$+++ A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real nice. You won't have to work long. I'll be back soon enough. After I start work at First Federal Bank of Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in style. Everything will get back to normal again. That's a promise.
c05830 +++$+++ What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
c05830 +++$+++ No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
c05830 +++$+++ Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that.
c05830 +++$+++ No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
c05830 +++$+++ I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!!
c05830 +++$+++ Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
c05830 +++$+++ I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
c05830 +++$+++ It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
c27425 +++$+++ Aye-gor!
c27425 +++$+++ Fro-derick!
c27425 +++$+++ I got frightened all alone upstairs, so I came down here.
c18585 +++$+++ Go on, Doctor.
c18585 +++$+++ No one's ever caught a Great White except indirectly in fishing nets. I want to dart it and keep it alive.
c18585 +++$+++ I can get it.
c13931 +++$+++ Okay, give me the keys.
c13931 +++$+++ You bastard.
c13931 +++$+++ It's either that or you drive to the police yourself.
c13931 +++$+++ The police?
c13931 +++$+++ C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
c13931 +++$+++ She's not tied up!
c13931 +++$+++ You know what I mean. You're keeping her there against her will.
c13931 +++$+++ Then let's go talk to her.
c12418 +++$+++ Back stiff?
c12418 +++$+++ OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
c12418 +++$+++ That was fun.
c25489 +++$+++ Will you wait until the chump is played?
c25489 +++$+++ Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
c25489 +++$+++ I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
c25489 +++$+++ Just as long as I get to finish the play.
c08406 +++$+++ I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
c08406 +++$+++ Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
c08406 +++$+++ Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
c08406 +++$+++ No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
c23601 +++$+++ Anything this time?
c23601 +++$+++ I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
c23601 +++$+++ Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
c04583 +++$+++ I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
c04583 +++$+++ It's not apparent.
c04583 +++$+++ ...and sort of...disinterest.
c04583 +++$+++ Disinterest?
c04583 +++$+++ As if your mind's not all there.
c04583 +++$+++ I am sort of scattered.
c04583 +++$+++ Can I help?
c04583 +++$+++ Are you alright?
c20124 +++$+++ He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
c20124 +++$+++ Manny...
c20124 +++$+++ We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
c01397 +++$+++ Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
c01397 +++$+++ How long... how long I been out?
c01397 +++$+++ You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
c01397 +++$+++ After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.
c12126 +++$+++ What now sir?
c12126 +++$+++ Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
c12126 +++$+++ Tonight's a good night.
c08343 +++$+++ Where is he now? Do you know?
c08343 +++$+++ I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
c08343 +++$+++ Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
c20878 +++$+++ Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
c20878 +++$+++ I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
c20878 +++$+++ Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
c01081 +++$+++ Why'd you come here, Brian?
c01081 +++$+++ I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
c01081 +++$+++ What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
c01081 +++$+++ Hey! You don't know me --
c01081 +++$+++ I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
c01081 +++$+++ Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
c11142 +++$+++ --I want you to shut up and listen to me--
c11142 +++$+++ --I haven't said anything--
c11142 +++$+++ --for the first time I'm beginning to feel like a fucking reporter-- Woodward, I got a tip. A guy called me up with a tip--  --someone named Donald Segretti contacted a bunch of lawyers and asked them if they'd like to go to work with him screwing up the Democrats, dirty tricks, shit like that. The FBI knows about Segretti-- Howard Hunt made a bunch of phone calls to him--they interrogated him, but on account of Segretti wasn't involved with the break-in, they didn't follow through. But Segretti did a lot of traveling--he called these lawyers from different places, and he told them the Republicans knew what he was doing.
c11142 +++$+++ How high up, which Republicans?
c11142 +++$+++ That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
c11142 +++$+++ --Haldeman I know, who else?
c11142 +++$+++ Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
c11142 +++$+++ The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
c11142 +++$+++ Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
c11142 +++$+++ So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
c11142 +++$+++ If he self-destructed.
c13939 +++$+++ Sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
c13939 +++$+++ But, Mr. Gittes.
c13939 +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Gittes.
c20462 +++$+++ What's wrong?
c20462 +++$+++ I don't know who I am.
c20462 +++$+++ I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
c15652 +++$+++ Jones had to flee the scene before we could locate the second body.
c15652 +++$+++ What about the tape?
c15652 +++$+++ And if it wasn't?
c08593 +++$+++ Did you think the play sucked big time?
c08593 +++$+++ What?
c08593 +++$+++ Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He said the play sucked big time.
c08593 +++$+++ I know every child is special in their own way, but Tommy sounds like a punk.  I thought the play was excellent. Better than Cats.
c08593 +++$+++ Never mind.
c15717 +++$+++ It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
c15717 +++$+++ The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
c15717 +++$+++ What do I do?
c15717 +++$+++ There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance.  I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
c15717 +++$+++ So I follow the wires?
c15717 +++$+++ I follow the wires.
c09768 +++$+++ You want me to walk a straight line?
c09768 +++$+++ I want you... to bend over.
c09768 +++$+++ What did I say?
c24175 +++$+++ Where are you trying to reach him?
c24175 +++$+++ At his office in the Capitol.
c24175 +++$+++ Did you get that, Kulnick?
c25537 +++$+++ Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
c25537 +++$+++ Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
c25537 +++$+++ She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
c25537 +++$+++ I haven't been a detective for four years.
c25537 +++$+++ You don't say --
c25537 +++$+++ My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
c25537 +++$+++ I see.  I see.
c25537 +++$+++ What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
c25537 +++$+++ You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
c25537 +++$+++ He sends word through Julia Wolf when he wants money...  I give it to her and she gives it to him.
c05269 +++$+++ Yep. That's the best way. It's that boom boom boom.
c05269 +++$+++ Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
c05269 +++$+++ Yep.
c05269 +++$+++ Sweet.
c14122 +++$+++ Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital.
c14122 +++$+++ I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure.
c14122 +++$+++ A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
c13940 +++$+++ Where'd he go yesterday?
c13940 +++$+++ Three reservoirs. Men's room of a Richfield gas station on Flower, and the Pig 'n Whistle.
c13940 +++$+++ Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
c13940 +++$+++ What'd you expect? That's his job.
c13940 +++$+++ Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
c13940 +++$+++ I think I got something.
c13940 +++$+++ It's on your desk. Say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the North Pole with Admiral Byrd looking for penguins?
c00278 +++$+++ What do you want?
c00278 +++$+++ I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
c00278 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c00278 +++$+++ The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
c00278 +++$+++ Bullshit.
c00278 +++$+++ I'm telling you...
c00278 +++$+++ Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
c00278 +++$+++ Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
c00278 +++$+++ There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
c00278 +++$+++ Nobody knows anything.
c16902 +++$+++ Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
c16902 +++$+++ I was at home.
c16902 +++$+++ Were <i>you</i> alone?
c16902 +++$+++ Yes.
c16902 +++$+++ So we don't know for sure about you, either.
c16902 +++$+++ No.
c16902 +++$+++ Why don't we say we were together?
c16902 +++$+++ I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
c03234 +++$+++ Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
c03234 +++$+++ It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
c03234 +++$+++ I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
c03234 +++$+++ Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
c03234 +++$+++ What? When did you see Josh?!
c03234 +++$+++ He came into work.
c03234 +++$+++ Why? What did he say?
c03234 +++$+++ Nothing.
c03234 +++$+++ I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
c16377 +++$+++ If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.
c16377 +++$+++ Okay.
c16377 +++$+++ Promise you won't.
c16377 +++$+++ Yes, I promise.
c16377 +++$+++ Promise?
c16377 +++$+++ That was three times you promised.
c09062 +++$+++ Full impulse.
c09062 +++$+++ The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
c09062 +++$+++ I'll be in Engineering.
c01624 +++$+++ Frank gone?
c01624 +++$+++ Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
c01624 +++$+++ Bull.
c01624 +++$+++ Alright, suit yourself.
c01624 +++$+++ He's comin' back? What for?
c01624 +++$+++ 'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
c01624 +++$+++ Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
c01624 +++$+++ Oh he forced you, huh?
c01624 +++$+++ He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
c01624 +++$+++ Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.
c01039 +++$+++ Nice shot.
c01039 +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
c01039 +++$+++ I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
c01039 +++$+++ Yes, sir, I am.
c01039 +++$+++ Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
c01039 +++$+++ I've tried to change her mind.
c01039 +++$+++ It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
c01039 +++$+++ If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.
c10619 +++$+++ Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
c10619 +++$+++ What could I be up to, Lula?
c10619 +++$+++ He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
c10619 +++$+++ I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
c10619 +++$+++ That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
c10619 +++$+++ That was in Vietnam.
c10619 +++$+++ He's the kind liked it.
c10619 +++$+++ Lula, I got to get some sleep.
c10619 +++$+++ Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
c10619 +++$+++ What?
c10619 +++$+++ Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
c00934 +++$+++ ...You got my E-mail?
c00934 +++$+++ And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
c00934 +++$+++ Uh. Not exactly.
c14091 +++$+++ I didn't think they even enforced this.
c14091 +++$+++ Living proof.
c14091 +++$+++ I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
c14091 +++$+++ I don't; you did.
c14091 +++$+++ Really?
c14091 +++$+++ Little girl. Maybe five years old?
c14091 +++$+++ Holy shit. That girl?
c14091 +++$+++ As opposed to the hundreds of other children you let buy cigarettes whenever you work here.
c14091 +++$+++ Then how come you got the fine?
c14091 +++$+++ Because I'm here.
c14091 +++$+++ You're lying.
c14091 +++$+++ I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
c14091 +++$+++ Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
c14091 +++$+++ Because I'm happy.
c14091 +++$+++ You're happy?
c14091 +++$+++ I'm happy.
c14091 +++$+++ You're happy to get a fine?
c14091 +++$+++ No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
c14091 +++$+++ Now I know you're lying.
c14091 +++$+++ I'm not. She just left.
c14091 +++$+++ What did she say?
c14091 +++$+++ She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother.
c14091 +++$+++ You're kidding.
c14091 +++$+++ I'm not.
c14091 +++$+++ Wow. You've had quite an evening.
c14091 +++$+++ She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
c14091 +++$+++ I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
c14091 +++$+++ Watch the store while I go home and change.
c14091 +++$+++ What happened to title dictates behavior?
c14091 +++$+++ This is my way of spitting water at life.
c14091 +++$+++ Hey, what about Veronica?
c14091 +++$+++ No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
c14091 +++$+++ You're a snake.
c14091 +++$+++ In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
c14091 +++$+++ You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this?
c14091 +++$+++ I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight.
c14091 +++$+++ I'll read the book.
c06991 +++$+++ For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
c06991 +++$+++ Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
c06991 +++$+++ You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
c06991 +++$+++ Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
c06991 +++$+++ I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
c06991 +++$+++ Your type will soon be extinct.
c02194 +++$+++ You're a thief?
c02194 +++$+++ Girl's gotta make a living.
c02194 +++$+++ Thank God.
c02194 +++$+++ First time I ever heard that.
c02194 +++$+++ I was expecting someone else.
c02194 +++$+++ You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
c14512 +++$+++ I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
c14512 +++$+++ I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
c14512 +++$+++ Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
c14512 +++$+++ I just wish we'd done it sooner.
c12268 +++$+++ Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
c12268 +++$+++ No. It won't do that.
c12268 +++$+++ No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
c02553 +++$+++ ...do you copy?
c02553 +++$+++ Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
c02553 +++$+++ I'm in the Second Containment area. It's pitch black in here. There must have been a coolant leak. Man, this shit is everywhere. I can't see a damn thing.
c14903 +++$+++ Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
c14903 +++$+++ We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
c14903 +++$+++ One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
c14903 +++$+++ No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
c00481 +++$+++ Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
c00481 +++$+++ We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
c00481 +++$+++ Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
c00481 +++$+++ I don't want to hear that word!
c00481 +++$+++ Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
c00481 +++$+++ What...?
c19840 +++$+++ You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
c19840 +++$+++ Wouldn't bother me.
c19840 +++$+++ Don't worry.  I can handle it.
c24981 +++$+++ Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
c24981 +++$+++ As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
c24981 +++$+++ It has to be the reality.
c12512 +++$+++ And so will we.
c12512 +++$+++ Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
c12512 +++$+++ You don't have a choice.  You're just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can.
c17208 +++$+++ My old man was a Marine.  He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
c17208 +++$+++ The Great War?
c17208 +++$+++ By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
c17208 +++$+++ That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
c18349 +++$+++ Good shit.
c18349 +++$+++ Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
c18349 +++$+++ It's what?
c18349 +++$+++ Darn it, Dave.
c16996 +++$+++ Is he?
c16996 +++$+++ Jack Carter.
c16996 +++$+++ Eric. Eric Paice.
c16996 +++$+++ What you doing around here then?
c16996 +++$+++ Didn't you know this is my home town?
c16996 +++$+++ Funny, that.
c10542 +++$+++ What's your problem?
c10542 +++$+++ Why'd you jump?
c10542 +++$+++ Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
c10542 +++$+++ Well, as soon as you grow some balls, let me know.
c16628 +++$+++ What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
c16628 +++$+++ I have pictures of him. Dealing...
c16628 +++$+++ So let's go! We run the pictures.
c16628 +++$+++ He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
c16628 +++$+++ Who?
c16628 +++$+++ Well, there we're in a gray area.
c16628 +++$+++ How gray?
c16628 +++$+++ I'd say charcoal.
c16628 +++$+++ Frank, you animal, I love it. I'll have the story by Thursday night, I swear to God.  I hope.
c19865 +++$+++ You know why...with my parents.
c19865 +++$+++ Well you can't blame them in a way.
c19865 +++$+++ I know...I know.
c18292 +++$+++ Yellowstone.
c18292 +++$+++ Old Faithful.
c18292 +++$+++ He notices.
c13731 +++$+++ What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
c13731 +++$+++ It's a start, anyway.
c13731 +++$+++ Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
c16197 +++$+++ Can't do it.  I cannot do it.
c16197 +++$+++ External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
c16197 +++$+++ Youthful high spirits.
c10429 +++$+++ D'you find an apartment?
c10429 +++$+++ Still looking.
c10429 +++$+++ I changed my life today. What did you do?
c10429 +++$+++ I changed my room at the Hotel.
c10429 +++$+++ Why?
c10429 +++$+++ The TV didn't work.
c10429 +++$+++ What Hotel are you staying at?
c10429 +++$+++ And what are you? A cop?
c10429 +++$+++ I'm a lawyer.
c10429 +++$+++ My ex-husband was a lawyer.
c10429 +++$+++ Really. How wonderful for you.
c10429 +++$+++ Yes. It was, actually.
c10429 +++$+++ Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
c10429 +++$+++ Who says I'm the one that called it off?
c10429 +++$+++ A brick house says you divorced him. I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner. And I'll take your word for it. Now you tell me the truth. Because you cannot lie to me. What's your name?
c10429 +++$+++ Laura.
c10429 +++$+++ My name's Frank. And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
c10429 +++$+++ You just got lucky.  D'you eat yet? Come on.
c16799 +++$+++ So, are you having fun yet?
c16799 +++$+++ Yeah...a lot.
c16799 +++$+++ There's something I haven't told you...
c11602 +++$+++ What cat  ?
c11602 +++$+++ One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
c11602 +++$+++ Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
c25087 +++$+++ Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
c25087 +++$+++ What?
c25087 +++$+++ Best thing that ever happened...
c07987 +++$+++ How!
c07987 +++$+++ It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
c07987 +++$+++ Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
c07987 +++$+++ And you wanted him to make a list!
c18704 +++$+++ She wasn't lying about the van.
c18704 +++$+++ Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
c18704 +++$+++ Sure.
c18704 +++$+++ Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my "Nervous Tick" ...
c00560 +++$+++ Maestro.
c00560 +++$+++ Good morning.
c00560 +++$+++ Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
c00560 +++$+++ Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
c00560 +++$+++ Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
c00560 +++$+++ Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
c00560 +++$+++ And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
c00560 +++$+++ Yes.
c00560 +++$+++ Is there a part for me?
c00560 +++$+++ No.
c00560 +++$+++ How do you know?
c00560 +++$+++ Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
c00560 +++$+++ Why not?
c00560 +++$+++ Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
c00560 +++$+++ Where?
c00560 +++$+++ In a harem.
c00560 +++$+++ What's that?
c00560 +++$+++ A brothel.
c00560 +++$+++ Oh!
c00560 +++$+++ A Turkish brothel.
c00560 +++$+++ My dear, it will hardly enhance your reputation to be celebrated throughout Vienna as a singing prostitute for a Turk.
c10125 +++$+++ The other thing is...
c10125 +++$+++ ...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
c10125 +++$+++ We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
c23538 +++$+++ No.  And he ain't been eating so good, either. He's got an empty stomach and it's gone to his head.
c23538 +++$+++ But, Joe - three weeks in Florida!  We could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
c23538 +++$+++ You've flipped your wig!
c23538 +++$+++ Josephine and Geraldine!  Come on!
c21164 +++$+++ Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
c21164 +++$+++ Why Edie, I--
c21164 +++$+++ How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me-- who?  -- who?
c21164 +++$+++ I wish I knew, Edie, But--
c21164 +++$+++ Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too-- don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
c21164 +++$+++ "In the church when you need me." Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?
c24641 +++$+++ Susie, as always, is free to say anything she thinks.  Go on, dear, say exactly what's on your mind, dear.
c24641 +++$+++ Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
c24641 +++$+++ May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
c24641 +++$+++ Son, you raise your voice again and you'll be outa here on your golden pratt!
c01571 +++$+++ Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
c01571 +++$+++ I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
c01571 +++$+++ Cheese is particularly troublesome.
c01571 +++$+++ Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
c01571 +++$+++ Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
c05181 +++$+++ Would you like some free condoms? They're boysenberry.
c05181 +++$+++ No thank you. I'm off sex.
c05181 +++$+++ Congrats.
c26023 +++$+++ For fuck's sake.
c26023 +++$+++ Sorry, mate, I'll get you another.
c26023 +++$+++ All down my fucking front, you fucking idiot.
c26023 +++$+++ Sorry's no going to dry me off, you cunt.
c08781 +++$+++ They guys treatin' you all right?
c08781 +++$+++ Yeah.
c08781 +++$+++ I know.
c19671 +++$+++ We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
c19671 +++$+++ We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
c19671 +++$+++ I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
c19671 +++$+++ Yeah?..well what are you getting at? You saying he has an agenda down here?
c19671 +++$+++ Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
c19671 +++$+++ That's the point.  He slipped up, and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.
c27443 +++$+++ Are you busy?
c27443 +++$+++ That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
c27443 +++$+++ Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
c27443 +++$+++ We only arrived a few minutes ago.
c27443 +++$+++ I know, but usually I can fall asleep right away.  It must be the strange room.
c27443 +++$+++ Well...
c27443 +++$+++ Well.. I suppose it would be all right, for just a little while.
c12483 +++$+++ Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
c12483 +++$+++ What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
c12483 +++$+++ That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
c02989 +++$+++ Dr. Lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  I have programed it to the coordinates of a Beryllium Sphere of sufficient density.
c02989 +++$+++ Thanks.
c02989 +++$+++ Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
c02989 +++$+++ Right... Sorry, sir.
c06387 +++$+++ What do you think?
c06387 +++$+++ Mmm, needs a little something.
c06387 +++$+++ What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
c06387 +++$+++ Yeah that's it.
c06387 +++$+++ Scottie...
c15688 +++$+++ How are you?
c15688 +++$+++ Okay.
c15688 +++$+++ You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
c23274 +++$+++ You all right, Marty?
c23274 +++$+++ Yeah.
c23274 +++$+++ There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
c23274 +++$+++ No.
c23274 +++$+++ Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
c23274 +++$+++ Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
c23274 +++$+++ What if it's some kind of monster?
c09350 +++$+++ We're alike. We are hunters. We have the gift. It's ancient times all over again. We stand between order and chaos. I need help. I can't carry on alone.
c09350 +++$+++ Maybe you should back off.
c09350 +++$+++ This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
c09350 +++$+++ Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.
c03571 +++$+++ And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
c03571 +++$+++ Exactly.
c03571 +++$+++ Shhh -- here he is now.
c20919 +++$+++ Taste it.
c20919 +++$+++ But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
c20919 +++$+++ Taste it.
c20919 +++$+++ No.
c20919 +++$+++ Why not?
c20919 +++$+++ There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
c11193 +++$+++ Oh sure.  I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not <u>all</u> that I am.
c11193 +++$+++ Of course, I didn't --
c11193 +++$+++ You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
c07786 +++$+++ The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
c07786 +++$+++ Is it awfully violent?
c07786 +++$+++ Most assuredly.
c07786 +++$+++ Fiendishly so.
c06110 +++$+++ That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?
c06110 +++$+++ They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
c06110 +++$+++ Then what you telling me to study in them for?
c06110 +++$+++ Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at?
c26033 +++$+++ It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
c26033 +++$+++ Unless you get caught.
c26033 +++$+++ So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
c26033 +++$+++ So why have you told me about it?
c26033 +++$+++ Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
c26033 +++$+++ I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
c26033 +++$+++ What? Steady like?
c26033 +++$+++ That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
c26033 +++$+++ And what age are you? Thirteen? Fourteen?
c26033 +++$+++ Sixteen next month.
c26033 +++$+++ What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
c25092 +++$+++ It was just a soldier. I was trying to punch his major in the eye.
c25092 +++$+++ No, a major, were you really?
c25092 +++$+++ I've heard of him, of course, but I didn't exactly know him.
c07276 +++$+++ Don't  Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
c07276 +++$+++ Man, you have got to get some therapy.
c07276 +++$+++ I said 'got it?'
c07276 +++$+++ You made your point...  I was wrong.
c09323 +++$+++ Thanks for the ride.
c09323 +++$+++ They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
c09323 +++$+++ None taken.
c09323 +++$+++ Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
c09323 +++$+++ You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
c09323 +++$+++ The Academy, then CIIAC.
c09323 +++$+++ I read your white paper. It's sort of like the Bible for what they're trying to do in Computer Crime.
c09323 +++$+++ Five months. I love it.
c11454 +++$+++ So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
c11454 +++$+++ I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
c11454 +++$+++ <u>What</u>?
c13186 +++$+++ Listen to me.  You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it.  I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.  And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about.  It isn't that I'm down on myself.  Trust me, I stink.
c13186 +++$+++ I trust you.
c13186 +++$+++ I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports.  I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
c13186 +++$+++ I don't write.
c08191 +++$+++ I'm so glad you're here.
c08191 +++$+++ I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
c08191 +++$+++ It's okay. I understand.
c08191 +++$+++ How is she?
c08191 +++$+++ Yes... Sometimes you have to give them candy.
c22006 +++$+++ Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
c22006 +++$+++ Hello, Daddy. How are you?
c22006 +++$+++ About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
c22006 +++$+++ It's Yankee whisky to me.
c24765 +++$+++ I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
c24765 +++$+++ A game?
c24765 +++$+++ It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
c24765 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c24765 +++$+++ The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
c24765 +++$+++ You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
c24765 +++$+++ You should be.
c11891 +++$+++ Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
c11891 +++$+++ Okay.
c11891 +++$+++ Okay.
c20057 +++$+++ Where'd you go?
c20057 +++$+++ Hit a couple of jazz clubs.  Fell back to her place.
c20057 +++$+++ Where?
c20057 +++$+++ Verdado.
c20057 +++$+++ Verdado where?
c20057 +++$+++ It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
c20057 +++$+++ Havana, Cuba...?
c20057 +++$+++ No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
c20057 +++$+++ ...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
c20057 +++$+++ No.
c20057 +++$+++ You're not makin' a move on her...?
c20057 +++$+++ Oh, that makes it okay, then.
c15807 +++$+++ Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
c15807 +++$+++ It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
c15807 +++$+++ Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
c15807 +++$+++ Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
c15807 +++$+++ I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.
c15973 +++$+++ You speak Latin?
c15973 +++$+++ Ego te abslovo.
c15973 +++$+++ Quod nomen mihi est?
c15973 +++$+++ Bon Jour.
c15973 +++$+++ La plume de ma tante.
c17772 +++$+++ What would <u>that</u> be?
c17772 +++$+++ He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice.
c17772 +++$+++ Now, why in the world would he do that?
c17772 +++$+++ I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
c17772 +++$+++ What reaction?
c17772 +++$+++ Exactly.
c17772 +++$+++ Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
c17772 +++$+++ Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
c17772 +++$+++ We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
c17772 +++$+++ Try Barney Clark.
c17772 +++$+++ He is...?
c17772 +++$+++ He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
c17772 +++$+++ And how would you know that?
c17772 +++$+++ Before "The Change," Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study.
c17772 +++$+++ You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
c17772 +++$+++ ....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
c17772 +++$+++ No, no, of course not.
c17772 +++$+++ Tell him to give it to an orphanage.
c27240 +++$+++ Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!
c27240 +++$+++ I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
c27240 +++$+++ Goodbye, folks!
c08875 +++$+++ Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
c08875 +++$+++ That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
c08875 +++$+++ I called it the last time, didn't I?
c08730 +++$+++ How much sleep do you need?
c08730 +++$+++ How much sleep?
c08730 +++$+++ How long can you go without sleep?
c08730 +++$+++ Well, when you do go to sleep: barricade your door.
c05214 +++$+++ By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.
c05214 +++$+++ Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
c05214 +++$+++ Yeah?
c05214 +++$+++ Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
c05214 +++$+++ Nah... how much money have you got?
c07936 +++$+++ Don't you ever have any problems?
c07936 +++$+++ I have one now.
c07936 +++$+++ So do I.
c07936 +++$+++ Tell me about it.
c07936 +++$+++ Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
c07936 +++$+++ He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
c07936 +++$+++ Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
c07936 +++$+++ Homework. It's more interesting.
c07936 +++$+++ What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
c07936 +++$+++ Nothing, thank heaven.
c07936 +++$+++ Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
c07936 +++$+++ Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong.
c20796 +++$+++ At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
c20796 +++$+++ Why did you?
c20796 +++$+++ I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
c20796 +++$+++ 'Been up north?
c20796 +++$+++ Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
c20796 +++$+++ Well, it ain't that good up there neither. Might as well make it here. 'Course I ain't really makin' it now.
c06312 +++$+++ That's good.
c06312 +++$+++ No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
c06312 +++$+++ Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
c09371 +++$+++ Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
c09371 +++$+++ No...
c09371 +++$+++ You should. A lot of comics play Vegas.
c09371 +++$+++ Well, I'm afraid it's not that easy...
c09371 +++$+++ Why not?
c09371 +++$+++ There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
c09371 +++$+++ Who's your booking agent?
c09371 +++$+++ Oh? You know about booking agents... I don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
c09371 +++$+++ Well, who represents you back east?
c09371 +++$+++ What do you do, Trent?
c01963 +++$+++ I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
c01963 +++$+++ There seems to be no secret about that.
c01963 +++$+++ It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
c25379 +++$+++ Do you know how to count?
c25379 +++$+++ Of course I do?  Bring them up!
c25379 +++$+++ Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
c25379 +++$+++ But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
c25379 +++$+++ He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
c25379 +++$+++ To hell with your voices -- it's time to face facts!  We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you.  You should go home, Jeanne.
c18906 +++$+++ What's the matter?
c18906 +++$+++ Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
c18906 +++$+++ It's gone out so quickly?
c18906 +++$+++ -- You mean my Chief has it.
c11125 +++$+++ "Liebestraum."
c11125 +++$+++ I just played it.
c11125 +++$+++ Play it again.
c11125 +++$+++ But that was the fourth straight time.
c11125 +++$+++ Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
c11125 +++$+++ No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
c11125 +++$+++ "Liebestraum."
c11125 +++$+++ My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano. Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "Liebestraum."
c26113 +++$+++ You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.
c26113 +++$+++ Look...just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
c26113 +++$+++ Well, great, that's no sweat -- I play video games better than anybody.
c17656 +++$+++ Ever done anything like this before?
c17656 +++$+++ Only minimum security.
c17656 +++$+++ I see.
c17656 +++$+++ What does that mean?
c17656 +++$+++ It means... I see.
c17656 +++$+++ You don't have to make this harder than it already is.
c17656 +++$+++ I couldn't if I tried.
c17656 +++$+++ You don't have anything to worry about. He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.
c00874 +++$+++ So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
c00874 +++$+++ He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
c00874 +++$+++ What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
c00874 +++$+++ I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
c00874 +++$+++ Do you feel that way?
c00874 +++$+++ No. Not really.
c00874 +++$+++ Where did Paul hang out?
c00874 +++$+++ Hang...out?
c00874 +++$+++ Yeah. You know...hang out.
c00874 +++$+++ Let me think. The Newport. Harry's. Fluties. Endochine. Nell's. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The regular places.
c00874 +++$+++ He had a yacht?
c00874 +++$+++ And where did he go to school?
c14995 +++$+++ Please! Please mister, please! This is vital I go to Saigon. This is very important. Most important.
c14995 +++$+++ Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
c14995 +++$+++ That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
c14995 +++$+++ I will not betray my country. No. Ne-ver!
c21390 +++$+++ Damn that Charlie I
c21390 +++$+++ It's not Charlie. It's me.
c21390 +++$+++ Peggy, let me ask you something.  You're not... expecting are you?
c21390 +++$+++ At my age? Don't be silly.
c21390 +++$+++ Thank God for that.
c21390 +++$+++ Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
c21390 +++$+++ Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
c21390 +++$+++ Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
c21390 +++$+++ All right. But this better be good.
c21390 +++$+++ I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
c21390 +++$+++ Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
c21390 +++$+++ I think they're going to deregulate it.
c21390 +++$+++ That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
c21390 +++$+++ Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
c21390 +++$+++ I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
c21390 +++$+++ Evelyn, take her to her room!
c14640 +++$+++ What are you reading?
c14640 +++$+++ Of Human Bondage.
c14640 +++$+++ Somerset Maugham.
c14640 +++$+++ You're not gonna start that again.
c02759 +++$+++ You're poisoning that child's mind.
c02759 +++$+++ I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
c02759 +++$+++ You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
c02759 +++$+++ They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
c02759 +++$+++ How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
c02759 +++$+++ That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
c02453 +++$+++ Are you all right?
c02453 +++$+++ No, I'm not.
c02453 +++$+++ You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
c02453 +++$+++ I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
c13449 +++$+++ Fuck you! Fuck you!
c13449 +++$+++ Yeah?
c13449 +++$+++ You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
c13449 +++$+++ You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who you're fuckin' with?
c18369 +++$+++ I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
c18369 +++$+++ Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
c18369 +++$+++ It's beyond mere physical attraction.
c18369 +++$+++ That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
c18369 +++$+++ Truly? Do speak.
c18369 +++$+++ My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
c18369 +++$+++ How do you know this shit?
c18369 +++$+++ They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
c18369 +++$+++ You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
c18369 +++$+++ Good thinking Marge.
c23852 +++$+++ The sphere looks different.
c23852 +++$+++ What do you mean, different?
c23852 +++$+++ How's Harry?
c13117 +++$+++ I hate vodka.
c13117 +++$+++ Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
c13117 +++$+++ I'll drink to that.
c13117 +++$+++ Greatest job in the world.
c17317 +++$+++ He didn't call?
c17317 +++$+++ He's with his friends.
c17317 +++$+++ What kind of person doesn't call?
c17317 +++$+++ He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
c17317 +++$+++ If he was so grown up he'd get you two an apartment.
c17317 +++$+++ Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.
c07928 +++$+++ What a day I've had!
c07928 +++$+++ Tired?
c07928 +++$+++ Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
c07928 +++$+++ She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
c11196 +++$+++ Nice car.
c11196 +++$+++ I'm glad you think so.
c11196 +++$+++ No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
c14594 +++$+++ Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain.  He said you were practicing deep meditation.
c14594 +++$+++ Yes.
c14594 +++$+++ The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
c14594 +++$+++ I left the training early.
c14594 +++$+++ Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
c14594 +++$+++ During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
c14594 +++$+++ You were enlightened?
c14594 +++$+++ No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
c14594 +++$+++ What was it?
c14594 +++$+++ Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
c14594 +++$+++ Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.
c13522 +++$+++ A hearty breakfast is the start of a great morning...
c13522 +++$+++ Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
c13522 +++$+++ Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
c13522 +++$+++ Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
c13522 +++$+++ Maybe.
c13522 +++$+++ Pretty good...Mom, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate...letting me stay, getting me the job--I've been a mess. I'm still a mess. It's just...we have to start having a different conversation. I can't take..
c04644 +++$+++ Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
c04644 +++$+++ Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
c04644 +++$+++ Did work.
c04644 +++$+++ Did work.
c04644 +++$+++ That, you have to discuss with CBS Business Affairs. But, for something like this, I would say anywhere between 10, 12 thousand.
c17108 +++$+++ You've grown so tall... so tall in the last year.  You're much taller than me.
c17108 +++$+++ I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
c17108 +++$+++ Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
c17108 +++$+++ Well, that's alright... alright. Good.  You'll graduate in another year, isn't that right?  You know... I never finished college.  I was a good student, but I never finished. Of course, there was a war then.
c27248 +++$+++ ...bed.
c27248 +++$+++ Oh, no -- no!
c27248 +++$+++ Oh, you....
c23088 +++$+++ Later. But first -- him.
c23088 +++$+++ David?
c23088 +++$+++ Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
c23088 +++$+++ Oh, good.
c23088 +++$+++ He won't do anything for me, but for you --
c23088 +++$+++ Forget it.
c23088 +++$+++ He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
c23088 +++$+++ And the money?
c23088 +++$+++ We could put it somewhere.
c23088 +++$+++ Where he can't get it?
c23088 +++$+++ Forget it -- he'll come down.
c19369 +++$+++ You know Vinovich?
c19369 +++$+++ Sure.  Vivovich.
c19369 +++$+++ He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
c19369 +++$+++ I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
c19369 +++$+++ People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
c19369 +++$+++ For what?
c19369 +++$+++ Well... nobody.
c09841 +++$+++ Something the matter?
c09841 +++$+++ No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
c09841 +++$+++ Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
c09841 +++$+++ Well... what do I know?  I'm a bachelor.  Lucy... this is going to be a very special night, I promise you.
c13353 +++$+++ I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
c13353 +++$+++ But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
c13353 +++$+++ So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
c13353 +++$+++ Phil, I can understand. You're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are not on the floor. I got thousands of players. I got five hundred dealers.  They're all lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day. I have to let them know I'm watching all the details, all the time; that there is not one single thing I will not catch as I am over here.
c01715 +++$+++ Armored trucks are very difficult to steal, Anthony.
c01715 +++$+++ I know. But once you get inside you're home free.
c01715 +++$+++ Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
c01715 +++$+++ It's not a plan. It's just --
c01715 +++$+++ Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
c01715 +++$+++ True.
c04407 +++$+++ Your shot.
c04407 +++$+++ You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
c04407 +++$+++ Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
c04693 +++$+++ Is that you?
c04693 +++$+++ Me. Yes.
c04693 +++$+++ Oh. And that is -- mom?
c04693 +++$+++ You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes.
c12246 +++$+++ God, you're anatomically correct!
c12246 +++$+++ Just <u>say</u> it.
c12246 +++$+++ You were the snake!  Right?  I know.  I saw you.
c12246 +++$+++ You've <u>got</u> to say it!
c12246 +++$+++ No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
c12246 +++$+++ How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
c12246 +++$+++ How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
c22574 +++$+++ How's Jonah taking it?
c22574 +++$+++ It'll take him a while to come around.  A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
c22574 +++$+++ Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
c01299 +++$+++ See! The big guy likes it.
c01299 +++$+++ I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
c01299 +++$+++ Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
c01299 +++$+++ I'm going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
c01299 +++$+++ Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
c01299 +++$+++ Yes!
c01299 +++$+++ I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
c01299 +++$+++ Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
c11053 +++$+++ She's quite a girl, that what's-her name...
c11053 +++$+++ Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
c11053 +++$+++ The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
c11053 +++$+++ Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
c11053 +++$+++ All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
c19562 +++$+++ C'mon guys, settle down --
c19562 +++$+++ Cynthia?
c19562 +++$+++ What?
c19562 +++$+++ How much time do we have?
c19562 +++$+++ Not enough, what do you want?
c19562 +++$+++ I should maybe go to the bathroom.
c19562 +++$+++ Can you hold it?
c19562 +++$+++ Just hold it, you'll be fine.
c24151 +++$+++ Pretty cool, Stanley.
c24151 +++$+++ Thanks.
c24151 +++$+++ How'd you get it?
c24151 +++$+++ It's my Dad's He hides it under some old TV Guides in his closet.
c24151 +++$+++ Gee, your Dad's smart.
c24151 +++$+++ I know.
c24151 +++$+++ No, I don't think so...
c06762 +++$+++ You two timing psychotic bastard.
c06762 +++$+++ Darling, you've got the wrong idea.
c06762 +++$+++ I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women. It doesn't mean a thing.  Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our night. It's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. She's just a plaything, a trifle... You're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. I adore you. I worship you. I want to make you my bride.
c10472 +++$+++ A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
c10472 +++$+++ It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
c10472 +++$+++ We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
c10472 +++$+++ If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!
c05127 +++$+++ My husband tells me you're in sharks.
c05127 +++$+++ I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
c05127 +++$+++ I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
c21980 +++$+++ Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
c21980 +++$+++ Nobody.
c21980 +++$+++ But who were they?
c21980 +++$+++ They were just bad men, that's all.
c21980 +++$+++ In what sense were they bad?
c21980 +++$+++ Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute?
c14558 +++$+++ This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
c14558 +++$+++ Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
c14558 +++$+++ Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
c14558 +++$+++ That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?
c13765 +++$+++ Yeah?
c13765 +++$+++ I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
c13765 +++$+++ Why?
c13765 +++$+++ He feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
c13765 +++$+++ He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
c13765 +++$+++ I think I know how to restore your reputation.
c13765 +++$+++ Can I come in? I'll need to use the phone.
c24608 +++$+++ Yes, I'll accept the charges.
c24608 +++$+++ Daddy?
c24608 +++$+++ Yes.
c24608 +++$+++ I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
c24608 +++$+++ News?
c24608 +++$+++ Don't you want to hear?
c24608 +++$+++ Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
c24608 +++$+++ You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
c24608 +++$+++ Tell me your news, Zoe.
c24608 +++$+++ Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
c24608 +++$+++ No.  But this is.  They wouldn't take my blood.
c15564 +++$+++ It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
c15564 +++$+++ I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
c15564 +++$+++ On what evidence?
c15564 +++$+++ None.  Call it a hunch.
c15564 +++$+++ Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
c15564 +++$+++ Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
c15564 +++$+++ Do you have any proof?
c15564 +++$+++ I'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for.
c10548 +++$+++ Don't look down.  Look in my eyes! Climb!  We'll do it together.
c10548 +++$+++ I can't.
c10548 +++$+++ Aaauuuhhh!!!
c23511 +++$+++ They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
c23511 +++$+++ And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
c23511 +++$+++ It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
c23511 +++$+++ More than eager.  He was out to make a point.
c24267 +++$+++ You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
c24267 +++$+++ I don't know.
c24267 +++$+++ You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
c24267 +++$+++ Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
c24267 +++$+++ Oh, it's very complicated, huh?
c24267 +++$+++ Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?
c05880 +++$+++ What is it?
c05880 +++$+++ See that spot?
c05880 +++$+++ Yes.
c05880 +++$+++ That's where we were this morning. He had it marked. Right on the border of Tibet. Here's where civilization ends. We must be a thousand miles beyond it - just a blank on the map.
c05880 +++$+++ It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
c02625 +++$+++ 'Scuse me.
c02625 +++$+++ I know it can't be easy. Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny. At least they can go out in public. But for you? People staring. Whispering behind your back...
c02625 +++$+++ I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
c07865 +++$+++ That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
c07865 +++$+++ I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
c07865 +++$+++ You know?
c07865 +++$+++ Yeah. Do me a favor.
c07865 +++$+++ Sure. What is it?
c07865 +++$+++ Hit me in the face.
c07865 +++$+++ You want me to do what?
c07865 +++$+++ You heard me, I said hit me.
c07865 +++$+++ C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
c07865 +++$+++ Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
c07865 +++$+++ Here's your glove.
c01026 +++$+++ Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
c01026 +++$+++ I feel sure of it.
c01026 +++$+++ She was ...
c05556 +++$+++ A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
c05556 +++$+++ Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
c05556 +++$+++ Easily spoken...
c05556 +++$+++ Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
c05556 +++$+++ Never mind.  Just do it!  Retrieve the arrows somehow.
c09025 +++$+++ Status?
c09025 +++$+++ The tank will be finished by morning...
c09025 +++$+++ That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
c09025 +++$+++ No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
c09025 +++$+++ Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
c09025 +++$+++ Our <u>mission</u>! Goddam it, Spock, you're talking about the end of every life on Earth! You're half human, haven't you got any goddamned feelings about <u>that</u>!!
c11649 +++$+++ Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
c11649 +++$+++ I'm living proof of that sad fact.
c11649 +++$+++ No, I better stay at my post.
c03150 +++$+++ Maureen.
c03150 +++$+++ What?
c03150 +++$+++ Maureen?
c05235 +++$+++ You thirsty?
c05235 +++$+++ Yeah, I feel dehydrated.
c05235 +++$+++ You got any money?
c05235 +++$+++ Three pennies and a ball of lint.
c05235 +++$+++ Unzip my pack, yo.
c16400 +++$+++ From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
c16400 +++$+++ ... no, no, no...
c16400 +++$+++ No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
c16400 +++$+++ Why are you doing this?!
c16400 +++$+++ I'm doing this for us.
c16400 +++$+++ Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
c16400 +++$+++ If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
c16400 +++$+++ You will.  You know you will.
c01126 +++$+++ Knock it off. Now.
c01126 +++$+++ Tell him about me, Shadow?
c01126 +++$+++ Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
c01126 +++$+++ Did he tell you how we finally met?
c01126 +++$+++ Oh, but it's a good story, Shadow. You're depriving our famous young friend here...
c02525 +++$+++ I really like you, Mary. You know that.
c02525 +++$+++ Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
c02525 +++$+++ Thanks, Stan.
c06990 +++$+++ Why do you need my finger?
c06990 +++$+++ Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
c06990 +++$+++ And where are we?
c06990 +++$+++ Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
c06990 +++$+++ I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
c06990 +++$+++ I don't have to but I find it natural.
c06990 +++$+++ I'll try.
c00165 +++$+++ I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave, that you're upset. Why don't you take a stress pill and get some rest.
c00165 +++$+++ Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
c00165 +++$+++ Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
c13927 +++$+++ What's wrong?
c13927 +++$+++ Your eye.
c13927 +++$+++ What about it?
c13927 +++$+++ There's something black in the green part of your eye.
c13927 +++$+++ Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
c13927 +++$+++ ...Yes, sort of a birthmark...
c08806 +++$+++ You coming in?
c08806 +++$+++ No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
c08806 +++$+++ We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
c08806 +++$+++ So, what are you doing tonight?
c08806 +++$+++ Shooting.
c08806 +++$+++ Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood.  'Bye, Dad.
c02273 +++$+++ So, we call them... IMGs.
c02273 +++$+++ Infant Memory Generators.
c02273 +++$+++ And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
c19330 +++$+++ I know you?
c19330 +++$+++ Name's Otis.
c19330 +++$+++ Otis what?
c19330 +++$+++ Payne.
c19330 +++$+++ One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
c19330 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c19330 +++$+++ I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
c19330 +++$+++ Why you think that was?
c12095 +++$+++ I started racing after my parents died.  There was something about the speed, the danger, that took me out of myself, that made the hurt go away.  You wouldn't understand.
c12095 +++$+++ You'd be surprised.
c12095 +++$+++ Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
c21373 +++$+++ What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
c21373 +++$+++ What?
c21373 +++$+++ You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
c21373 +++$+++ I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
c23929 +++$+++ He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
c23929 +++$+++ Yeah, sure, I guess.
c23929 +++$+++ No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a chance.
c23929 +++$+++ What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
c23929 +++$+++ You two have so much in common.
c24132 +++$+++ Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
c24132 +++$+++ Fine.
c24132 +++$+++ Ready for tomorrow?
c24132 +++$+++ The SATs, knucklehead. SCOOBY I'm not taking them.
c04221 +++$+++ They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
c04221 +++$+++ Get the Governor on the phone!
c04221 +++$+++ Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
c21810 +++$+++ -hold it, hold it-
c21810 +++$+++ What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
c21810 +++$+++ -- wait, just wait --
c21810 +++$+++ Keep your shirt on. Let me read.  Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
c23034 +++$+++ You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
c23034 +++$+++ What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
c23034 +++$+++ To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
c23034 +++$+++ You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
c23034 +++$+++ Then I will go with you.
c23034 +++$+++ You cannot, Wessex will kill you
c23034 +++$+++ Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
c24576 +++$+++ If that bastard does subpoena me, if he forces me to go over this again, then all those other lawyers will line up behind him and try and do the same thing.
c24576 +++$+++ That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
c24576 +++$+++ That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
c24576 +++$+++ We've got lawyers suing lawyers because some people were stupid enough to sign on with more than one of the bastards.  We've got people pointing fingers, making side deals, and dickering over percentages. Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to sue the rescue squad.  The rescue squad.  Because they didn't act fast enough.
c03436 +++$+++ What are you looking for?
c03436 +++$+++ My belt.
c03436 +++$+++ Don't you have it on?
c03436 +++$+++ No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
c03436 +++$+++ The marble?
c03436 +++$+++ Oh.
c08793 +++$+++ What did you do tonight?
c08793 +++$+++ I watched TV.
c08793 +++$+++ I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
c19687 +++$+++ And?...
c19687 +++$+++ I killed them.
c19687 +++$+++ Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
c19767 +++$+++ So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
c19767 +++$+++ Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
c19767 +++$+++ Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
c26032 +++$+++ You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
c26032 +++$+++ It's Iggy Pop.
c26032 +++$+++ Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
c26032 +++$+++ The point is, you've got to find something new.
c10339 +++$+++ I'm here to investigate the murder of Teresa Banks.
c10339 +++$+++ Well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. I don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. In fact, when the state boys called me about a "J. Edgar" coming up I think I said, "So what?"
c10339 +++$+++ Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
c10339 +++$+++ Well, little fella, let me put it this way. The operative word here would be "Federal". With or without the semantics of all this, I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks, both while living and deceased.
c08783 +++$+++ You still going away?
c08783 +++$+++ I don't know...
c08783 +++$+++ I think it's probably still a good idea.
c11376 +++$+++ Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
c11376 +++$+++ I was a great beauty.
c11376 +++$+++ Uh, how did this personality come about?
c11376 +++$+++ I was very charming.
c11376 +++$+++ Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
c15500 +++$+++ Who, me?  Nooo.  I never... I don't know anything about that stuff, Mr. M. Besides, that's Tracy Flick's thing. She's always working so hard and --
c15500 +++$+++ Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
c15500 +++$+++ And she's super-nice
c15500 +++$+++ Yeah.  But one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, doesn't it? That's more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
c15500 +++$+++ Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
c15500 +++$+++ Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
c15500 +++$+++ takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
c15500 +++$+++ No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
c04947 +++$+++ That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
c04947 +++$+++ I was told ten thousand in each pack.
c04947 +++$+++ I never have. It's not my money.
c07322 +++$+++ What's your name, boy?
c07322 +++$+++ Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
c07322 +++$+++ Not exactly, sir.
c24286 +++$+++ Hey, Pony.
c24286 +++$+++ Hey, man. Jeff. How're you doin?
c24286 +++$+++ Good, man.
c24286 +++$+++ Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
c24286 +++$+++ Well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, Is that your limo?
c24286 +++$+++ Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
c24286 +++$+++ No, it's not...
c24286 +++$+++ Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
c24286 +++$+++ Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
c24286 +++$+++ Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
c24286 +++$+++ Yeah.
c24286 +++$+++ We sold, uh, over ninety thousand units and uh... and Danny says that we're gonna get a gold record. Yeah.
c24286 +++$+++ Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
c24286 +++$+++ Nah, nah, nah, nah.
c24286 +++$+++ Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
c24286 +++$+++ Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
c24286 +++$+++ Yeah.
c24286 +++$+++ The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
c24286 +++$+++ Yeah, good.
c22505 +++$+++ You take the microwave?
c22505 +++$+++ What am I going to do with a microwave?
c22505 +++$+++ So you're angry.  Big deal.
c26655 +++$+++ Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
c26655 +++$+++ More than you think.
c26655 +++$+++ How do you know? Personal experience?
c26655 +++$+++ Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
c26655 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c26655 +++$+++ What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
c26655 +++$+++ You sound so disapproving, Midge.
c26655 +++$+++ No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
c26655 +++$+++ I had to quit, Midge.
c26655 +++$+++ Why?
c26655 +++$+++ I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
c26655 +++$+++ It wasn't your fault.
c26655 +++$+++ I know. Everybody tells me.
c26655 +++$+++ Johnny, the doctors explained --
c26655 +++$+++ I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
c26655 +++$+++ Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
c26655 +++$+++ And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
c26655 +++$+++ It's where you belong.
c26655 +++$+++ Ah, Johnny-O...
c12596 +++$+++ ...You know that car?
c12596 +++$+++ No.
c12596 +++$+++ I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
c08194 +++$+++ "Ray!"
c08194 +++$+++ "Fucked me."
c08194 +++$+++ "Fucked me."
c20061 +++$+++ From whom...?
c20061 +++$+++ A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono.
c20061 +++$+++ From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think.
c02872 +++$+++ Have you forgotten about your sister?
c02872 +++$+++ They're gonna kill us. They get us across the border, they're gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.
c02872 +++$+++ If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
c02872 +++$+++ Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
c02872 +++$+++ What about Kate?
c02872 +++$+++ They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
c02872 +++$+++ If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
c18379 +++$+++ Hey Wendy.
c18379 +++$+++ Hey Sandy.
c18379 +++$+++ Yeah? See ya.
c00658 +++$+++ Surely you're not suggesting...
c00658 +++$+++ David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
c00658 +++$+++ Dr. Hirsch?
c00658 +++$+++ Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
c00658 +++$+++ Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
c24114 +++$+++ You don't trust me to be alone with them.
c24114 +++$+++ I trust you of course I do but --
c24114 +++$+++ But?  But what?
c24114 +++$+++ I know how responsible, caring adults parent children.  I'm bribe 'em.  But 'em a dog or something.  Maybe a Doberman.
c25226 +++$+++ It was a trap. I'm back at square one.
c25226 +++$+++ Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
c25226 +++$+++ One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The...
c24074 +++$+++ You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me <u>now</u>?  In front of the whole <u>world</u>? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
c24074 +++$+++ That's so weak.
c24074 +++$+++ Honey, she won't d...
c23643 +++$+++ :--THE STRANGE ENDINGS OF NATURE THEY HAVE SEEN, MAY GIVE THE WORLD NEW POINTS OF VIEW AND MAKE THEIR LOVING, LIVING, AND DOING PRECIOUS TO ALL HUMAN...
c23643 +++$+++ :The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
c23643 +++$+++ :...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
c23643 +++$+++ :HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
c23643 +++$+++ :...THE CHANCE TO SOAR IN THE DIM BLUE AIR ABOVE SMOKE IS TO THEIR...
c23643 +++$+++ :His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
c23643 +++$+++ :His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
c20949 +++$+++ Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
c20949 +++$+++ Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
c20949 +++$+++ Don't hold back on us, Max.  We need all the help we can get.
c20949 +++$+++ Fucked up chromosomes, man.  Think about it.  Their parents all dropped acid in the Sixties.
c20949 +++$+++ Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
c25930 +++$+++ You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
c25930 +++$+++ Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
c25930 +++$+++ "Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
c06323 +++$+++ Colonel!
c06323 +++$+++ You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
c06323 +++$+++ Has he been here?
c06323 +++$+++ No.
c06323 +++$+++ Have you seen him?
c06323 +++$+++ I ain't seen him for a week.
c06323 +++$+++ Where's Connell?
c06323 +++$+++ Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
c19396 +++$+++ It's for my daughter.
c19396 +++$+++ How old is she?
c19396 +++$+++ Oh, she'll love it.
c01768 +++$+++ Give me the keys, Dignan.
c01768 +++$+++ I can't do that, Bob.
c01768 +++$+++ Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
c01768 +++$+++ Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
c01371 +++$+++ You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
c01371 +++$+++ I'm trying to quit.
c01371 +++$+++ I've got news for you. It's not working.
c01371 +++$+++ I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
c01371 +++$+++ Nobody's that unhappy.
c01371 +++$+++ Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
c01371 +++$+++ I don't want anyone to die.
c01371 +++$+++ Except for Small Eyes.
c21743 +++$+++ You always been rich?
c21743 +++$+++ No.
c21743 +++$+++ Easier than learning how to be poor.  My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  And he took his money with him.
c14455 +++$+++ Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
c14455 +++$+++ That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
c14455 +++$+++ When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
c21563 +++$+++ Don't I even get my face slapped?
c21563 +++$+++ Would you mind?
c21563 +++$+++ Okay. You win.
c21563 +++$+++ If I change my mind.
c11935 +++$+++ ...Well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
c11935 +++$+++ He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
c11935 +++$+++ Okay, but that doesn't excuse his -
c11935 +++$+++ What. What don't I understand?
c21129 +++$+++ I'm hungry.
c21129 +++$+++ You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
c21129 +++$+++ Nothing.
c18077 +++$+++ I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
c18077 +++$+++ Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
c18077 +++$+++ But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
c25834 +++$+++ We must talk, darling.  It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
c25834 +++$+++ What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
c25834 +++$+++ Not exactly...
c25834 +++$+++ Yes, I know.  You are a good woman.
c09188 +++$+++ Recognize this?
c09188 +++$+++ It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
c09188 +++$+++ They must have picked it up in space.
c13384 +++$+++ Hello.
c13384 +++$+++ Sammy.
c13384 +++$+++ Yeah, uh, who's this?
c13384 +++$+++ Nick?
c12717 +++$+++ George, you look terrible.
c12717 +++$+++ Yeah, well...
c12717 +++$+++ Diego?
c12717 +++$+++ Yeah.
c12717 +++$+++ Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
c12717 +++$+++ I didn't come here to drink scotch.
c12717 +++$+++ I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
c12717 +++$+++ You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
c12717 +++$+++ It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
c12717 +++$+++ You're saying life will take care of Diego?
c12717 +++$+++ Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
c12717 +++$+++ I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
c12717 +++$+++ I'm sorry, George.
c12717 +++$+++ Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George.
c27108 +++$+++ Well? Surprised?
c27108 +++$+++ What is all this? When are you coming home?
c27108 +++$+++ Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
c27108 +++$+++ Mom. Believe me. I could buy all that AND the factories they came from.
c00094 +++$+++ Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
c00094 +++$+++ ...Do you really want me to forget about you?
c00094 +++$+++ Daphne, I...
c06849 +++$+++ What you see?
c06849 +++$+++ That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
c06849 +++$+++ No, man, just wait.
c21010 +++$+++ Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
c21010 +++$+++ Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
c21010 +++$+++ Buggered?
c21010 +++$+++ Really?
c05416 +++$+++ No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
c05416 +++$+++ You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
c05416 +++$+++ I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
c17274 +++$+++ I go with you --
c17274 +++$+++ That what you want?
c17274 +++$+++ Okay.
c05693 +++$+++ No.
c05693 +++$+++ At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship.
c05693 +++$+++ Does that mean I'm in?
c05693 +++$+++ I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
c05693 +++$+++ What'd you say?
c05693 +++$+++ Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
c05249 +++$+++ You should come back with me to Steven's house.
c05249 +++$+++ Tonight?
c05249 +++$+++ Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
c05249 +++$+++ Come on. You can rave on another night.
c04247 +++$+++ He could always make me laugh.
c04247 +++$+++ We did the decent thing.
c04247 +++$+++ This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
c04247 +++$+++ We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
c20176 +++$+++ I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
c20176 +++$+++ Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
c20176 +++$+++ Now you've hurt me, Paul.
c25571 +++$+++ They shouldn't have been here.
c25571 +++$+++ We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
c25571 +++$+++ This is miles from the battle lines. They were probably deserters.
c25571 +++$+++ They shouldn't have been out this way, that's all I'm saying.
c09551 +++$+++ You like ball games?
c09551 +++$+++ Huh?
c09551 +++$+++ Nah. I ain't interested.
c21530 +++$+++ Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?
c21530 +++$+++ Don't bother
c21530 +++$+++ Dodge ... he's not like me at all. But he makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew. I understand why  he's here. But you...You're no seeker. You're negative.
c21530 +++$+++ I'd like to know why not. You thought life on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You ran away.
c07982 +++$+++ You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
c07982 +++$+++ No.  At dawn.
c07982 +++$+++ Why?
c07982 +++$+++ I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
c07982 +++$+++ Well, stop hiding and stand up.  I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
c26258 +++$+++ That would explain the bruises, I guess.  The struggle.
c26258 +++$+++ You want to go in?  Examine him?
c26258 +++$+++ Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
c26258 +++$+++ James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
c26258 +++$+++ I'll be right here...just in case.
c17374 +++$+++ Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
c17374 +++$+++ No, I don't.
c17374 +++$+++ Why not?
c17374 +++$+++ I gave that up when my wife got sick.
c17374 +++$+++ Is that why you didn't write anything else?
c17374 +++$+++ I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
c17374 +++$+++ Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
c17374 +++$+++ Yeah.
c17374 +++$+++ What happened to that guy from Kentucky?
c17374 +++$+++ Lon? He got married. He has a kid. I kind of lost touch with him after Nancy got sick.
c17374 +++$+++ What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
c18657 +++$+++ It's late....
c18657 +++$+++ Trying to write our report....
c18657 +++$+++ I'm fine....
c08259 +++$+++ I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
c08259 +++$+++ I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
c08259 +++$+++ A gay lot --- Redi, for instance.  I don't know what her sorrow is,	but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...
c24076 +++$+++ Help me here...
c24076 +++$+++ Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
c24076 +++$+++ No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
c21622 +++$+++ I have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
c21622 +++$+++ Go live in a tent.
c21622 +++$+++ Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
c01609 +++$+++ That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?
c01609 +++$+++ Well.
c01609 +++$+++ THEN WHAT?
c01609 +++$+++ Then you got undressed.
c01609 +++$+++ How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
c01609 +++$+++ Never before this.
c01609 +++$+++ How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
c01609 +++$+++ No. Come on.
c01609 +++$+++ NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
c01609 +++$+++ No way.
c23829 +++$+++ ... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
c23829 +++$+++ What's the message?
c23829 +++$+++ How do you mean, strange?
c13656 +++$+++ Back in a minute, Jody
c13656 +++$+++ You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
c13656 +++$+++ Yes.
c13656 +++$+++ And do you know why?
c13656 +++$+++ Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
c05607 +++$+++ Bob Larson.  Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
c05607 +++$+++ A violation?
c05607 +++$+++ Oh, yes.
c05607 +++$+++ And if I enclosed it?
c05607 +++$+++ An exhaust system or a window is code.
c05607 +++$+++ Allowed outside the enclosed area.
c20998 +++$+++ I just want to say to Tony -- don't take it personally.  The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
c20998 +++$+++ ... get fired.
c20998 +++$+++ Yes, they're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  I was total crap.
c09500 +++$+++ What?
c09500 +++$+++ You can be a leech -- you know this -- and it's boring. You can be quite boring.
c09500 +++$+++ The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
c09500 +++$+++ Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?
c20335 +++$+++ Hello.
c20335 +++$+++ 'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
c20335 +++$+++ I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
c20335 +++$+++ This is the castle of of my master, Guy de Loimbard.
c20335 +++$+++ Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
c20335 +++$+++ What?
c03916 +++$+++ You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
c03916 +++$+++ Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
c03916 +++$+++ What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
c03916 +++$+++ "Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
c03916 +++$+++ Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
c03916 +++$+++ Oh, I'll bet you have.
c27225 +++$+++ Good morning.
c27225 +++$+++ You didn't have to...
c27225 +++$+++ Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
c16454 +++$+++ Seems like I'm always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, doesn't it?
c16454 +++$+++ Am I out of here?
c16454 +++$+++ That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
c16454 +++$+++ Hard to believe.  You shoot up one little town in Oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken.  No sense of humor.  What did you expect?  An engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?
c24710 +++$+++ Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor. How did that happen to a non-Party member?
c24710 +++$+++ I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor. I was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. After the dreadful events of November 1938, the violent attacks on the Jews, I stopped using the title.
c24710 +++$+++ What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, you used that title didn't you? But then I suppose you had no choice there either, because I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, Dear Mr. Vice-President.
c24710 +++$+++ I don't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram. I was simply told. In a letter, I believe. I don't remember exactly.
c24710 +++$+++ Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
c01828 +++$+++ We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
c01828 +++$+++ Are we hacking or asking?
c01828 +++$+++ And what about you, anything?
c22179 +++$+++ Fifty years, huh.
c22179 +++$+++ Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
c22179 +++$+++ How 'bout a glass of water?
c22179 +++$+++ Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
c22179 +++$+++ ...What?
c22179 +++$+++ Ya got a good mind for dates.
c06291 +++$+++ Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
c06291 +++$+++ Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
c06291 +++$+++ They missed the boat.
c06291 +++$+++ Glad to help.
c21564 +++$+++ Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.
c21564 +++$+++ How careful should I be?
c21564 +++$+++ Maybe you're going to have to like me.
c08389 +++$+++ Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
c08389 +++$+++ I can't help the traffic.
c08389 +++$+++ Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
c00291 +++$+++ You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
c00291 +++$+++ Stop talking.
c00291 +++$+++ You got absolute zero.
c00291 +++$+++ Show me where you buried her.
c00291 +++$+++ I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
c00291 +++$+++ I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
c20297 +++$+++ Will you live here?
c20297 +++$+++ No.
c20297 +++$+++ Pop don't like Johnny.
c09002 +++$+++ My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
c09002 +++$+++ All right. Let's take it from the top.
c09002 +++$+++ The top of what?
c09002 +++$+++ Name?
c09002 +++$+++ My name?
c09002 +++$+++ No, <u>my</u> name.
c09002 +++$+++ I do not know your name.
c09002 +++$+++ I am? May I go now?
c24150 +++$+++ Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
c24150 +++$+++ Yeah, sure.
c24150 +++$+++ Maybe she has caller ID.
c08161 +++$+++ Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
c08161 +++$+++ Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
c08161 +++$+++ Wife?!
c17886 +++$+++ Hello!
c17886 +++$+++ Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
c17886 +++$+++ Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
c16326 +++$+++ Get your hands off him!  Get off...! What the hell do you think you're doing... ? Evidence?!  This is a man... !  You killed him!
c16326 +++$+++ He was killed in action.
c16326 +++$+++ He was killed serving Project Mayhem.
c01572 +++$+++ How long will we have to stay down here?
c01572 +++$+++ I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
c01572 +++$+++ Days??
c01572 +++$+++ Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
c01572 +++$+++ But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
c01572 +++$+++ I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
c01572 +++$+++ Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
c01572 +++$+++ As long as we've got that straight.
c04919 +++$+++ Does something else worry you?
c04919 +++$+++ I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
c04919 +++$+++ Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
c27058 +++$+++ What happened?
c27058 +++$+++ I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
c27058 +++$+++ Is LESLIE here?
c27058 +++$+++ He saved my life you know - has he told you...
c11081 +++$+++ So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
c11081 +++$+++ Why should you think I wouldn't be?
c11081 +++$+++ Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
c11081 +++$+++ I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
c11081 +++$+++ Not at all.
c11081 +++$+++ I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
c11081 +++$+++ To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
c11081 +++$+++ You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
c11081 +++$+++ Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
c11081 +++$+++ He's the best.
c11081 +++$+++ He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
c11081 +++$+++ Oh, no. I see the play.
c11081 +++$+++ Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
c04464 +++$+++ Oh, Sallah! What a relief!
c04464 +++$+++ Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
c04464 +++$+++ You are on your own?
c22191 +++$+++ Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
c22191 +++$+++ Maybe ya should see a doctor.
c22191 +++$+++ I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
c22191 +++$+++ Maybe another job is the best thing.
c22191 +++$+++ Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
c22191 +++$+++ Gazzo's gotta come to you.
c22191 +++$+++ Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
c19222 +++$+++ I think I would rather just turn them over.
c19222 +++$+++ I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
c19222 +++$+++ No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
c00396 +++$+++ Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
c00396 +++$+++ You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
c00396 +++$+++ Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
c08656 +++$+++ You know this guy, don't you?
c08656 +++$+++ I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
c08656 +++$+++ By stealing my car?
c08656 +++$+++ I would've come back for you.
c08656 +++$+++ Yeah.
c05470 +++$+++ You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
c05470 +++$+++ I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
c05470 +++$+++ That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
c05275 +++$+++ Yep.
c05275 +++$+++ Holy shit. That's all true?
c05275 +++$+++ No. I was just kidding.
c05275 +++$+++ I lied. His dad is still alive. He works for the post office.
c10235 +++$+++ How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
c10235 +++$+++ Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
c10235 +++$+++ You think I shouldn't fly.
c10235 +++$+++ I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
c10235 +++$+++ I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
c03284 +++$+++ -build the bridge over the Tsavo river. And be finished in four months time. Can you do that?
c03284 +++$+++ I'm sure you've examined my record. So you know I've never yet been late on a bridge.
c03284 +++$+++ You've never built in Africa.
c03284 +++$+++ But I have in India- every country presents problems.
c03284 +++$+++ You'll need your confidence, I promise you.
c03284 +++$+++ I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
c03284 +++$+++ You won't have the chance.  Any further words of encouragement?  Then I've a train to catch.
c13395 +++$+++ We need this guy.
c13395 +++$+++ We can't get rid of him?
c13395 +++$+++ I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.
c12437 +++$+++ Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
c12437 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c12437 +++$+++ Her life is in your hands.
c12437 +++$+++ Oh, man, don't say that..
c12437 +++$+++ Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
c12437 +++$+++ Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.
c20122 +++$+++ A mistake.
c20122 +++$+++ "Mistake"?  What's that supposed to...?
c20122 +++$+++ How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
c10224 +++$+++ I guess I owe you one.
c10224 +++$+++ You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
c10224 +++$+++ You saved our lives. You did it!
c10224 +++$+++ We did it.
c10224 +++$+++ No. You can be mine!
c22400 +++$+++ Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
c22400 +++$+++ What?
c22400 +++$+++ She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
c22400 +++$+++ No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired...
c26580 +++$+++ Are you out of your mind...?
c26580 +++$+++ ...I'm going to need your help...
c26580 +++$+++ You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
c26580 +++$+++ I'm going to help her.
c26580 +++$+++ To do what...?  To do what, for chrissake...?   To help her to do what?  She's dead...
c26580 +++$+++ That's the point, you stupid fuck. Let them buy it.  We let them buy the case.  That's what I took it for.  You let this drop -- we'll go up to New Hampshire, kill some fuckin' deer...
c07022 +++$+++ I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
c07022 +++$+++ A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
c07022 +++$+++ Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
c07022 +++$+++ Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
c12889 +++$+++ Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
c12889 +++$+++ Yes. And I've accepted.
c12889 +++$+++ What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
c12889 +++$+++ I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
c12889 +++$+++ I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
c12209 +++$+++ Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
c12209 +++$+++ Just make sure it looks like an accident...
c12209 +++$+++ Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
c01250 +++$+++ Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
c01250 +++$+++ Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
c01250 +++$+++ I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
c01250 +++$+++ Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
c01250 +++$+++ I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
c24797 +++$+++ Really?
c24797 +++$+++ Yeah.
c24797 +++$+++ Split it?
c24797 +++$+++ Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
c24797 +++$+++ Where's Christine?  The waitress.
c24797 +++$+++ Did she?
c04566 +++$+++ What happened?
c04566 +++$+++ Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
c04566 +++$+++ In him?
c04566 +++$+++ ya hyutn slulptsa?
c12524 +++$+++ What are you looking at?
c12524 +++$+++ What do you see here?
c12524 +++$+++ Look closer.
c02219 +++$+++ Not right now.
c02219 +++$+++ Not right now?  Okay, when?
c02219 +++$+++ Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
c02219 +++$+++ Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
c02219 +++$+++ Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
c02219 +++$+++ You're gonna pay me fifty thousand dollars...
c11083 +++$+++ There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
c11083 +++$+++ But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
c11083 +++$+++ Eve. Eve Harrington.
c13262 +++$+++ Buffy?  What's wrong?
c13262 +++$+++ Oh, God.  It's him.  I think it's him.
c13262 +++$+++ Merrick...
c24397 +++$+++ How come?
c24397 +++$+++ The doctor suggested it.
c24397 +++$+++ What doctor?
c24397 +++$+++ Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts.
c24397 +++$+++ Uh-huh?
c24397 +++$+++ We have to be very careful.  No sleeping pills, no razor blades. We shut off the gas in her bed- room.
c24397 +++$+++ Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
c24397 +++$+++ I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
c24397 +++$+++ You send them.  Is that it, Max?
c24397 +++$+++ I'd better press your evening clothes, sir.  You have not for- gotten Madame's New Year's party.
c24397 +++$+++ I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
c04609 +++$+++ He's into kind of little cars, that...
c04609 +++$+++ That remote control thing?
c04609 +++$+++ Yeah.
c04609 +++$+++ Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
c04609 +++$+++ Mom.
c04609 +++$+++ There's Dad, on TV.
c22645 +++$+++ That's because he doesn't have one.
c22645 +++$+++ Whata you mean?  He told me -
c22645 +++$+++ Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
c22645 +++$+++ That's probably what he would have done if we hadn't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
c13068 +++$+++ Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
c13068 +++$+++ I delivered it.
c13068 +++$+++ Yes.
c03892 +++$+++ I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
c03892 +++$+++ Does that worry you?
c03892 +++$+++ Yes. It does.
c03892 +++$+++ Why?
c03892 +++$+++ I put a lot of effort into these things.
c03892 +++$+++ Ah, yes.
c03892 +++$+++ And a lot of time.
c03892 +++$+++ I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
c03892 +++$+++ No.
c03892 +++$+++ What about the draft?
c03892 +++$+++ My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
c03892 +++$+++ Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
c03892 +++$+++ Yes. What kind of things do you do?
c25003 +++$+++ Who were you talking to?!
c25003 +++$+++ You're the one talking to the walls!
c25003 +++$+++ Truman, stop it!
c02656 +++$+++ Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.
c02656 +++$+++ I thought he was out of town.
c02656 +++$+++ Then don't hassle it.
c08206 +++$+++ I know it's hard but we need the exact words.
c08206 +++$+++ Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
c08206 +++$+++ GODDAMN YOU!
c27026 +++$+++ My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
c27026 +++$+++ And whose houses do you design...?
c27026 +++$+++ You still feel that crazy...?
c01736 +++$+++ I think I may have found a way out of here.
c01736 +++$+++ You're kidding.
c01736 +++$+++ No. I'm not.
c01736 +++$+++ How?
c01736 +++$+++ Dignan, I --
c15916 +++$+++ How? Where?
c15916 +++$+++ In the great book.
c15916 +++$+++ What book is that?
c15916 +++$+++ The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
c15916 +++$+++ The dragon! There...
c22624 +++$+++ Nice day
c22624 +++$+++ I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
c22624 +++$+++ Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.
c22624 +++$+++ Why's that?
c22624 +++$+++ My features. They're Finnish.
c22624 +++$+++ You don't say.
c22624 +++$+++ Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.
c18070 +++$+++ You mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
c18070 +++$+++ I overheard him with the girl.
c18070 +++$+++ <u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
c18070 +++$+++ Jesus, get upstairs and find out!  If he took those kids, we're fucked!
c15913 +++$+++ Merlin, will I live...?  ...I was dreaming...
c15913 +++$+++ Of Merlin?
c15913 +++$+++ I dreamed of him too... Merlin lives! He lives in our dreams now, in that dark and shadowy place that is as strong and real as this more solid one. He speaks to us from there.
c12415 +++$+++ Yes?
c12415 +++$+++ May I come in?
c12415 +++$+++ What you want?
c12415 +++$+++ I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
c12415 +++$+++ Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
c12415 +++$+++ Oh.
c12415 +++$+++ What you want'em for?
c12415 +++$+++ I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
c12415 +++$+++ You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
c12415 +++$+++ Yes ma'am.
c12415 +++$+++ I heard your mother took sick, that so?
c12415 +++$+++ Well, come on in. You letting in flies.
c03651 +++$+++ Why am I here?
c03651 +++$+++ They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
c03651 +++$+++ With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
c03651 +++$+++ Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
c03651 +++$+++ Well, when you put it that way.
c03651 +++$+++ I like a woman who takes control.
c05613 +++$+++ Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
c05613 +++$+++ I hate this job.
c05613 +++$+++ From the day I started...to today.  Can't stand it.
c15420 +++$+++ Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
c15420 +++$+++ Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
c15420 +++$+++ Hey, he cheated on her.
c15420 +++$+++ He made a mistake.
c15420 +++$+++ I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
c15420 +++$+++ No! And that girl has a name.
c13569 +++$+++ Any idea where you're going?
c13569 +++$+++ I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
c13569 +++$+++ They did some great job of reforming you.
c13569 +++$+++ That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
c13569 +++$+++ I had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "Her," I could've painted.  <u>You</u>, I'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
c03884 +++$+++ Supper for two.
c03884 +++$+++ Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
c03884 +++$+++ It's all right. It's organic.
c03884 +++$+++ For you.
c14560 +++$+++ Today's your lucky day, Sami.
c14560 +++$+++ Yeah, I can see that.
c14560 +++$+++ Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
c14560 +++$+++ Me?
c14560 +++$+++ I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
c09073 +++$+++ Both.  I think I'm having a mid-life crisis...
c09073 +++$+++ ... I believe you...
c09073 +++$+++ ... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
c21668 +++$+++ She's never written a book in it, but she clearly knew a lot.
c21668 +++$+++ Mmm...
c21668 +++$+++ It's obvious what you have to do. Your way into the daughter's pants is through the mother, up the Suez canal...
c21668 +++$+++ You're so gross.
c21668 +++$+++ She's very nice, apparently.  Lives in Norfolk.  And very left-wing. You'll have to watch yourself there.
c21668 +++$+++ Ha ha...
c21668 +++$+++ According to this, the daughter goes up to stay quiet often.  You'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend.
c21668 +++$+++ No need to thank me, if you don't want to.  Just pay for these drinks.
c03362 +++$+++ You're very handy, I can tell.  I bet you like to read a lot, too.
c03362 +++$+++ Print is dead.
c03362 +++$+++ That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
c03362 +++$+++ Is that a game?
c03362 +++$+++ It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
c03362 +++$+++ I collect spores, molds and fungus.
c03362 +++$+++ Oh, that's very - unusual.
c03362 +++$+++ Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
c06134 +++$+++ Can I ask you something?
c06134 +++$+++ Sure, man.
c06134 +++$+++ Are you Elijah's pimp?
c06134 +++$+++ What?
c06134 +++$+++ "His greatest greatness."
c06134 +++$+++ If you don't know, man, then I feel sorriest for you.
c08786 +++$+++ Mike?
c08786 +++$+++ What?
c08786 +++$+++ My ass if falling.
c08786 +++$+++ Your what...?
c08786 +++$+++ My ass is falling.  It is.
c08786 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c08786 +++$+++ I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
c08786 +++$+++ Get in bed.
c08786 +++$+++ You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
c11096 +++$+++ I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
c11096 +++$+++ You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
c11096 +++$+++ I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
c11096 +++$+++ Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
c11096 +++$+++ When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
c09368 +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
c09368 +++$+++ I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
c09368 +++$+++ You haven't told then, huh?
c09368 +++$+++ I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking...
c26834 +++$+++ What's on your mind?
c26834 +++$+++ I have a question for you.
c26834 +++$+++ Ask it.
c26834 +++$+++ Why do people go to war?
c26834 +++$+++ Why do people go to war?
c26834 +++$+++ I'll play your silly game.
c26834 +++$+++ Why do they go to War?
c26834 +++$+++ To preserve their Way of Life.
c26834 +++$+++ Would you go to War to do that?
c26834 +++$+++ Well, I have, too.  Would you do it <u>again</u>...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess <u>so</u>.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and <u>Togo</u>? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>over</u>.  The War of the Future is <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah. And to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>.  You have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, <u>this</u>  is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there <u>ain't</u> no war but ours.
c15457 +++$+++ Why me?
c15457 +++$+++ You brought the cameras here!
c15457 +++$+++ You brought the girl!
c15457 +++$+++ If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too.
c11942 +++$+++ Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.
c11942 +++$+++ But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
c11942 +++$+++ Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
c11942 +++$+++ Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture. What do you need, a road map?
c23794 +++$+++ You told Junior that we did it.
c23794 +++$+++ It?
c23794 +++$+++ It. Bouncy-bouncy. Fucked. He tried to squeeze my fucking head off. What did you say to him? When they reach each other, they stop. Sheila seems to weigh her answer.
c23794 +++$+++ I told him you were my boyfriend.
c23794 +++$+++ What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
c23794 +++$+++ We would have sooner or later.
c23794 +++$+++ Did you - kill him?
c13599 +++$+++ He's still looking, Col.
c13599 +++$+++ Persistent.
c13599 +++$+++ Good thing in a man.
c13599 +++$+++ An excellent quality.
c13599 +++$+++ I would expect he does.
c22172 +++$+++ Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
c22172 +++$+++ Why?
c22172 +++$+++ 'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
c22172 +++$+++ C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
c22172 +++$+++ That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
c22172 +++$+++ Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.
c00338 +++$+++ So what's up?  What'd I miss?
c00338 +++$+++ She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
c00338 +++$+++ So?
c00338 +++$+++ It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
c00338 +++$+++ Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
c10255 +++$+++ Harry, what the hell is this?
c10255 +++$+++ Come on, let's go have that drink.
c10255 +++$+++ What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
c10255 +++$+++ Are you crazy?!  I don't know anything about Mars.
c24562 +++$+++ They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
c24562 +++$+++ Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
c24562 +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Luthor...
c10397 +++$+++ ...he wants to testify...?
c10397 +++$+++ It looks that way.
c10397 +++$+++ You know what that would mean?
c10397 +++$+++ ...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.
c17812 +++$+++ Hello....?
c17812 +++$+++ ...what did you want?
c17812 +++$+++ I know where he is.
c17812 +++$+++ I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
c17812 +++$+++ I know where he is.
c17812 +++$+++ And why should we believe you?
c17812 +++$+++ I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar.
c17812 +++$+++ What shape is the scar?
c17812 +++$+++ I want the money.
c17812 +++$+++ The shape of a Three.
c10602 +++$+++ The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
c10602 +++$+++ Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
c10602 +++$+++ I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
c10602 +++$+++ I know, peanut. But it wasn't all like you were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset. My bein' there was upsettin' to you. You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess you'd got married and your husband was comin' home any minute.
c21469 +++$+++ Not when I was in the Navy.
c21469 +++$+++ So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal <u>instincts</u>... Anything going on?
c21469 +++$+++ Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
c02824 +++$+++ You're an outcast.
c02824 +++$+++ Yes. I have been seeking my friends.
c02824 +++$+++ Friends? Do they live around here?
c02824 +++$+++ Why do you not go to them?
c09708 +++$+++ Melanie, Melanie...
c09708 +++$+++ I'm frightened, Mitch.
c09708 +++$+++ No, no...
c09708 +++$+++ I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
c09708 +++$+++ ...everything I know.
c06950 +++$+++ I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
c06950 +++$+++ Nan, I --
c06950 +++$+++ Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
c06950 +++$+++ Fred Krueger did it, Daddy, and only I can get him. It's my nightmare he comes to.
c05233 +++$+++ You wanna go to Paul's house?
c05233 +++$+++ What for? That guys a dick.
c05233 +++$+++ I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
c05233 +++$+++ You think he's got any herb?
c05233 +++$+++ I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
c05233 +++$+++ You think?
c05233 +++$+++ Probably.
c05233 +++$+++ He lives on 76th?
c05233 +++$+++ Den less go Joe.
c13883 +++$+++ Hello.
c13883 +++$+++ Have you got your checkbook handy, Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.
c13883 +++$+++ You've got her? Where?
c13883 +++$+++ Do you remember the figures we discussed?
c13883 +++$+++ Of course I do. Where are you?
c13883 +++$+++ At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
c13883 +++$+++ Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
c13883 +++$+++ Either that or she'll be in jail.
c13883 +++$+++ Just bring your checkbook.
c05765 +++$+++ I couldn't get you out of my mind.
c05765 +++$+++ I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
c05765 +++$+++ Maybe... sure...
c05765 +++$+++ Thanks... but I have the choice.
c05765 +++$+++ Then it's still no.
c25358 +++$+++ My king will pay any ransom you ask.
c25358 +++$+++ Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
c25358 +++$+++ And God who allowed you to be caught?
c04552 +++$+++ They're all in it.
c04552 +++$+++ How do you know?
c04552 +++$+++ Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
c15478 +++$+++ Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
c15478 +++$+++ I know.
c15478 +++$+++ Ethics are...
c06764 +++$+++ Yes!
c06764 +++$+++ Doctor Heller?
c06764 +++$+++ Yes!
c06764 +++$+++ It's me... Elizabeth.
c06764 +++$+++ Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
c06764 +++$+++ Thanks.
c06764 +++$+++ How's your dad?
c06764 +++$+++ Oh that's right -- they squished him... Heck of a guy.
c25365 +++$+++ Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
c25365 +++$+++ He's feeling wonderful.
c25365 +++$+++ Thanks be to God.
c25365 +++$+++ And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
c25365 +++$+++ Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
c25365 +++$+++ Buying her?
c25365 +++$+++ I understand.  How much?
c20054 +++$+++ What's our deal?
c20054 +++$+++ Backup in case the Russians get physical.
c20054 +++$+++ Skin has to touch skin.  That's the requirement for the warrant.  Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops....  Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security...
c25979 +++$+++ You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
c25979 +++$+++ Barbara --
c25979 +++$+++ Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
c25979 +++$+++ The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
c25979 +++$+++ If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
c25979 +++$+++ Look, I'm as worried as you are --
c25979 +++$+++ Yeah, well, she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar, too.
c21687 +++$+++ Don't screw around man, pull it!
c21687 +++$+++ You do it... you first!
c21687 +++$+++ One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
c21687 +++$+++ Okay!
c22938 +++$+++ How was it?
c22938 +++$+++ I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
c22938 +++$+++ Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
c26740 +++$+++ We don't think so. I mean, we just want the singing when I come out.
c26740 +++$+++ Okay great. What will that be?
c26740 +++$+++ We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
c26740 +++$+++ What song?
c26740 +++$+++ "You Send Me."
c26740 +++$+++ You know,  Darling you...you send me...Darling you ...You mend me.  Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.
c22357 +++$+++ Hey where's the hot pad?
c22357 +++$+++ What?
c22357 +++$+++ Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
c22357 +++$+++ Forget it.
c15103 +++$+++ Money -- money's a funny thing, ain't it, Ma?
c15103 +++$+++ I figure that depends a mite on how you get it and how you spend it, Son.
c15103 +++$+++ Do you really think that?
c15103 +++$+++ Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
c15103 +++$+++ Wouldn't profit him none.
c08615 +++$+++ Gene.
c08615 +++$+++ Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
c08615 +++$+++ You're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
c08615 +++$+++ Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
c08615 +++$+++ Book of Jeremiah.
c25615 +++$+++ Epps?
c25615 +++$+++ What?
c25615 +++$+++ I'm thinking about taking a trip.
c25615 +++$+++ Thought you were going to buy a car.
c25615 +++$+++ Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
c25615 +++$+++ I don't know.
c25615 +++$+++ How the hell should I know?
c22174 +++$+++ I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
c22174 +++$+++ Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
c22174 +++$+++ ...What?
c22174 +++$+++ I said, how ya feelin'?
c22174 +++$+++ Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
c22174 +++$+++ Yeah.
c22174 +++$+++ Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
c22174 +++$+++ Dipper needed it.
c06995 +++$+++ What do we do now?
c06995 +++$+++ We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
c06995 +++$+++ Is that customary?
c06995 +++$+++ It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
c06995 +++$+++ I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
c06995 +++$+++ Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
c06995 +++$+++ I will start with you.
c06995 +++$+++ That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
c06995 +++$+++ And what is your profession?
c06995 +++$+++ Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
c06995 +++$+++ And what do you do for mankind?
c06995 +++$+++ For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
c06995 +++$+++ You are something we do not have in Russia.
c06995 +++$+++ Thank you. Thank you.
c06995 +++$+++ That is why I believe in the future of my country.
c06995 +++$+++ I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
c06995 +++$+++ You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
c06995 +++$+++ Ni-notchka.
c06995 +++$+++ That is correct.
c06995 +++$+++ Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
c06995 +++$+++ Your general appearance is not distasteful.
c06995 +++$+++ Thank you.
c06995 +++$+++ Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
c06995 +++$+++ Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
c06995 +++$+++ You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
c06995 +++$+++ Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
c06995 +++$+++ I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
c06995 +++$+++ What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
c06995 +++$+++ You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
c06995 +++$+++ You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
c06995 +++$+++ You repeat yourself.
c06995 +++$+++ I'd like to say it a thousand times.
c06995 +++$+++ Don't do it, please.
c06995 +++$+++ I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
c06995 +++$+++ It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
c06995 +++$+++ The bayonet? Did you really?
c06995 +++$+++ I was wounded before Warsaw.
c06995 +++$+++ Wounded? How?
c06995 +++$+++ I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
c06995 +++$+++ I'd love to.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
c06995 +++$+++ A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
c06995 +++$+++ Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all, I'm alive.
c08306 +++$+++ Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
c08306 +++$+++ Radon leakage?
c08306 +++$+++ Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
c08306 +++$+++ No, I haven't.
c08306 +++$+++ Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
c08306 +++$+++ Did you confront John about the visitor?
c08306 +++$+++ What visitor?
c08306 +++$+++ The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
c08306 +++$+++ Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
c08306 +++$+++ Is he still at your house?
c08306 +++$+++ No, he left last week.
c08306 +++$+++ Did you find him attractive?
c08306 +++$+++ What do you mean, like physically?
c08306 +++$+++ I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him.  After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.
c13664 +++$+++ What's that?
c13664 +++$+++ Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
c13664 +++$+++ No?
c13664 +++$+++ Nope. Not handsome at all.
c13664 +++$+++ You trying to hurt my feelings?
c13664 +++$+++ No. It's the truth.
c13664 +++$+++ Well, I could say the same about you.
c13664 +++$+++ Could you?
c13664 +++$+++ So I've noticed.
c08214 +++$+++ Mrs. Sutphin, I'm Paul Stubbins, Chip's math teacher.
c08214 +++$+++ Nice to meet you, Mr. Stubbins.  A little something I baked.
c08214 +++$+++ Bon Appetit!
c23327 +++$+++ You and I know that life is not so simple.  There will be disappointments. Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished. How... fortunate.
c23327 +++$+++ Okay, so I just got things started.  But you could build on that.  You could keep it going.
c23327 +++$+++ I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, Mary Clarence.
c23327 +++$+++ Good day.
c11970 +++$+++ ...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
c11970 +++$+++ Excellent picture.
c11970 +++$+++ We got a treatment on it yet?
c11970 +++$+++ Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. And a romantic interest. You know the drill.  Romantic interest, or else a young kid. An orphan. What do you think, Lou? Wally a little too old for a romantic interest?  Look at me, a writer in the room and I'm askin' Lou what the goddamn story should be!
c26538 +++$+++ That's the call that I'm waiting for.
c26538 +++$+++ What does it mean?
c26538 +++$+++ Does that mean I'm back for awhile?
c01929 +++$+++ And I congratulate you.
c01929 +++$+++ What for?
c01929 +++$+++ Your work.
c01929 +++$+++ We all try. You succeed.
c05417 +++$+++ How many girlfriends did you have?
c05417 +++$+++ ...I don't know.
c05417 +++$+++ Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
c05417 +++$+++ ...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
c05417 +++$+++ Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
c07895 +++$+++ Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
c07895 +++$+++ Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
c07895 +++$+++ He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
c01968 +++$+++ One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
c01968 +++$+++ For how long?
c01968 +++$+++ Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
c01968 +++$+++ Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
c11254 +++$+++ Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
c11254 +++$+++ I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
c11254 +++$+++ I told you. These murders are not normal.
c05529 +++$+++ What was that?  Did you hear that?
c05529 +++$+++ It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
c05529 +++$+++ It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
c05529 +++$+++ From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
c05529 +++$+++ Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
c18132 +++$+++ Where are we going, sir?
c18132 +++$+++ For supplies, you drive.
c18132 +++$+++ Just drive, Gregoire.
c04882 +++$+++ I don't... I can't believe it.  They killed him because he wanted to change things.  In our time - in our country?
c04882 +++$+++ Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me.  Don't trust me.  Do your own work, your own thinking.
c04882 +++$+++ The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
c04882 +++$+++ No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
c04882 +++$+++ But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
c18227 +++$+++ But you gave me a rose ...
c18227 +++$+++ And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
c18227 +++$+++ You shit.  Who do you think you are?
c18227 +++$+++ I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
c18227 +++$+++ Right.  Like you were hog-tied or something.
c21606 +++$+++ All right, let's see the buzzer.
c21606 +++$+++ What's a buzzer?
c21606 +++$+++ So you're not a cop.
c21606 +++$+++ Me a cop? What made you think that, Mr. Brandon?
c21606 +++$+++ I've got good ears.
c27029 +++$+++ Hello...?
c27029 +++$+++ Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
c27029 +++$+++ Rowan...?
c27029 +++$+++ What's wrong..?
c01641 +++$+++ Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
c01641 +++$+++ I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
c01641 +++$+++ Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
c01641 +++$+++ My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
c01641 +++$+++ You really do hear a lot, don't you?
c01641 +++$+++ Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
c01641 +++$+++ I have to help out in my father's hardware store. They're giving me sort of my own hours for a while, which is nice.
c01641 +++$+++ It's not bad, but it's bad enough. It's a lot worse for my father.  I used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
c21042 +++$+++ That's okay, kid...
c21042 +++$+++ Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
c21042 +++$+++ No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
c21042 +++$+++ O-o-o-oh...
c21042 +++$+++ 'K-k-kay, Mack!
c06071 +++$+++ Cardiff Giant?
c06071 +++$+++ What?
c06071 +++$+++ Cardiff Giant. Just check.
c06071 +++$+++ Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
c06071 +++$+++ Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
c06667 +++$+++ Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
c06667 +++$+++ Looking for?
c06667 +++$+++ You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
c06667 +++$+++ Very good, sir.  Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram came for you, sir.  I'll get you some black coffee, sir.
c13544 +++$+++ No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
c13544 +++$+++ I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
c13544 +++$+++ Shit!
c08247 +++$+++ I had begun to write again ---that's whet I was doing when you came in.
c08247 +++$+++ It's because of Jacqueline ---- I can't go on looking for her --
c08247 +++$+++ You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
c08247 +++$+++ Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
c08247 +++$+++ I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said --- it fits in with what I saw --- she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
c04967 +++$+++ I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
c04967 +++$+++ What the hell you talkin' bout?
c04967 +++$+++ Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
c04967 +++$+++ How do you know she did that?
c04967 +++$+++ I was there, I saw her do it.
c04967 +++$+++ Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
c04967 +++$+++ I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
c04967 +++$+++ Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
c03943 +++$+++ The box... you opened it. We came.
c03943 +++$+++ It's just a puzzle box.
c03943 +++$+++ It's a means to summon us -- it's called the Lament Configuration.
c03943 +++$+++ Who are you?
c03943 +++$+++ Well, I didn't mean to open that thing. You can go back wherever you came from.
c05103 +++$+++ Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.
c05103 +++$+++ What?!!
c05103 +++$+++ But?!!
c03062 +++$+++ George, you know I only love you, but...
c03062 +++$+++ But not more than your comfort.
c03062 +++$+++ And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
c03062 +++$+++ That's a lie!
c03062 +++$+++ Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
c03062 +++$+++ Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
c03062 +++$+++ I'd throw everything away for you.
c11172 +++$+++ Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
c11172 +++$+++ Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
c11172 +++$+++ Talk about Segretti--
c11172 +++$+++ --don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
c11172 +++$+++ There were more then.
c11172 +++$+++ Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
c11172 +++$+++ --the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
c11172 +++$+++ --don't you miss the grand scheme too.
c11172 +++$+++ How grand?
c11172 +++$+++ Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
c11172 +++$+++ And Justice and FBI know all this?
c11172 +++$+++ Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
c11172 +++$+++ I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
c08235 +++$+++ This is about another murder ---- a woman at Fifty Second Street
c08235 +++$+++ But you do believe me?
c08235 +++$+++ I saw him on the floor. He was cut ---  --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him ---- white ---- and the men holding him up between them.
c10846 +++$+++ As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
c10846 +++$+++ Is that possible?
c10846 +++$+++ Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
c10846 +++$+++ Is that far from here?
c10846 +++$+++ About fifty miles or so. If you want, I'll give you the name of the storekeeper.
c10846 +++$+++ Yes... of course... But you should also print that in your paper... But right away, tomorrow morning... It's the local Palermo paper, isn't it?... I mean, it's widely read...
c10846 +++$+++ Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
c10846 +++$+++ You really must do me this one favor.
c10846 +++$+++ Then let's call it a business proposition. Something to round out your salary.
c09931 +++$+++ You ok?
c09931 +++$+++ I'm fine.
c09931 +++$+++ [Beat] Listen, I hate to bother you...
c09931 +++$+++ Then don't.
c09931 +++$+++ But... what about Starks?
c09931 +++$+++ What about Starks?
c09931 +++$+++ Should we be...
c09931 +++$+++ But the Jacket? I mean...should we be leaving him in like that?
c17369 +++$+++ Yeah. Do you paint?
c17369 +++$+++ No.
c17369 +++$+++ Crayons?
c17369 +++$+++ This is a real piece of shit.
c17369 +++$+++ Tell me what you really think.
c17369 +++$+++ Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
c17369 +++$+++ What does?
c17369 +++$+++ The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
c17369 +++$+++ What is?
c17369 +++$+++ I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
c17369 +++$+++ Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
c17369 +++$+++ You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
c17369 +++$+++ Sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
c17369 +++$+++ Maybe what mea--
c04475 +++$+++ This.
c04475 +++$+++ The Grail Diary.
c04475 +++$+++ You had it? You didn't trust me!
c20404 +++$+++ What are those?
c20404 +++$+++ What?
c20404 +++$+++ Those, over there, there.
c20404 +++$+++ Craobhan-geanmchno...  How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
c03031 +++$+++ There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
c03031 +++$+++ That can't be.
c03031 +++$+++ There's this whispering campaign against me ever since Gates won at Saratoga.
c03031 +++$+++ Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
c03031 +++$+++ There, then, you can have sort of a normal life.
c03549 +++$+++ The war.
c03549 +++$+++ That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
c03549 +++$+++ Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
c03549 +++$+++ Yes, I was in the war.
c23211 +++$+++ Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
c23211 +++$+++ A soap?
c23211 +++$+++ A daytime soap opera.
c23211 +++$+++ And?
c23211 +++$+++ I was too old.
c23211 +++$+++ Somebody's mother.
c01145 +++$+++ You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
c01145 +++$+++ I didn't mean to scare you like that.
c01145 +++$+++ Well you did.
c01145 +++$+++ Give me some?
c01145 +++$+++ I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
c01145 +++$+++ Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
c01145 +++$+++ BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
c00055 +++$+++ Wait I...
c00055 +++$+++ You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
c00055 +++$+++ It wasn't like that.
c00055 +++$+++ I didn't care about the money.
c23248 +++$+++ Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
c23248 +++$+++ No.
c23248 +++$+++ Yes.
c19366 +++$+++ My God.
c19366 +++$+++ What?
c19366 +++$+++ You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
c19366 +++$+++ Yeah.  You could say that.
c19366 +++$+++ You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
c19366 +++$+++ You can't change it.  You have to walk...  ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it.
c16183 +++$+++ The trek out to the hospital every day didn't help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
c16183 +++$+++ You had a heart attack?
c16183 +++$+++ That's why I work for Big Ed?
c14908 +++$+++ Hey, Tricks. Some detail they got you on.
c14908 +++$+++ Not as bad as yours, pal.
c14908 +++$+++ What'dya get?
c14908 +++$+++ We need fuel, and a couple automatics.
c03380 +++$+++ I told you it's real.
c03380 +++$+++ What do we do now?
c03380 +++$+++ I don't know.  Talk to it.
c03380 +++$+++ What do I say?
c03380 +++$+++ Anything!  Just make contact.
c03380 +++$+++ Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
c04811 +++$+++ The old man's screwy!
c04811 +++$+++ What's 'at?
c04811 +++$+++ I said, the old man's screwy!
c04811 +++$+++ Yeah!
c04811 +++$+++ How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
c12488 +++$+++ They're nihilists.
c12488 +++$+++ Huh?
c12488 +++$+++ Nihilists!  Jesus.
c13856 +++$+++ Yeah?
c13856 +++$+++ Be sure you feed Bosco.
c13856 +++$+++ And don't give him any ice cream...
c13856 +++$+++ ...like April.  It gives him gas. And make sure there's  two pots of coffee...
c13856 +++$+++ Two pots of coffee...
c13856 +++$+++ ...ready before the morning crowd blows in.  I got it...
c21085 +++$+++ She was your sister.
c21085 +++$+++ No, she wasn't my sister.
c21085 +++$+++ Your mother.
c21085 +++$+++ Of course not.
c21085 +++$+++ Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
c04517 +++$+++ What?
c04517 +++$+++ You've got to go to sleep now.
c04517 +++$+++ I don't blame you... this hasn't been what you'd call a fun vacation...
c18750 +++$+++ Too bad.
c18750 +++$+++ Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
c18750 +++$+++ And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
c16061 +++$+++ They're tight.
c16061 +++$+++ They're nines.
c16061 +++$+++ Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
c16061 +++$+++ You can buy new ones tomorrow.
c16061 +++$+++ Oh, thanks.
c16061 +++$+++ You're a prince.
c17423 +++$+++ Been doin' a job?
c17423 +++$+++ Yeah.
c17423 +++$+++ I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
c17423 +++$+++ Why don't you get to it, buddy?
c17423 +++$+++ Get to what?
c17423 +++$+++ You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
c17423 +++$+++ I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
c17423 +++$+++ Naw--not much!
c17423 +++$+++ I stay in my own yard.
c17423 +++$+++ Listen. That big nose of yours been goin' over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' it a secret. I been in the penitentiary. Been there four years. Like to know anything else?
c17423 +++$+++ You ain't got to get sore.
c17423 +++$+++ Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
c17423 +++$+++ I didn't mean nothing.
c17423 +++$+++ Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
c17423 +++$+++ That's where I get off.
c02331 +++$+++ So help me, Gladys.
c02331 +++$+++ Becky was my only shot at state!
c02331 +++$+++ Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
c00136 +++$+++ Speak English!
c00136 +++$+++ You said speak Czech!
c00136 +++$+++ I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
c17377 +++$+++ So you might be working for Uncle Sam.
c17377 +++$+++ I don't know.
c17377 +++$+++ Gerry says the meeting went well.
c17377 +++$+++ I guess.
c17377 +++$+++ What did I think?
c00607 +++$+++ Oh, thank you, sir.
c00607 +++$+++ Do any pupils come to the house?
c00607 +++$+++ Not that I've seen.
c00607 +++$+++ Then how does he pay for all this? Does he work at all?
c00607 +++$+++ Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
c00607 +++$+++ Really? What is it he's writing?
c00607 +++$+++ Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
c14949 +++$+++ This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
c14949 +++$+++ They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
c14949 +++$+++ Oh.
c26001 +++$+++ Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
c26001 +++$+++ No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
c26001 +++$+++ Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
c26001 +++$+++ I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
c26001 +++$+++ My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
c26001 +++$+++ That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
c26001 +++$+++ I don't think you're going to do that.
c26001 +++$+++ You don't?  Listen to this woman in a man's world, a very violent world.
c26001 +++$+++ But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
c14335 +++$+++ ... all those voices... you gather them all together.  Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
c14335 +++$+++ You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
c14335 +++$+++ So.  What happens now?
c14335 +++$+++ Now... you go home.
c14335 +++$+++ No!  I mean... why so soon?
c14335 +++$+++ None taken... but ... do we get to come back?  Others of my kind, I mean.
c24491 +++$+++ It's true. It's true.
c24491 +++$+++ Lois, I . . .
c24491 +++$+++ Oh come on, that's ridic -
c13532 +++$+++ Are you guys all right?
c13532 +++$+++ You could've killed us.
c13532 +++$+++ It was the fugitive in the Chrysler that caused this.  We were trying to overtake him.
c13532 +++$+++ No reason to kill innocent bystanders.  Shit.  I can't hardly move my neck.
c13532 +++$+++ I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
c23749 +++$+++ Where can I find Buzz Fazeli?
c23749 +++$+++ Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
c23749 +++$+++ It belonged to my dad.
c07385 +++$+++ Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
c07385 +++$+++ I'm dizzy, not deaf.
c07385 +++$+++ Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  Did you see any sugar in here?  Any candy bars, anything sweet?
c07385 +++$+++ Huh uh.
c07385 +++$+++ Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
c07385 +++$+++ What if I keep dropping?
c07385 +++$+++ What if I do?
c15759 +++$+++ Got it.
c15759 +++$+++ Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
c15759 +++$+++ You've thought of everything.
c05365 +++$+++ The White Castle has fallen.
c05365 +++$+++ Does the Queen live?
c05365 +++$+++ The new Queen lives.
c05365 +++$+++ Turold's son was to marry her.
c05365 +++$+++ I have lived in this place, like my fathers before me, guarding the old knowledge. I knew, when I had no son, that the Great War would come in my time, and that I would be the one to pass on the old knowledge to a new king. Come.
c18692 +++$+++ Did you bring it with you?
c18692 +++$+++ I hope I'm not intruding?
c18692 +++$+++ Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
c23497 +++$+++ So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
c23497 +++$+++ It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
c23497 +++$+++ Well?
c23497 +++$+++ It wasn't my fault.
c23497 +++$+++ The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
c08742 +++$+++ "And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
c08742 +++$+++ Book?
c08742 +++$+++ My Thomas is a little rusty.
c10750 +++$+++ But will he... ?
c10750 +++$+++ Your daddy will always love you.
c10750 +++$+++ How do you know?
c10750 +++$+++ I know because... it's just something I know.
c10750 +++$+++ Robin, listen to me.
c04707 +++$+++ Hello Marylin.
c04707 +++$+++ Hello Miles.
c04707 +++$+++ Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
c04707 +++$+++ It's not something I wanted either.
c04707 +++$+++ Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
c08645 +++$+++ Where are you going?
c08645 +++$+++ I'm just some big clown to you, ain't I?
c08645 +++$+++ Out.
c22014 +++$+++ Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
c22014 +++$+++ Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
c22014 +++$+++ How goes it, darlin'?
c22014 +++$+++ What do you think of her, honey?
c12402 +++$+++ Bad dream, darling?
c12402 +++$+++ I've got to leave Malkovich.
c12402 +++$+++ I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
c17962 +++$+++ You test each one thoroughly?
c17962 +++$+++ You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
c17962 +++$+++ Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.
c17972 +++$+++ Everything breaks at once.
c17972 +++$+++ Isn't that always the way?
c17972 +++$+++ So, you're just kind of a roving --
c17972 +++$+++ Oh, that's fine.
c06033 +++$+++ There won't be a next thing.
c06033 +++$+++ Take a few days --
c06033 +++$+++ I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
c18683 +++$+++ Shit....
c18683 +++$+++ Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
c18683 +++$+++ Shove it....
c18683 +++$+++ You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
c18683 +++$+++ Stop that!
c18683 +++$+++ You don't like my voice...?
c18683 +++$+++ Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
c12479 +++$+++ Oh shit.  Walter.
c12479 +++$+++ What the fuck is going on there?
c12479 +++$+++ They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
c12479 +++$+++ Easy, Dude.
c12479 +++$+++ Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
c16938 +++$+++ You okay?
c16938 +++$+++ Where do we go from here?
c16938 +++$+++ I don't know, airport I guess.
c16938 +++$+++ Yeah.
c14746 +++$+++ She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
c14746 +++$+++ But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
c14746 +++$+++ She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
c04488 +++$+++ I ought to tell you something.
c04488 +++$+++ Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
c04488 +++$+++ The floor's on fire! See?!
c04488 +++$+++ What???
c04488 +++$+++ All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
c18708 +++$+++ What exactly you doing, John?
c18708 +++$+++ I'm going up to the institute.
c18708 +++$+++ This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
c07582 +++$+++ Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
c07582 +++$+++ Gloria Golden?
c07582 +++$+++ Yeah, little Gloria.
c07582 +++$+++ The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
c07582 +++$+++ Right - for the first time this year.
c07582 +++$+++ Well - it's only April.
c07582 +++$+++ Come on, get going, get going!
c07582 +++$+++ Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
c07582 +++$+++ Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
c07582 +++$+++ All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
c07582 +++$+++ I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
c14413 +++$+++ Who turned off the Internet computer...
c14413 +++$+++ I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
c14413 +++$+++ He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
c14413 +++$+++ Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
c14413 +++$+++ Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
c14413 +++$+++ Clint is putting a guard on you. But if you swear to leave the computer on, Winona will assign him to the hall outside.
c12052 +++$+++ Is that the best quality you have?
c12052 +++$+++ Yeah, it's the best one.
c12052 +++$+++ I'll take the whole tin.
c12052 +++$+++ I'll take it.  Andy, gimme three thousand dollars.  Just the caviar - I'll get the rest.
c01871 +++$+++ Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
c01871 +++$+++ But I... I need those books.
c01871 +++$+++ Photos?
c05033 +++$+++ Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
c05033 +++$+++ Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
c05033 +++$+++ Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
c05033 +++$+++ Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
c05033 +++$+++ Jacob Singer.
c19551 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Claudia.
c19551 +++$+++ What is it?  Did you forget something?
c19551 +++$+++ No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
c19551 +++$+++ You wanna go on a date with me?
c19551 +++$+++ Please, yes.
c19551 +++$+++ Well...is that illegal?
c19551 +++$+++ No.
c19551 +++$+++ Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
c19551 +++$+++ I don't know.  I haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- I have thought about it.  I've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
c19551 +++$+++ Really?
c19551 +++$+++ I thought you were flirting with me a little.
c19517 +++$+++ No.
c19517 +++$+++ C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
c19517 +++$+++ Well, can you give him this for me?
c12495 +++$+++ I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
c12495 +++$+++ Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
c12495 +++$+++ I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
c12495 +++$+++ What's your point, Dude?
c12495 +++$+++ His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
c12495 +++$+++ Yeah?
c12495 +++$+++ Shit yeah!
c12495 +++$+++ Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
c12495 +++$+++ Huh?
c12495 +++$+++ I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
c12495 +++$+++ Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
c12495 +++$+++ What the fuck are you talking about?
c12495 +++$+++ You're fucking Polish Catholic--
c12495 +++$+++ What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
c12495 +++$+++ Yeah, and you were--
c12495 +++$+++ You know this!
c12495 +++$+++ And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
c12495 +++$+++ Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
c12495 +++$+++ This driveway.
c12495 +++$+++ I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
c12495 +++$+++ Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?
c09749 +++$+++ Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
c09749 +++$+++ But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
c09749 +++$+++ I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
c09749 +++$+++ I'm not heartless, Ma'am.  I have every sympathy for you and for the little girl, but if I were to consent to every operation brought to me, I'd have no time for teaching -- and that's a great responsibility upon me, Ma'am -- a great responsibility.
c16076 +++$+++ Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?
c16076 +++$+++ Born and bred.
c16076 +++$+++ We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
c03468 +++$+++ Oh my God.
c03468 +++$+++ Pardon?
c03468 +++$+++ Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
c03468 +++$+++ What's wrong?
c03468 +++$+++ Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
c03468 +++$+++ What?
c03468 +++$+++ I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
c03468 +++$+++ Like what?
c03468 +++$+++ What do you think?
c03468 +++$+++ Well I don't know.
c03468 +++$+++ For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
c03468 +++$+++ Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
c00441 +++$+++ Uh, we got a problem here.
c00441 +++$+++ Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
c00441 +++$+++ Lemme take a look.
c24101 +++$+++ Oh, my God.
c24101 +++$+++ Right.  Which is the whole <u>point</u> of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
c24101 +++$+++ Doesn't <u>begin</u> to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, <u>this</u> is serious.
c17657 +++$+++ What did he say?
c17657 +++$+++ He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
c17657 +++$+++ He said something else. "It's all right now. He's gone. The evil's gone."
c13642 +++$+++ She was --
c13642 +++$+++ And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
c13642 +++$+++ Yes.
c13642 +++$+++ Can't remember...
c09218 +++$+++ I am not a good singer.
c09218 +++$+++ That was beautiful.
c09218 +++$+++ Yes. Sing some more.
c16391 +++$+++ You could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it couldn't be...
c16391 +++$+++ You... you can't be serious about this.
c16391 +++$+++ What a ridiculous thing to say.
c16391 +++$+++ I can't let you...
c16391 +++$+++ ...go through with this? What are you going to do?
c16391 +++$+++ I'm going to...
c16391 +++$+++ ...stop me?
c16391 +++$+++ I'm not going...
c16391 +++$+++ ...to let this happen!
c16391 +++$+++ ...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that.
c15413 +++$+++ He's who we want to go with.
c15413 +++$+++ This guy.
c15413 +++$+++ I'm not sure about the entire concept.
c00468 +++$+++ Elaine!
c00468 +++$+++ Ted!
c00468 +++$+++ Ted, there's no time to explain.
c12893 +++$+++ Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
c12893 +++$+++ Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
c12893 +++$+++ Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
c14327 +++$+++ Dr. Cullers?
c14327 +++$+++ Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
c14327 +++$+++ Ellie.  Pulsar?
c14327 +++$+++ Nice.  Where?
c03534 +++$+++ You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
c03534 +++$+++ I don't want them now.
c03534 +++$+++ I'll not denounce you.
c03534 +++$+++ I know.
c03534 +++$+++ So --
c03534 +++$+++ Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
c03534 +++$+++ But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
c03534 +++$+++ I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
c03534 +++$+++ I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
c20360 +++$+++ Er ... if ... we ... er ...
c20360 +++$+++ Yes?
c20360 +++$+++ Look, it's  simple.  Just stay here and make sure he doesn't leave the room.
c24640 +++$+++ Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
c24640 +++$+++ No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
c24640 +++$+++ He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
c26450 +++$+++ Uh, no. No, I ain't drunk.
c26450 +++$+++ Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
c26450 +++$+++ Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
c26450 +++$+++ Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
c26450 +++$+++ I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
c26450 +++$+++ You're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
c26450 +++$+++ Like I said, I...
c26450 +++$+++ Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
c12874 +++$+++ Oh.
c12874 +++$+++ I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
c12874 +++$+++ Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
c12874 +++$+++ The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
c12874 +++$+++ I think he's running for town crier next year.
c12874 +++$+++ I understand.  That's very kind of you.
c16895 +++$+++ Everybody goes there.
c16895 +++$+++ You may as well invite her here.
c16895 +++$+++ Will you be okay?
c16895 +++$+++ Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
c16895 +++$+++ We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
c16895 +++$+++ How long?
c16895 +++$+++ I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
c19111 +++$+++ Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
c19111 +++$+++ The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
c19111 +++$+++ He's here, Ardelia.
c19787 +++$+++ Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're not getting BOTH of them!  It's physically impossible!
c19787 +++$+++ Why's that?  You said over and over and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy Kaufman --
c19787 +++$+++ Sure it is.  Tony called me himself. He yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than Andy's. They're both going on tonight, believe me!
c25793 +++$+++ I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
c25793 +++$+++ Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
c25793 +++$+++ Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
c25793 +++$+++ No. <U>Knots</U>!
c25793 +++$+++ What?
c25793 +++$+++ I can see you're no gentleman--
c07502 +++$+++ Why are brothering with that?
c07502 +++$+++ My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
c07502 +++$+++ Good.
c04681 +++$+++ You should have tried to get pregnant Marylin -- solidify your position.
c04681 +++$+++ No.
c04681 +++$+++ I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
c02027 +++$+++ I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
c02027 +++$+++ Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
c02027 +++$+++ "...did." Well, okay.
c02027 +++$+++ Please don't...
c02027 +++$+++ You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
c04868 +++$+++ Honey, you all right?
c04868 +++$+++ It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
c04868 +++$+++ I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
c04868 +++$+++ Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
c04868 +++$+++ These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
c04868 +++$+++ And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
c04868 +++$+++ Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
c04868 +++$+++ Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
c04868 +++$+++ Goddammit!  I been sleeping for three years!
c01701 +++$+++ I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
c01701 +++$+++ Fuck you Vincenzo.
c01701 +++$+++ I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
c10522 +++$+++ I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
c10522 +++$+++ Nobody says you have to be like me.
c10522 +++$+++ You don't give him enough credit Chas.
c24216 +++$+++ So am I.
c24216 +++$+++ Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
c24216 +++$+++ Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
c08876 +++$+++ How do they know?
c08876 +++$+++ You told them, Hoffy.
c08876 +++$+++ Who did?
c08876 +++$+++ You did!
c08876 +++$+++ Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
c18502 +++$+++ Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
c18502 +++$+++ Okay. Three-twenty Sycamore? . . .
c18502 +++$+++ All right.
c16915 +++$+++ Where did you get those?
c16915 +++$+++ I've been doing my homework.
c16915 +++$+++ Just like old times?
c16915 +++$+++ Better than old times.
c16915 +++$+++ I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
c16915 +++$+++ I made a mistake. I'll never make another one.
c16915 +++$+++ Where did you get them developed?
c16915 +++$+++ Good.
c19112 +++$+++ "Desperately random." What does he mean?
c19112 +++$+++ Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
c19112 +++$+++ But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
c19112 +++$+++ Well, except for the one girl.
c19112 +++$+++ The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
c22879 +++$+++ I wanna play a game.
c22879 +++$+++ No...
c22879 +++$+++ Then he dies. Right now.
c22879 +++$+++ Which is it?
c02449 +++$+++ Bye, Leif.
c02449 +++$+++ Bye... sorry...
c02449 +++$+++ Yeah... well...
c02449 +++$+++ What d'you expect me to do?
c27356 +++$+++ That's how you eat? It's like a gerbil.
c27356 +++$+++ I'm from L.A.
c27356 +++$+++ So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
c27356 +++$+++ Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
c27356 +++$+++ Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
c27356 +++$+++ Don't judge a comic book by it's cover.
c27356 +++$+++ You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
c27356 +++$+++ I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
c27356 +++$+++ Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
c27356 +++$+++ The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
c27356 +++$+++ All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
c27356 +++$+++ We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
c27356 +++$+++ So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
c05449 +++$+++ I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
c05449 +++$+++ To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
c05449 +++$+++ Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
c05522 +++$+++ Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
c05522 +++$+++ I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
c05522 +++$+++ But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
c05522 +++$+++ Haven't you seen the cabana boy?
c07299 +++$+++ No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
c07299 +++$+++ Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
c07299 +++$+++ Well, that's how I characterize it.
c07299 +++$+++ Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
c07299 +++$+++ Wipin' little circles with his bread...
c14440 +++$+++ So what have we got?
c14440 +++$+++ It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
c14440 +++$+++ Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
c14440 +++$+++ You're damn right I do.
c14440 +++$+++ I'm sorry it had to come to your attention.  I am dealing with it.
c20768 +++$+++ But you see, that's okay, Wayne.
c20768 +++$+++ Why?
c20768 +++$+++ They passed the 'edge' along to us.
c20768 +++$+++ How so?
c20768 +++$+++ By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
c20768 +++$+++ Never is a very long time, Wayne. A word only the weak use. I'm not a sore loser. Even if I don't have a leg to stand on, I'm going to get up and fight this world until I'm on top again.
c15352 +++$+++ From today on, our lives are different!  We'll be swimming laps in the same pool Jean Harlow did.
c15352 +++$+++ I don't know.  It's so much money...
c15352 +++$+++ Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
c15352 +++$+++ But <u>you</u> do!  And anyway, I've got tons of new scripts.  And now that I have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
c09653 +++$+++ Did you drive up from San Francisco?
c09653 +++$+++ Yes.
c09653 +++$+++ It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
c09653 +++$+++ I guess that's where everyone meets him.
c05837 +++$+++ What are you guys doin'?
c05837 +++$+++ Guess we're goin' over to the "Ten Pin".
c05837 +++$+++ Sure.
c17386 +++$+++ Great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
c17386 +++$+++ What?
c17386 +++$+++ Okay, sounds good.
c01659 +++$+++ What was that all about?
c01659 +++$+++ Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
c01659 +++$+++ It's good to see you.
c01659 +++$+++ Where to?
c01659 +++$+++ Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
c01659 +++$+++ I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
c01659 +++$+++ It's okay.
c01659 +++$+++ You look beautiful.
c01659 +++$+++ I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
c24874 +++$+++ -- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
c24874 +++$+++ You ever been to London?
c24874 +++$+++ Only in the movies.
c24874 +++$+++ I've 'ardly ever left it.
c24874 +++$+++ Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
c24874 +++$+++ Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
c10066 +++$+++ The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
c10066 +++$+++ We will, but first I have a surprise.
c10066 +++$+++ The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
c08707 +++$+++ You're trying to save Sparazza?
c08707 +++$+++ No... We're trying to save Heller.
c08707 +++$+++ ...So you knew all this and yet y--
c08707 +++$+++ -- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
c08707 +++$+++ I don't see it like that at all.
c07508 +++$+++ I think he's telling the truth.
c07508 +++$+++ He's not telling the truth.
c07508 +++$+++ If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
c06495 +++$+++ Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resume. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
c06495 +++$+++ Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
c06495 +++$+++ <i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
c11118 +++$+++ You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
c11118 +++$+++ Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
c11118 +++$+++ I will.
c06333 +++$+++ You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
c06333 +++$+++ Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
c06333 +++$+++ Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
c10163 +++$+++ This Jimmy's?
c10163 +++$+++ You're not gonna catch him. He can shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.
c10163 +++$+++ Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
c10163 +++$+++ Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
c10163 +++$+++ He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
c10163 +++$+++ -- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
c10163 +++$+++ Who did?
c10163 +++$+++ You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
c10163 +++$+++ Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
c26495 +++$+++ I know who he is.
c26495 +++$+++ I hope I didn't disturb you.
c26495 +++$+++ A glass of water would be nice.
c27329 +++$+++ Their real names, please.
c27329 +++$+++ I don't know their real names.
c27329 +++$+++ You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
c27329 +++$+++ I don't know their real names!
c27329 +++$+++ Then why don't you ask him?!?
c16039 +++$+++ We're not getting paid then.
c16039 +++$+++ No.
c16039 +++$+++ Nothing. We get nothing.
c16039 +++$+++ I told you, Jack.  It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
c16039 +++$+++ What's it for?
c16039 +++$+++ I don't know. Some disease.
c16039 +++$+++ What disease?
c16039 +++$+++ I don't know.
c16039 +++$+++ You don't know?
c16039 +++$+++ It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
c16039 +++$+++ What channels it on?
c16039 +++$+++ Seventy-one
c16039 +++$+++ A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
c18561 +++$+++ Thank you.  I'll tell him.
c18561 +++$+++ For me?
c18561 +++$+++ Damn.
c13118 +++$+++ That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
c13118 +++$+++ Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
c13118 +++$+++ What do you think?
c13118 +++$+++ Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
c13118 +++$+++ I wanted to bring them in, to see if he'd respond to voices, but they weren't in the waiting room. The guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when I finally have something positive to tell her, she's gone.
c03142 +++$+++ I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
c03142 +++$+++ What money?
c03142 +++$+++ Shylock?
c02306 +++$+++ So, what do I say?
c02306 +++$+++ Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
c02306 +++$+++ Yeah, you betcha...
c08173 +++$+++ Cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
c08173 +++$+++ Yeah, I know, I just love having a guy for a friend.
c08173 +++$+++ I know, but I've been thinking --
c08173 +++$+++ I know, but I've been thinking --
c08173 +++$+++ Listen to me I --
c08173 +++$+++ Listen to me I --
c08173 +++$+++ Look, what I'm trying to say --
c04956 +++$+++ He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
c04956 +++$+++ Beaumont Livingston?
c04956 +++$+++ You already knew that?
c04956 +++$+++ So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag -- Is it tempting?
c14302 +++$+++ Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
c14302 +++$+++ The truth shall make you free.
c14302 +++$+++ Only on the football field.
c07706 +++$+++ Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
c07706 +++$+++ I don't know.
c07706 +++$+++ I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
c07706 +++$+++ I don't know.
c07706 +++$+++ Do you know them.
c07706 +++$+++ Not very well.
c07706 +++$+++ Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
c07706 +++$+++ I think that'll be fine.
c22672 +++$+++ What about our grenades?
c22672 +++$+++ Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
c22672 +++$+++ Would they notice and eighty-eight?
c22672 +++$+++ The Germans do.
c07692 +++$+++ Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
c07692 +++$+++ I'm just stopping by to say hello.
c07692 +++$+++ Hello.
c07692 +++$+++ So you're coming tonight, right?
c07692 +++$+++ Yes, indeed, yes I am.
c07692 +++$+++ There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
c07692 +++$+++ Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
c07692 +++$+++ Why?
c07692 +++$+++ Well I don't want to do something like that.
c07692 +++$+++ She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
c07692 +++$+++ Yeah, but please don't do that.
c07692 +++$+++ I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
c07692 +++$+++ Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
c07692 +++$+++ It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
c07692 +++$+++ Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
c07692 +++$+++ That's your fault not mine.
c07692 +++$+++ I don't think I'm going to the party.
c07692 +++$+++ So it's ok if I bring her.
c07692 +++$+++ Please don't.
c07692 +++$+++ She's really cute and she's really nice.
c07692 +++$+++ ...please, I just don't want it....
c07692 +++$+++ ....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
c07692 +++$+++ Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
c07692 +++$+++ I'm trying to be your friend.
c07692 +++$+++ I know.
c07692 +++$+++ I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
c07692 +++$+++ -- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
c22911 +++$+++ You sure I can stay over? My dad won't be back til Sunday.
c22911 +++$+++ No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
c22911 +++$+++ Tell your mom I said thanks.
c22911 +++$+++ Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
c22911 +++$+++ Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
c22911 +++$+++ I'll be there by seven. I promise
c22911 +++$+++ Later.
c12660 +++$+++ Can I give you a kiss good night?
c12660 +++$+++ You better not, Jeffrey.
c12660 +++$+++ Okay. okay.
c12660 +++$+++ See ya tomorrow.
c00776 +++$+++ The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
c00776 +++$+++ You are a fine figure of a man.
c00776 +++$+++ Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
c00776 +++$+++ He's been full of vinegar lately.
c00776 +++$+++ He's planning a job.
c00776 +++$+++ What?
c00776 +++$+++ Tell me.
c17038 +++$+++ Will you excuse...
c17038 +++$+++ Where did Moss...?  I...
c17038 +++$+++ Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I...
c10569 +++$+++ So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
c10569 +++$+++ Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
c10569 +++$+++ Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
c10569 +++$+++ Sounds right... I'll check it out.
c10569 +++$+++ You hitched yet?
c10569 +++$+++ No sir...
c10569 +++$+++ It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
c10569 +++$+++ Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
c10569 +++$+++ I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
c10138 +++$+++ Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
c10138 +++$+++ Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
c10138 +++$+++ That may be what they want us to think.
c25059 +++$+++ There's always a chance they'll confess.
c25059 +++$+++ Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
c25059 +++$+++ Okay.  Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead.  Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I'm sorry, I really am.
c15384 +++$+++ Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
c15384 +++$+++ No! I love sex with girls.
c15384 +++$+++ Okay?
c18917 +++$+++ Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper --
c18917 +++$+++ Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
c18917 +++$+++ Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
c18917 +++$+++ Did he come around often?
c12207 +++$+++ I always thought there was something wrong with him. Heh heh heh.
c12207 +++$+++ Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
c12207 +++$+++ Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
c19289 +++$+++ Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
c19289 +++$+++ You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
c19289 +++$+++ All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
c18560 +++$+++ Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
c18560 +++$+++ Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
c18560 +++$+++ One what?  Ah-ha!
c18560 +++$+++ It's an island.  Got to run.
c20940 +++$+++ Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!
c20940 +++$+++ Mom?
c20940 +++$+++ What are you still doing up?  It's past one.
c20940 +++$+++ Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
c15507 +++$+++ Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
c15507 +++$+++ Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
c15507 +++$+++ You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.
c15754 +++$+++ Camera in the--
c15754 +++$+++ Bookshelf. Sensors--
c15754 +++$+++ In eye of that painting.
c14867 +++$+++ Presence.
c14867 +++$+++ Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
c14867 +++$+++ At a press conference.
c14867 +++$+++ That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts `em right out there.
c21984 +++$+++ Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
c21984 +++$+++ What did you expect?
c21984 +++$+++ Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
c21984 +++$+++ Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
c21984 +++$+++ There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
c21984 +++$+++ Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
c21984 +++$+++ Actually, I am, though.
c21984 +++$+++ You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
c21984 +++$+++ Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose?
c21984 +++$+++ No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
c21984 +++$+++ Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like?
c21984 +++$+++ But I'm curious, Rose.
c16980 +++$+++ You all right now?
c16980 +++$+++ Yeah.
c16980 +++$+++ No.
c26872 +++$+++ Grand Marnier.
c26872 +++$+++ Sounds like a french word, what is it?
c26872 +++$+++ Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
c23426 +++$+++ Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
c23426 +++$+++ No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.
c23426 +++$+++ Well, okay. I got you some.
c23426 +++$+++ Frank, he went off, too. He ain't gonna be in there when you get indoors.
c23426 +++$+++ Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
c23426 +++$+++ He wanted to go off and play, I reckon.  You go in there and you and that Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have to worry yourself none.
c23426 +++$+++ All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
c23426 +++$+++ Ma'am?
c23426 +++$+++ Yeah.
c23426 +++$+++ You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
c23426 +++$+++ Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
c23426 +++$+++ You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
c23426 +++$+++ Thank ye.  I'm just getting around to tellin' you, but I fixed your warshin' machine.
c00585 +++$+++ Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
c00585 +++$+++ That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
c00585 +++$+++ Yes.
c21314 +++$+++ Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
c21314 +++$+++ I told you, he isn't here.
c21314 +++$+++ Out for the evening?
c21314 +++$+++ When's he due back?
c12746 +++$+++ Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
c12746 +++$+++ I understand. What's your question?
c12746 +++$+++ The questions have already been asked. I would only like some precise answers, that's all ...
c12746 +++$+++ Let's try to be precise then. The word "torture" does not appear in our orders. We have always spoken of interrogation as the only valid method in a police operation directed against unknown enemies. As for the NLF, they request that their members, in the event of capture, should maintain silence for twenty-four hours, and then, they may talk. Thus, the organization has already had the time necessary to render useless any information furnished ... What type of interrogation should we choose? ... the one the courts use for a crime of homicide which drags on for months?
c12746 +++$+++ And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
c22362 +++$+++ Well what do you know!  An air conditioner.
c22362 +++$+++ And not just any air conditioner. This baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
c22362 +++$+++ Yep, fifteen thousand BTU's, enough to cool off this whole place.
c09517 +++$+++ Did he kill Freddie?
c09517 +++$+++ Marge, when did you get here?
c09517 +++$+++ Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
c09517 +++$+++ I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
c09517 +++$+++ I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
c09517 +++$+++ Dickie did it.
c09517 +++$+++ Dickie?
c09517 +++$+++ My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have. About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us. And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me.  Are you getting on?
c09517 +++$+++ Get on. I'll take you to him.
c26590 +++$+++ It's not a good case.  It's a very good case.  A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anaesthetic ...
c26590 +++$+++ ... we, we love her, Dick and me ...
c26590 +++$+++ ... I'm sure you do ...
c26590 +++$+++ But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
c26590 +++$+++ ... I know.  I went ...
c26590 +++$+++ ... You saw her?
c26590 +++$+++ Yes.  Yes, I have.
c26590 +++$+++ You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
c26590 +++$+++ ... fifty thousand dollars?
c26590 +++$+++ I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
c26590 +++$+++ ... I understand ...
c26590 +++$+++ My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
c26590 +++$+++ ... But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson ... and they called him  up and said to come out. He's a good man.  He's only trying to do what's right.
c02073 +++$+++ Attractive girl.
c02073 +++$+++ Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
c02073 +++$+++ Very much so.
c00267 +++$+++ Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
c00267 +++$+++ Got it.
c00267 +++$+++ Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
c19510 +++$+++ I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
c19510 +++$+++ It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
c19510 +++$+++ So why'd you give up ball?
c19510 +++$+++ Why do you keep asking me that?
c19510 +++$+++ Cause I don't get it.
c19510 +++$+++ What?
c18746 +++$+++ Can I help?
c18746 +++$+++ Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
c18746 +++$+++ I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
c18746 +++$+++ Hmm.  Pretty good.
c18746 +++$+++ My son... my mind...
c22522 +++$+++ Men never get this movie.
c22522 +++$+++ I know.
c22522 +++$+++ I always wondered about that too.
c10860 +++$+++ You liked Sister Paul?
c10860 +++$+++ She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
c10860 +++$+++ She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
c09889 +++$+++ It's spectacular...
c09889 +++$+++ Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
c09889 +++$+++ I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
c09889 +++$+++ Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
c09889 +++$+++ There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
c20669 +++$+++ Luckily.  The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus.  Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
c20669 +++$+++ Such as.
c20669 +++$+++ She's too genuine.
c20669 +++$+++ Hate that.
c20669 +++$+++ What's next?
c07229 +++$+++ I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
c07229 +++$+++ I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
c07229 +++$+++ No, I mean your dedication scares me...
c07229 +++$+++ It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
c07229 +++$+++ Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
c07229 +++$+++ ...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
c07229 +++$+++ Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
c07229 +++$+++ Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
c07229 +++$+++ You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
c07229 +++$+++ Yes... maybe it was.
c17941 +++$+++ You!
c17941 +++$+++ Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
c17941 +++$+++ Turn that thing off.
c17941 +++$+++ How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
c17941 +++$+++ What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
c24573 +++$+++ Are you sure?
c24573 +++$+++ Yeah.
c24573 +++$+++ It just seems...kind of weird.
c24573 +++$+++ Why?
c24573 +++$+++ I don't know.
c24573 +++$+++ Nicole, I'm just going to pack all this stuff and give it to the church for charity.  Don't feel bad. Unless you feel strange about wearing it.
c24573 +++$+++ And she really liked you.  She would've given you all this if she'd outgrown it, or...
c04927 +++$+++ Hi, I'm Max Cherry. Your bail bondsman.
c04927 +++$+++ The day you got me out of jail?
c04927 +++$+++ Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
c04927 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c04470 +++$+++ The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
c04470 +++$+++ Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
c04470 +++$+++ Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
c02373 +++$+++ So that's the one you want to marry.
c02373 +++$+++ With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control --
c02373 +++$+++ That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
c10044 +++$+++ Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health...  I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
c10044 +++$+++ What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
c10044 +++$+++ Never met him.
c10044 +++$+++ Amen to that.
c18841 +++$+++ Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
c18841 +++$+++ Yes it is.
c18841 +++$+++ It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
c18841 +++$+++ No.
c18841 +++$+++ Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
c18841 +++$+++ This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
c18841 +++$+++ What if the car falls?  What if the wheels fall?
c21846 +++$+++ Help!
c21846 +++$+++ All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
c21846 +++$+++ Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
c21846 +++$+++ Oh, it's all right ... wha?
c21846 +++$+++ Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
c21846 +++$+++ Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
c21846 +++$+++ Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
c27437 +++$+++ It seem to have stopped the big fellow in his tracks.
c27437 +++$+++ Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
c27437 +++$+++ Act casual!
c22037 +++$+++ Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
c22037 +++$+++ Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
c22037 +++$+++ Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
c22037 +++$+++ Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
c22037 +++$+++ Oh, no, sir.
c20403 +++$+++ Mr Brown.
c20403 +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
c20403 +++$+++ You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
c20403 +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
c20403 +++$+++ Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
c17508 +++$+++ Everything under control?
c17508 +++$+++ Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
c17508 +++$+++ Just make yourself comfortable.
c17508 +++$+++ Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
c22659 +++$+++ Report.
c22659 +++$+++ Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
c22659 +++$+++ Resistance?
c22659 +++$+++ A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
c22659 +++$+++ Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
c27001 +++$+++ What's that for?
c27001 +++$+++ Nothing.
c27001 +++$+++ I'm cooking you dinner.
c27001 +++$+++ You don't have to do that.
c27001 +++$+++ Fine.  I'll do the shopping.
c10401 +++$+++ ...what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years? This is a... why? Why would you do that?
c10401 +++$+++ I thought I would need it.
c10401 +++$+++ After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
c11228 +++$+++ So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
c11228 +++$+++ I don't know.  How do you?
c11228 +++$+++ Okay.
c25574 +++$+++ It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.
c25574 +++$+++ What about the gold?
c25574 +++$+++ What about it?
c25574 +++$+++ Maybe we should split it up now.
c25574 +++$+++ What if we get separated?  Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
c25728 +++$+++ I think you'd better go.
c25728 +++$+++ Ever had a romance with a crook?
c25728 +++$+++ I beg your pardon!
c25728 +++$+++ Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
c25728 +++$+++ I don't want your money!
c06050 +++$+++ Holy shit. Can you believe this?
c06050 +++$+++ Pretty nice.
c06050 +++$+++ See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
c06050 +++$+++ What's the movie?
c06050 +++$+++ Nah, don't bother --
c21459 +++$+++ Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct?
c21459 +++$+++ That's correct.
c21459 +++$+++ I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
c15132 +++$+++ Yeah, just trying to handle some year old twinkies.  Yucck.  What do they put in these things?
c15132 +++$+++ 'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
c15132 +++$+++ Not yet, the wife in working on our first.  You got any kids back on the ranch?
c20118 +++$+++ Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
c20118 +++$+++ I think so. One right, two lefts...
c20118 +++$+++ Right.
c04145 +++$+++ I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
c04145 +++$+++ Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
c04145 +++$+++ Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
c04145 +++$+++ And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
c04145 +++$+++ But --
c04145 +++$+++ I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.
c01985 +++$+++ What brings you out to the sticks?
c01985 +++$+++ Had a package to deliver.
c01985 +++$+++ You?  Personally?
c01985 +++$+++ Must be a story there.
c17940 +++$+++ Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta see him, I got my reasons, very goddamn important...
c17940 +++$+++ Use the phone, Bernie, call him tomorrow, he'd like to hear from you.  Where's your other shoe? Never mind!  I don't want to know. Some fantastic adventure, right? Something really crazy.
c17940 +++$+++ Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
c07838 +++$+++ I want you back
c07838 +++$+++ Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
c07838 +++$+++ I don't care.
c19682 +++$+++ So where are you from?
c19682 +++$+++ Up north.
c19682 +++$+++ Where up north?
c19682 +++$+++ You got any family?
c13202 +++$+++ I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
c13202 +++$+++ Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
c13202 +++$+++ We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
c13202 +++$+++ Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
c13202 +++$+++ Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
c13202 +++$+++ It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
c13202 +++$+++ I got promoted for things like that.
c13202 +++$+++ Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
c13202 +++$+++ It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
c13202 +++$+++ It just proves that the difference we have are...
c13202 +++$+++ This is a one-way argument.  We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger deal.  I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here.  The plane's boarding.  You're good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.
c13202 +++$+++ I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.
c26665 +++$+++ Mm. Better.
c26665 +++$+++ Did you need it?
c26665 +++$+++ Oh?
c04198 +++$+++ I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
c04198 +++$+++ Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
c04198 +++$+++ You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
c04198 +++$+++ Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
c24808 +++$+++ Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
c24808 +++$+++ The key?
c24808 +++$+++ Hm?
c24808 +++$+++ Is there a room key?
c24808 +++$+++ No, you didn't...
c14381 +++$+++ But, Luke...
c14381 +++$+++ Take it easy, Drag.
c14381 +++$+++ Luke. Where you goin?
c14381 +++$+++ But what am I gonna do all by myself?  Oh if'n I hadn't lost mah head. I only had two more years to go. But when I saw you tearin' down with that truck... But you right Luke. We oughta split up. Be safer for us both.
c19594 +++$+++ I've heard your tapes on the phone.
c19594 +++$+++ Oh yeah.
c19594 +++$+++ When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
c19594 +++$+++ Uh. huh.
c19594 +++$+++ Mmm.
c22265 +++$+++ You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
c22265 +++$+++ Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
c22265 +++$+++ Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
c09023 +++$+++ As you observed, a primitive Culture.
c09023 +++$+++ Yes.
c09023 +++$+++ Admiral, may I ask you a question?
c09023 +++$+++ Spock, don't call me Admiral. Don't you remember: you used to call me Jim... Now what's your question?
c09023 +++$+++ Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
c09023 +++$+++ For example?
c23347 +++$+++ I will not allow it.  I will not!
c23347 +++$+++ Protest to my superiors if you like.
c23347 +++$+++ Then, you should have left two days ago, because I have men willing to help me today.
c00885 +++$+++ He does? You're sure?
c00885 +++$+++ I checked it out. It's clean.
c00885 +++$+++ Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?
c00885 +++$+++ Where was Marcus?
c00885 +++$+++ He wasn't with Paul Owen.
c00885 +++$+++ He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and -  - you.
c22871 +++$+++ Hello.
c22871 +++$+++ I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.
c22871 +++$+++ So why did you dial it again?
c22871 +++$+++ To apologize.
c22871 +++$+++ Wait, wait, don't hang up.
c14586 +++$+++ Please.
c14586 +++$+++ Thank you for seeing me.  I hear your wedding day is near.  You must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
c14586 +++$+++ I'm hardly doing a thing.  The less I think of it the better.  My parents are arranging everything. The Gous are a very powerful family. My marrying one will be good for my father's career.
c14586 +++$+++ You are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
c14586 +++$+++ Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
c14586 +++$+++ Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
c14586 +++$+++ About you and Li Mu Bai?
c14586 +++$+++ Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
c14586 +++$+++ No, really?
c14586 +++$+++ His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
c14586 +++$+++ Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
c14586 +++$+++ I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
c14586 +++$+++ Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
c25452 +++$+++ I've had it with that bum, Floyd. Stack me a cooler.
c25452 +++$+++ You've only been playin three hours, Doyle.
c25452 +++$+++ I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
c25452 +++$+++ Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard in one play.
c25064 +++$+++ Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano.  Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.
c25064 +++$+++ Delano?
c25064 +++$+++ Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
c25064 +++$+++ I never kid.  My wife hates it.  Says I'm too serious.
c09436 +++$+++ My wife was weeping before she fell asleep, outside my window I saw my caporegimes to the house, and it is midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine, I think you should tell your Don what everyone knows.
c09436 +++$+++ I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
c09436 +++$+++ But you needed a drink first.
c09436 +++$+++ Now you've had your drink.
c18639 +++$+++ Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
c18639 +++$+++ Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
c18639 +++$+++ Look great, don't I?
c18639 +++$+++ Got a job for me?
c18639 +++$+++ Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
c18639 +++$+++ Sharks???
c18639 +++$+++ ... I'll go to McDonalds.
c08667 +++$+++ This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
c08667 +++$+++ On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
c08667 +++$+++ Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
c08667 +++$+++ What's your twenty?
c08667 +++$+++ Not for long, you ain't.
c23157 +++$+++ -- gee...
c23157 +++$+++ -- what?
c23157 +++$+++ I don't know what gets into me.
c23157 +++$+++ You were great.
c23157 +++$+++ No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
c23157 +++$+++ No you didn't.
c23157 +++$+++ You don't think so? I do.
c23157 +++$+++ You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
c16105 +++$+++ Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
c16105 +++$+++ Why not?
c16105 +++$+++ Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
c16105 +++$+++ Ever go to church?
c01331 +++$+++ Mom, would you say you understand Dad?
c01331 +++$+++ Of course.
c01331 +++$+++ What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
c01331 +++$+++ Yes.
c01331 +++$+++ Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
c01351 +++$+++ Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
c01351 +++$+++ Yes.
c01351 +++$+++ Good. Or should I speak slower?
c01351 +++$+++ Yes.
c01351 +++$+++ Yes.
c17181 +++$+++ Good morning.
c17181 +++$+++ Mornin'.
c17181 +++$+++ My name is Whale.  This is my house.
c17181 +++$+++ Nice place.
c17181 +++$+++ And your name is --?
c17181 +++$+++ Boone.  Clayton Boone.
c17181 +++$+++ I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
c17181 +++$+++ The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea.
c06562 +++$+++ You mean--here?
c06562 +++$+++ Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
c06562 +++$+++ But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
c06562 +++$+++ City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop *in* 'em.
c06562 +++$+++ Have you always had to--work?
c06562 +++$+++ Since sixteen or so.
c06562 +++$+++ I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
c06562 +++$+++ No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
c06562 +++$+++ It hasn't been easy, has it?
c06562 +++$+++ No complaints.
c06562 +++$+++ But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
c06562 +++$+++ Have I?
c06562 +++$+++ I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
c06562 +++$+++ I don't see where we are *with* it.
c06562 +++$+++ No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
c06562 +++$+++ Go right ahead.
c06562 +++$+++ Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
c06562 +++$+++ Terrible, thank you.
c06562 +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
c06562 +++$+++ Why?
c06562 +++$+++ Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
c06562 +++$+++ I also answer to whistles.
c06562 +++$+++ You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
c06562 +++$+++ Look--I think we ought to skip it.
c06562 +++$+++ All right. Sure. Just curious. The picture popped into my mind all of a sudden of a pump without a handle-- or something--
c06562 +++$+++ Well, if it's all the same to you--
c06562 +++$+++ I know. It's--Violet.
c06562 +++$+++ It *is* not!
c06562 +++$+++ Abigail.
c06562 +++$+++ No!
c06562 +++$+++ Letitia.
c06562 +++$+++ No!
c06562 +++$+++ Lena.
c06562 +++$+++ No! Stop it!
c06562 +++$+++ I've got more. You better tell me.
c06562 +++$+++ You win. It's--Clarissa.
c06562 +++$+++ Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
c06562 +++$+++ Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
c06562 +++$+++ Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
c06562 +++$+++ Yes. The most beautiful I think I ever--gee--  Say--we're *never* going to finish this thing! Now, here we go, Saunders. I'm going to talk faster'n you can write--
c19856 +++$+++ I was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
c19856 +++$+++ Stripper?
c19856 +++$+++ No...no stripping...as the hostess.
c19856 +++$+++ Hostess?
c19856 +++$+++ Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
c19856 +++$+++ Chinese food?
c19856 +++$+++ Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
c19856 +++$+++ Bye.
c00562 +++$+++ Did you know? Had you heard?
c00562 +++$+++ What?
c00562 +++$+++ The marriage!
c00562 +++$+++ Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
c25321 +++$+++ The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
c25321 +++$+++ Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
c25321 +++$+++ Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
c25321 +++$+++ ... No.
c25321 +++$+++ ... No. In fact, I'd seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn't getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
c26145 +++$+++ Why did you continue to see him?
c26145 +++$+++ He needed my help.
c26145 +++$+++ Not because you were attracted to him?
c26145 +++$+++ No.
c26145 +++$+++ Well, maybe a little.
c05926 +++$+++ I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
c05926 +++$+++ What is it?
c05926 +++$+++ It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
c05926 +++$+++ Man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
c24633 +++$+++ What's going to happen to Dolores?
c24633 +++$+++ I don't know.
c24633 +++$+++ Will the police do anything to her?
c24633 +++$+++ It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
c24633 +++$+++ She'll move away.
c24633 +++$+++ Someplace where no one knows her.  Someplace strange and new.
c20264 +++$+++ Here.
c20264 +++$+++ It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
c20264 +++$+++ It's temporary.
c20264 +++$+++ Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
c20264 +++$+++ Let's go tell your Mother.
c13453 +++$+++ Artie!
c13453 +++$+++ Calm down! Calm down!
c13453 +++$+++ No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
c13453 +++$+++ Stay out of the way!
c13453 +++$+++ We can't help him if -
c25706 +++$+++ Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
c25706 +++$+++ What time is your rendezvous?
c25706 +++$+++ Now, Lily--
c25706 +++$+++ Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
c25706 +++$+++ You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
c25706 +++$+++ That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
c25706 +++$+++ Don't you <u>realize</u>--
c25706 +++$+++ Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
c25706 +++$+++ Lily, you must listen to me.
c25706 +++$+++ Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
c25706 +++$+++ Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
c18534 +++$+++ Hi.
c18534 +++$+++ Hi.
c18534 +++$+++ Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
c18534 +++$+++ To keep from being an old maid.
c18534 +++$+++ You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
c18534 +++$+++ I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
c18534 +++$+++ My baby.
c10494 +++$+++ You okay?
c10494 +++$+++ I'm fine.
c10494 +++$+++ I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
c23595 +++$+++ It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
c23595 +++$+++ It's all right for a bachelor.
c23595 +++$+++ What a beautiful fish.
c23595 +++$+++ Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
c23595 +++$+++ What is it?
c23595 +++$+++ Oh - a member of the herring family.
c23595 +++$+++ They shrink when they're marinated.
c15714 +++$+++ I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
c15714 +++$+++ Why?  Is he staying?
c15714 +++$+++ With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
c15714 +++$+++ We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
c15714 +++$+++ In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
c16033 +++$+++ You saw wrong.
c16033 +++$+++ Huh?
c16033 +++$+++ He's with the hotel.  I called him.
c16033 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c16033 +++$+++ We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
c16033 +++$+++ He was wearing a suit.
c16033 +++$+++ He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
c16033 +++$+++ You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper.  Unlike me.
c00769 +++$+++ You turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
c00769 +++$+++ wasn't anywhere near this place--
c00769 +++$+++ Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
c00769 +++$+++ You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
c02763 +++$+++ I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
c02763 +++$+++ You can always come see it in London.
c02763 +++$+++ Only if you were in it. Are you?
c02763 +++$+++ I wouldn't miss it.
c02763 +++$+++ Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
c02763 +++$+++ Are you an actor?
c02763 +++$+++ Hell yes!... well, okay, I'm still in school. But as soon as I graduate... California, here I come!
c02763 +++$+++ Are you really serious? About acting?
c02763 +++$+++ Why... yes.
c02763 +++$+++ Then don't go to Hollywood.
c02763 +++$+++ Why?
c02763 +++$+++ I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
c02763 +++$+++ No, I don't hate it.
c10720 +++$+++ Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
c10720 +++$+++ Something wrong with that?
c10720 +++$+++ I like the noise.
c16781 +++$+++ Well?
c16781 +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
c16781 +++$+++ I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
c23983 +++$+++ Thank you.
c23983 +++$+++ Read the card.
c23983 +++$+++ "To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
c23983 +++$+++ Oh.
c11240 +++$+++ Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
c11240 +++$+++ So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
c11240 +++$+++ A la votre.
c22226 +++$+++ You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
c22226 +++$+++ Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
c22226 +++$+++ You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
c22226 +++$+++ A Toon?  Noooo.
c22226 +++$+++ Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
c22226 +++$+++ Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
c22226 +++$+++ Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
c22226 +++$+++ Piano.  Guy got away, disappeared into Toontown.  Nobody ever saw him again.
c05776 +++$+++ Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
c05776 +++$+++ I doubt it.
c05776 +++$+++ I won't.
c18699 +++$+++ Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
c18699 +++$+++ So am I. But where's my money?
c18699 +++$+++ Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
c18699 +++$+++ Pay me, and I shut up.
c18699 +++$+++ I haven't got it.
c18699 +++$+++ Then give me that Zippo.
c18699 +++$+++ Why?
c18699 +++$+++ I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
c18699 +++$+++ I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
c05631 +++$+++ I'll have to pay him back.
c05631 +++$+++ I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
c05631 +++$+++ You know that great thing, though?  Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one.  It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  Or it can just blow you away.  Make you something different in an instant.  It happened to me.
c02468 +++$+++ Oh, baby, what's going on?
c02468 +++$+++ I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
c02468 +++$+++ Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
c15105 +++$+++ Ma -- is she? --
c15105 +++$+++ You'll be a father any minute now.
c15105 +++$+++ Fiddlesticks! She don't hear it. Got better music to listen to than that.  There -- that's what I mean.
c11070 +++$+++ - little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be.
c11070 +++$+++ Are you proud of me, Bill?
c11070 +++$+++ I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
c11070 +++$+++ You shouldn't have had any doubts.
c11070 +++$+++ - after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.
c11070 +++$+++ Is that what you want me to be?
c11070 +++$+++ I'm talking about you. And what you want.
c11070 +++$+++ So am I.
c11070 +++$+++ What have I got to do with it?
c11070 +++$+++ The names I've been called. But never Svengali.  Good luck.
c27179 +++$+++ Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
c27179 +++$+++ What?  President Grant is...!
c27179 +++$+++ I know!  I know!
c27179 +++$+++ I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
c27179 +++$+++ We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
c27179 +++$+++ I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
c27179 +++$+++ Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
c14190 +++$+++ Religion?
c14190 +++$+++ C of E, sir.
c14190 +++$+++ Do you mean Church of England?
c14190 +++$+++ Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
c14190 +++$+++ Brown hair, is it?
c14190 +++$+++ Fair hair, sir.
c14190 +++$+++ Blue eyes?
c14190 +++$+++ Blue eyes, yes, sir.
c14190 +++$+++ No, sir.
c06406 +++$+++ You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
c06406 +++$+++ Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
c06406 +++$+++ And all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
c18634 +++$+++ Did you see that?
c18634 +++$+++ What?
c18634 +++$+++ On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
c18634 +++$+++ That?
c18634 +++$+++ It's disappeared.
c04089 +++$+++ William Taupin seems to have left his mark.
c04089 +++$+++ Yes.
c04089 +++$+++ Yes.
c08817 +++$+++ Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
c08817 +++$+++ I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
c08817 +++$+++ Police, help!  Po-- mmph.
c22433 +++$+++ Let's get us a photo and description. We'll have an APB out while we stake out the restaurant.
c22433 +++$+++ That is a problem. There is no description of Juntao. No known photograph.
c22433 +++$+++ Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
c22990 +++$+++ Ned...I know...I know
c22990 +++$+++ It's good.
c22990 +++$+++ Oh
c22990 +++$+++ The title won't do.
c22990 +++$+++ Ah
c22990 +++$+++ Thank you, Ned.
c06035 +++$+++ So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
c06035 +++$+++ Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
c06035 +++$+++ Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
c06035 +++$+++ You don't know where you're going?
c06035 +++$+++ Well, this is the corner.
c10364 +++$+++ I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
c10364 +++$+++ Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
c10364 +++$+++ This is about sex, not like.  Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  You want a muffin?
c10364 +++$+++ If I can smoke it.
c10364 +++$+++ Donna, you are a muffin.
c12397 +++$+++ Come on in.
c12397 +++$+++ I can explain about the portal, darling.
c12397 +++$+++ Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
c06098 +++$+++ I like your heart and I like your style. You might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git back to that train job.
c06098 +++$+++ I done told the man what he could do with his train.
c06098 +++$+++ Just now.
c27013 +++$+++ - and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
c27013 +++$+++ FAST.
c27013 +++$+++ He just went out like & light-
c11709 +++$+++ I can't resist. You usually move through here so quickly and I have so many questions I want to ask you. You have no idea what your work means to me.
c11709 +++$+++ What's it mean?
c11709 +++$+++ That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
c11709 +++$+++ Aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?
c04444 +++$+++ David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
c04444 +++$+++ Dad, don't start.
c04444 +++$+++ I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
c04444 +++$+++ Three, four. Move on. It's not healthy.
c18770 +++$+++ The kid is amazing.
c18770 +++$+++ No.  A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
c18770 +++$+++ Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
c27024 +++$+++ Just one.  The bar's closed.
c27024 +++$+++ The one time I want it to work...
c27024 +++$+++ You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
c27024 +++$+++ No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
c01050 +++$+++ See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
c01050 +++$+++ Yes...
c01050 +++$+++ Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
c01050 +++$+++ You're on.
c25364 +++$+++ I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
c25364 +++$+++ And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
c25364 +++$+++ It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
c18883 +++$+++ -- You appreciate my writing.
c18883 +++$+++ Yes.
c18883 +++$+++ Will you do me a favor then?
c18883 +++$+++ Another one?
c18883 +++$+++ If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
c18883 +++$+++ What an extraordinary request!
c18883 +++$+++ It's my last and final one.
c18883 +++$+++ Then its authority is in doubt.
c18883 +++$+++ Not necessarily.  A <u>wife</u> would.
c10013 +++$+++ For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
c10013 +++$+++ Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
c10013 +++$+++ No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
c10013 +++$+++ Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
c10013 +++$+++ Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
c14861 +++$+++ So you want to go swimming?
c14861 +++$+++ Dave -- I'm working.
c14861 +++$+++ Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
c14861 +++$+++ Oh. Okay.  I'll catch ya tomorrow then.
c11820 +++$+++ I think we should be going honey.
c11820 +++$+++ What for?
c11820 +++$+++ Why?
c00665 +++$+++ You're a very beautiful girl.
c00665 +++$+++ I thought you were asleep.
c00665 +++$+++ I was. What are you reading?
c00665 +++$+++ 'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
c00665 +++$+++ I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
c01977 +++$+++ No more water, you said.
c01977 +++$+++ Take it.
c01977 +++$+++ No.
c01977 +++$+++ Take it, damn it.
c01977 +++$+++ Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
c22166 +++$+++ Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
c22166 +++$+++ Gonna try.
c22166 +++$+++ Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
c22166 +++$+++ No action.
c22166 +++$+++ Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
c22166 +++$+++ I'm gonna do somethin with it.
c22166 +++$+++ Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
c22166 +++$+++ Same thing. Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together. An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name? -- Gallager -- I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves. An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains --I'd like to lay hands on that bastard. You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid. Whatta you think?
c10674 +++$+++ Professor Tripp?
c10674 +++$+++ Hm.
c10674 +++$+++ How did I get here last night?
c10674 +++$+++ No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
c10674 +++$+++ Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
c02538 +++$+++ It's an apartment.
c02538 +++$+++ Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
c02538 +++$+++ Yeah.
c10890 +++$+++ The convent was built for over fifty. Not many of us left... just us and the chickens.
c10890 +++$+++ How do you survive?
c10890 +++$+++ Oh, we own the land around here. But we rent it out. We keep a few acres for ourselves,  some wheat, corn, some vegetables.
c10890 +++$+++ Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
c10890 +++$+++ Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
c17957 +++$+++ It's not unthinkable.
c17957 +++$+++ What?
c17957 +++$+++ For ten more minutes they love him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and I'm always about ten minutes ahead of the public.
c15015 +++$+++ How's Linda?
c15015 +++$+++ Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
c15015 +++$+++ Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
c04772 +++$+++ Take my advice--grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
c04772 +++$+++ I didn't ask for your advice.
c04772 +++$+++ That's right. You didn't.
c04772 +++$+++ You're not going to notify my father, are you?
c04772 +++$+++ What for?
c04772 +++$+++ If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it.
c04772 +++$+++ I never thought of that.
c04772 +++$+++ Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.
c13236 +++$+++ I- don't know what you're talking about!
c13236 +++$+++ You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
c13236 +++$+++ Wait a minute!  What'd I do?
c13236 +++$+++ I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
c13236 +++$+++ I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
c13236 +++$+++ Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
c13236 +++$+++ Wait a minute - I told you I didn't do nothing wrong!
c13236 +++$+++ I ain't going no place with you!
c03108 +++$+++ Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
c03108 +++$+++ So what's the problem?
c03108 +++$+++ The problem is Murray. He and a few other blocked screenwriters went river rafting down the Kern a few weeks ago. Murray never made it back.
c03108 +++$+++ Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
c22513 +++$+++ Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
c22513 +++$+++ Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
c22513 +++$+++ When you get back, I'll be gone --
c22513 +++$+++ Okay, okay.
c05428 +++$+++ What if you don't make it?
c05428 +++$+++ I'll make it.
c05428 +++$+++ If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
c05428 +++$+++ Why did you take the back roads here?  They're not safe.  You'd know that if you'd planned.
c10549 +++$+++ No.
c10549 +++$+++ What makes you so sure it was one?
c10549 +++$+++ I can't be sure.
c10549 +++$+++ You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
c10549 +++$+++ We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
c10549 +++$+++ Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
c10549 +++$+++ They are much more than that, sir.
c10549 +++$+++ Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
c10549 +++$+++ ... and that you invited him to strike you?  To fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
c04779 +++$+++ Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
c04779 +++$+++ Hurry up and get dressed.
c04779 +++$+++ If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummer--we'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
c23159 +++$+++ -- yeah.
c23159 +++$+++ -- look, you don't have to entertain me...
c23159 +++$+++ Am I entertaining you?
c23159 +++$+++ We're friends.
c23159 +++$+++ -- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
c01013 +++$+++ I could save you the trouble.
c01013 +++$+++ No trouble.
c01013 +++$+++ Always.  Except ...
c03766 +++$+++ Aha!  Hello!  You're Mildred, right?
c03766 +++$+++ I heard you were looking for me.
c03766 +++$+++ You were Harold Ryan's third wife. Right?
c03766 +++$+++ Yes.
c03766 +++$+++ Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
c19797 +++$+++ There's something about him, isn't there?
c19797 +++$+++ Don't tell me you're a believer now?
c19797 +++$+++ Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
c08303 +++$+++ Are you afraid of his reaction? Of his finding you silly for thinking of such things?
c08303 +++$+++ No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
c08303 +++$+++ What upsets you about that?
c08303 +++$+++ I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
c08303 +++$+++ But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
c08303 +++$+++ Yeah, I know.
c08303 +++$+++ Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
c16701 +++$+++ Where's Johnny?
c16701 +++$+++ I tucked him in at Gordo's.
c16701 +++$+++ You give him his drops?
c16701 +++$+++ Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
c08066 +++$+++ Monsters in the gelatin...
c08066 +++$+++ It's a roach, guy --
c08066 +++$+++ Oh, man --
c18035 +++$+++ Would you like to see it?
c18035 +++$+++ I've seen it.
c18035 +++$+++ On the back it has--
c18035 +++$+++ How did you know that?
c20202 +++$+++ Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
c20202 +++$+++ Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
c20202 +++$+++ Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
c20202 +++$+++ Why did you phrase it like that?
c20202 +++$+++ Like what?
c20202 +++$+++ You gotta be kidding.
c03092 +++$+++ Hello? You there?
c03092 +++$+++ Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
c03092 +++$+++ Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
c03092 +++$+++ Okay. So who are you?
c03092 +++$+++ I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
c03092 +++$+++ Who?
c03092 +++$+++ Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
c03092 +++$+++ Maybe that's because you've never been out've fuckin' Miami, dipshit. Maybe it's time you got on a plane, flew out to L.A. and took a meeting with Mr. Zimm.
c21350 +++$+++ We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
c21350 +++$+++ Have the planes made it to China?
c21350 +++$+++ There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
c21350 +++$+++ So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
c21350 +++$+++ God help them.
c05552 +++$+++ Is she... dead?
c05552 +++$+++ No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
c05552 +++$+++ We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
c05552 +++$+++ We'll find it.
c05552 +++$+++ Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
c05552 +++$+++ Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
c05552 +++$+++ Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
c05552 +++$+++ Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
c09833 +++$+++ We're getting close...
c09833 +++$+++ What's that smell?
c09833 +++$+++ Ocean air!
c09833 +++$+++ Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move...  but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
c26317 +++$+++ Now what can I do for you?
c26317 +++$+++ I was hoping we could talk.
c26317 +++$+++ Talk?  About what?
c26317 +++$+++ About things.  About your wife.
c26317 +++$+++ About what you said this morning.
c10518 +++$+++ It's a ninety-one!  It's an 'A'!
c10518 +++$+++ I know.
c10518 +++$+++ You know?  Then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
c10518 +++$+++ This is your moment, don't you see? The instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  When you stand up and are counted.
c14018 +++$+++ Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
c14018 +++$+++ Charlie -
c14018 +++$+++ Yes?
c14018 +++$+++ Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
c14018 +++$+++ Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
c13537 +++$+++ We still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
c13537 +++$+++ Go ahead then.  I'm covering the receiver.  She can't hear.
c13537 +++$+++ First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
c13537 +++$+++ I improved on the fucking original.
c13537 +++$+++ It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
c11406 +++$+++ I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
c11406 +++$+++ I'm going to throw up.
c11406 +++$+++ Really?
c20809 +++$+++ Hi.
c20809 +++$+++ Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
c20809 +++$+++ About ten dollars.
c20809 +++$+++ You can have what I've got. It's right there.
c17862 +++$+++ Ram and I died the day we realized we could never reveal our forbidden love to an uncaring and ununderstanding world. The joy we shared in each other's arms was greater than any touchdown. Yet we were forced to live the lie of Sexist- Beer Guzzling-Jock-Asshole.
c17862 +++$+++ Exquisite, but I don't think ununderstanding is a word.
c17862 +++$+++ We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
c17862 +++$+++ Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
c06829 +++$+++ Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
c06829 +++$+++ My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
c06829 +++$+++ Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
c06829 +++$+++ No, Major, I merely wish to state that your vehicle appears to be somewhat slower and heavier than mine, and point out that, if you would be kind enough to pull over to one side of the road, I could pass you and be on my way.
c06829 +++$+++ May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
c06829 +++$+++ Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
c06829 +++$+++ If you wish to put things on that basis, then I will say good day to you, monsieur.
c05842 +++$+++ Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here?
c05842 +++$+++ You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
c05842 +++$+++ You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
c09395 +++$+++ Are you ready to order?
c09395 +++$+++ Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
c09395 +++$+++ I'll have "pancakes in the Age of Enlightenment".
c26131 +++$+++ They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
c26131 +++$+++ Why?
c26131 +++$+++ This is impressive, gentlemen. Of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
c19103 +++$+++ I was working for you when "us" started, what's--
c19103 +++$+++ I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
c19103 +++$+++ Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
c19103 +++$+++ The somebody else part?
c19103 +++$+++ Else.
c16462 +++$+++ I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
c16462 +++$+++ Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
c16462 +++$+++ I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
c16462 +++$+++ I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.
c13842 +++$+++ We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
c13842 +++$+++ ...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
c13842 +++$+++ Exactly.
c13842 +++$+++ However, you are also non-en-...
c13842 +++$+++ ...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the National Security Act.
c13842 +++$+++ In order to protect those secrets, I am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
c13842 +++$+++ ...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
c13842 +++$+++ I'd say we're about even.
c27214 +++$+++ I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
c27214 +++$+++ Something wrong with buttons?
c27214 +++$+++ Buttons are Hochmut.
c27214 +++$+++ Hochmut?
c27214 +++$+++ Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
c27214 +++$+++ Anything against zippers?
c27214 +++$+++ Quaint? Can't imagine why.
c23980 +++$+++ "Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
c23980 +++$+++ What?
c23980 +++$+++ What are you doing down there?
c23980 +++$+++ My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
c23980 +++$+++ You got a paperclip?
c16010 +++$+++ Nice, huh?
c16010 +++$+++ What?
c16010 +++$+++ The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
c16010 +++$+++ Terrific.
c16010 +++$+++ You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
c12911 +++$+++ You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
c12911 +++$+++ But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
c12911 +++$+++ But how do you know?  Maybe he just wanted to see us?  And now he's gone again.  And you've all killed my father for the second time.
c06603 +++$+++ He played in the town band, too.
c06603 +++$+++ He did? I play the tuba--
c06603 +++$+++ Yeah, I know.
c06603 +++$+++ What did he play?
c06603 +++$+++ The drums. He taught me to play some.
c06603 +++$+++ He did?
c06603 +++$+++ Sure!
c02815 +++$+++ I find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
c02815 +++$+++ Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
c02815 +++$+++ Thanks are hardly necessary.
c02815 +++$+++ Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
c02815 +++$+++ I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
c02815 +++$+++ It ain't for lack of trying.
c02815 +++$+++ Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
c23382 +++$+++ He won't steal. I'm tellin' you he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps to himself.
c23382 +++$+++ Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
c23382 +++$+++ Good to know you, Karl.
c09843 +++$+++ I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
c09843 +++$+++ I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
c09843 +++$+++ Now you and David...
c09843 +++$+++ No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
c09843 +++$+++ No... no, everything's different now...
c25818 +++$+++ Congratulations.
c25818 +++$+++ Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
c25818 +++$+++ He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
c25818 +++$+++ Say, "Thanks very much!"
c25818 +++$+++ I mean if you knew it were stolen.
c25818 +++$+++ Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
c25818 +++$+++ And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
c25818 +++$+++ Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
c08029 +++$+++ Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
c08029 +++$+++ What the fuck is going on.
c08029 +++$+++ What's going ON!!!
c22412 +++$+++ That your gate down there?
c22412 +++$+++ Yes.
c22412 +++$+++ I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
c22412 +++$+++ You take care of yourself, Lee.
c18742 +++$+++ Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
c18742 +++$+++ Look, I don't want a --
c18742 +++$+++ Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.
c11746 +++$+++ Do you have ulcers?
c11746 +++$+++ No.
c11746 +++$+++ Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
c12497 +++$+++ There weren't any shots.
c12497 +++$+++ Then what's...
c12497 +++$+++ It's a heart attack.
c12497 +++$+++ Wha.
c12497 +++$+++ Call the medics, Dude.
c12497 +++$+++ Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping blood.  Might pass out.
c06725 +++$+++ I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
c06725 +++$+++ Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
c06725 +++$+++ It's just a thought.
c01893 +++$+++ How long have you been married?
c01893 +++$+++ Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
c01893 +++$+++ So you decided to go to America.
c01893 +++$+++ Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
c01893 +++$+++ Yes, I'll bet.
c01893 +++$+++ He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
c01893 +++$+++ Does he know that?
c01893 +++$+++ Oh, yes.
c01893 +++$+++ And he is still willing to give you a visa?
c01893 +++$+++ Yes, Monsieur.
c01893 +++$+++ And you want to know --
c01893 +++$+++ He always has.
c00990 +++$+++ Nature ...
c00990 +++$+++ ... preserve...
c00990 +++$+++ Secret ...
c00990 +++$+++ ... love...
c00990 +++$+++ Hope...
c00990 +++$+++ ... love ...
c00990 +++$+++ Fear ...
c00990 +++$+++ Peter ...
c12744 +++$+++ Right on.
c12744 +++$+++ G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
c12744 +++$+++ Stoned?
c12744 +++$+++ I wish there was shit like this back home.
c12744 +++$+++ Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money I could make if I had this stuff back east?
c21522 +++$+++ Nothing will grow here .... there's just a trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates.
c21522 +++$+++ Any sign of dangerous ionization?
c21522 +++$+++ Okay. If there's no life here, we've got just seventy-two hours to find it. That's when the groceries run out.
c07410 +++$+++ Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
c07410 +++$+++ I don't know.
c07410 +++$+++ You are down for protecting Malcolm's widow aren't you?
c07410 +++$+++ Yeah... let me think about it.
c07410 +++$+++ No man. Gonna walk.
c25513 +++$+++ What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
c25513 +++$+++ He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
c25513 +++$+++ She could tell you where father is.
c14374 +++$+++ Here, Captain.
c14374 +++$+++ Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
c14374 +++$+++ Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
c14374 +++$+++ Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
c14374 +++$+++ I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
c14374 +++$+++ Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
c14374 +++$+++ Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
c05910 +++$+++ Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
c05910 +++$+++ Actually, sir--
c05910 +++$+++ Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
c05910 +++$+++ All the time, sir.
c05910 +++$+++ Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
c13127 +++$+++ Look at that. Tell me that's a crazy person. Every move is calculated. He knows exactly what he's doing. This is the guy. I've been after him for weeks. He's quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
c13127 +++$+++ Okay, whatta I do?
c13127 +++$+++ If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
c13127 +++$+++ That's ridiculous.
c13127 +++$+++ You learn that in the army?
c10245 +++$+++ Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
c10245 +++$+++ Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
c10245 +++$+++ I'm afraid that's not possible.
c10245 +++$+++ We haven't implanted it yet.
c14048 +++$+++ I just saw Alyssa's little sister outside. She was with Rick Derris.
c14048 +++$+++ Let's not talk about that. How'd you get home?
c14048 +++$+++ I can't believe you're here.
c27148 +++$+++ You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?
c27148 +++$+++ Oh, for Christ's sake.
c27148 +++$+++ Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
c15999 +++$+++ Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
c15999 +++$+++ I thought maybe held gotten over that.
c15999 +++$+++ Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
c20732 +++$+++ Come on back to bed.
c20732 +++$+++ Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
c20732 +++$+++ Just a minute.
c10557 +++$+++ Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
c10557 +++$+++ No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
c10557 +++$+++ Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
c10557 +++$+++ I don't mean your head head - I'm not gonna piss on your head - your hair an' all... Just piss in the toilet. Y'all take a listen - here a deep sound comin' down from Bobby Peru.
c00451 +++$+++ Do you have to be so brutal?
c00451 +++$+++ Yes
c00451 +++$+++ Why? Do you enjoy it?
c00451 +++$+++ How can you? I mean they're people.
c06032 +++$+++ Yes.
c06032 +++$+++ What is it?
c06032 +++$+++ Not you. I want Ricky to answer.
c09393 +++$+++ But most important, man, I'm sorry about what I said. I was drunk... My adrenaline was going...
c09393 +++$+++ Don't sweat it, man. I needed a kick in the ass. We're better friends for it.
c09393 +++$+++ Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
c17444 +++$+++ Gone--  --over to your Uncle John's. The whole crowd of 'em, two weeks ago. But they can't stay there either, because John's got *his* notice to get off.
c17444 +++$+++ But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
c17444 +++$+++ Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
c17444 +++$+++ But who done it?
c17444 +++$+++ Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
c17444 +++$+++ Are you crazy?
c17444 +++$+++ That's what I asked you, ain't it?
c00907 +++$+++ Milo?
c00907 +++$+++ My friend, my best friend, Teddy, was killed in Silicon Valley.
c00907 +++$+++ My goodness.
c00907 +++$+++ It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
c00907 +++$+++ If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
c00907 +++$+++ I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
c00907 +++$+++ Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
c00907 +++$+++ 'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
c00907 +++$+++ Yes sir.
c07479 +++$+++ Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
c07479 +++$+++ Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
c07479 +++$+++ You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
c03200 +++$+++ Aren't there a million places like this?
c03200 +++$+++ This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
c03200 +++$+++ SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
c03570 +++$+++ Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
c03570 +++$+++ Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
c03570 +++$+++ Oh, no.
c03570 +++$+++ Why not?
c03570 +++$+++ I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
c03570 +++$+++ It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:  'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.
c00771 +++$+++ Everybody in?
c00771 +++$+++ I guess so.
c00771 +++$+++ Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
c25594 +++$+++ You're going to blow yourselves up.
c25594 +++$+++ Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
c25594 +++$+++ If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
c25916 +++$+++ Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
c25916 +++$+++ No, I'm too hot now.
c25916 +++$+++ You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
c25916 +++$+++ Gideon, don't say things like that.
c08596 +++$+++ Something happened, didn't it?
c08596 +++$+++ Yes, it did.
c08596 +++$+++ Are you wigging out?
c08596 +++$+++ Yes, I am.
c08596 +++$+++ We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
c08596 +++$+++ What happened?
c10582 +++$+++ Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
c10582 +++$+++ But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
c10582 +++$+++ How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
c04844 +++$+++ Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a vacation here from your accounting business in New York, you had drinks and, under the influence discussed killing Kennedy, is that not so?
c04844 +++$+++ I did.
c04844 +++$+++ Why?
c04844 +++$+++ Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
c04844 +++$+++ Well, you see, I've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948, when I was in Korea...
c01467 +++$+++ Yeah.
c01467 +++$+++ Bryant here.  Regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, Esper's concluded that the only irregular category that Tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  You better get on it.
c01467 +++$+++ If you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  I got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  Good luck.
c14358 +++$+++ Hi.
c14358 +++$+++ Hi.
c14358 +++$+++ I'm assuming you read my deposition.
c14358 +++$+++ Pretty ironic, huh?  I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
c06669 +++$+++ Why, that's an echo, sir!
c06669 +++$+++ You try it.
c06669 +++$+++ Yeah.
c04826 +++$+++ Yeah--the "big boy"--the Boss of the outfit.
c04826 +++$+++ You're not kidnapping her, are you?
c04826 +++$+++ What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
c04826 +++$+++ Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see--and--
c04826 +++$+++ What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
c04826 +++$+++ But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with--
c04826 +++$+++ Sh-sh-sh--! Soft pedal, you mug!--before I-- What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing--and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
c04826 +++$+++ I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
c04826 +++$+++ You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
c00587 +++$+++ What are you doing here?
c00587 +++$+++ Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
c00587 +++$+++ Why you?
c00587 +++$+++ I was at hand.
c00587 +++$+++ Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
c00587 +++$+++ He needs me, ma'am.
c00587 +++$+++ No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
c00587 +++$+++ And I'm asking you -
c22552 +++$+++ How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
c22552 +++$+++ It plays in 50 states.
c22552 +++$+++ What?!
c22552 +++$+++ You're right.  You better hope so.
c19735 +++$+++ What the hell can I do?
c19735 +++$+++ What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
c19735 +++$+++ If I were?
c19735 +++$+++ I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
c07879 +++$+++ It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
c07879 +++$+++ What time is it?
c07879 +++$+++ Nine o'clock.
c07879 +++$+++ At night?
c07879 +++$+++ Yeah. At night.
c07879 +++$+++ How many pounds I gotta lose?
c07879 +++$+++ Three more, I figure.
c07879 +++$+++ Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
c07879 +++$+++ Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
c11286 +++$+++ Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
c11286 +++$+++ All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
c11286 +++$+++ All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
c25110 +++$+++ Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
c25110 +++$+++ One or two kilometers.
c25110 +++$+++ Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
c25110 +++$+++ We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
c16983 +++$+++ I mean, what for?
c16983 +++$+++ That's what I was wondering.
c16983 +++$+++ Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
c16983 +++$+++ Why would it?
c16983 +++$+++ It just would. He was always the same.
c16983 +++$+++ Since when did he drink whisky?
c16983 +++$+++ Nobody seems to know.
c22106 +++$+++ Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
c22106 +++$+++ Quiet.
c22106 +++$+++ Oh, no.
c14179 +++$+++ And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
c14179 +++$+++ Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
c14179 +++$+++ Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
c21214 +++$+++ We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
c21214 +++$+++ No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
c21214 +++$+++ But does it have to be in a cemetery?
c21214 +++$+++ You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
c21214 +++$+++ But there're so many wonderful things to write about, Bob.
c21214 +++$+++ Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
c21214 +++$+++ Shirley, I wrote for years without selling a single word.
c03662 +++$+++ I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
c03662 +++$+++ And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
c03662 +++$+++ No.
c12888 +++$+++ I don't know. Please...
c12888 +++$+++ I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
c12888 +++$+++ No. Don't do this.
c12888 +++$+++ Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
c04005 +++$+++ Isn't it?
c04005 +++$+++ That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
c04005 +++$+++ Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
c04005 +++$+++ How many tickets can I put you down for?
c04005 +++$+++ None.  Christ!
c04005 +++$+++ You're not even coming?
c04005 +++$+++ Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
c04005 +++$+++ Bitter?  Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk.  Just keep that out of my window.
c16955 +++$+++ What about the brakes?
c16955 +++$+++ Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
c16955 +++$+++ How'd it happen, then?
c16955 +++$+++ Was he?
c19294 +++$+++ We're building up tourism, Sam--
c19294 +++$+++ People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
c19294 +++$+++ You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
c03537 +++$+++ Bless you...
c03537 +++$+++ Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
c03537 +++$+++ I can't.
c03537 +++$+++ No?
c03537 +++$+++ No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
c03537 +++$+++ Why do you think --
c03537 +++$+++ They've brought me such good luck -- you --
c25328 +++$+++ Why did you kill Friedman?
c25328 +++$+++ Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. It's wrong. Fucking wrong.
c25328 +++$+++ Why did you kill him?
c25328 +++$+++ Huh! You turned him into a liability, didn't you know?
c25328 +++$+++ That's just it. The sonofabitch didn't ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasn't gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
c10807 +++$+++ You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
c10807 +++$+++ You don't need to know the details of this mission... you're better off if you don't.
c10807 +++$+++ Mrs. Brigman, you're becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  I believe the stress is affecting you.  Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a tranquilizer.
c12261 +++$+++ ... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
c12261 +++$+++ I have no idea...
c12261 +++$+++ Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
c12261 +++$+++ Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
c12261 +++$+++ Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
c12261 +++$+++ I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
c12261 +++$+++ Of course, Doctor, I understand.
c12261 +++$+++ Certainly, glad to be of help.
c15649 +++$+++ He's arrogant and threatening. Voice stress points suggest he's worrying.
c15649 +++$+++ Hiding something?
c15649 +++$+++ Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
c25970 +++$+++ Why does he need money?
c25970 +++$+++ He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
c25970 +++$+++ Nine thousand dollars.
c08751 +++$+++ I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
c08751 +++$+++ Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
c08751 +++$+++ Not this time.
c26211 +++$+++ They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
c26211 +++$+++ Do tell. Why drug related?
c26211 +++$+++ Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
c26211 +++$+++ No shit?
c26211 +++$+++ Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
c26211 +++$+++ Nope.
c26211 +++$+++ If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
c26211 +++$+++ Who is he?
c26211 +++$+++ Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
c26211 +++$+++ Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
c04651 +++$+++ Jeff, call the FBI right away...
c04651 +++$+++ They do this with impunity!
c04651 +++$+++ They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
c23261 +++$+++ Stay away from me!
c23261 +++$+++ Why?
c23261 +++$+++ Why?
c11364 +++$+++ What's the matter?
c11364 +++$+++ I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
c11364 +++$+++ Well, sit down.
c11364 +++$+++ Oh, Jesus.
c11364 +++$+++ You all right?
c11364 +++$+++ I don't know, I mean, I-
c11364 +++$+++ You wanna lie down?
c11364 +++$+++ No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
c11364 +++$+++ Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
c18766 +++$+++ Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
c18766 +++$+++ Uh, not today, but --
c18766 +++$+++ John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
c18766 +++$+++ Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the "coin."  It's the...
c26772 +++$+++ ... illegal search of Lindenmeyer' s duplex. Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed. Twenty--four citizen complaints. And the calls are just starting to come in...  I forgot what it's like to have you on the streets.
c26772 +++$+++ Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
c26772 +++$+++ None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
c26772 +++$+++ In other words, we collectively don't know shit.
c16370 +++$+++ Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
c16370 +++$+++ This is crazy.
c16370 +++$+++ Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
c16370 +++$+++ Surprise me.
c20214 +++$+++ A visit from an old friend.
c20214 +++$+++ What's happening here?  You're dead!
c20214 +++$+++ Fatigued, certainly.  But dead is a little extreme.  On the other hand, when me dear Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live.
c20214 +++$+++ You are infected with <i>Chimera,</i> my friend.
c03831 +++$+++ What are you doing here?
c03831 +++$+++ I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
c03831 +++$+++ Do the police want to arrest me?
c03831 +++$+++ Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
c03831 +++$+++ Yeah, sure.
c03831 +++$+++ Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
c03831 +++$+++ You sure as hell haven't been any help.
c03831 +++$+++ I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
c03831 +++$+++ Why don't you tell me something for a change?
c03831 +++$+++ Who is Ratan?
c23297 +++$+++ Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
c23297 +++$+++ The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
c23297 +++$+++ Am I?
c06209 +++$+++ Hey, Herbie...
c06209 +++$+++ What?
c06209 +++$+++ Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
c22876 +++$+++ I have to go now.
c22876 +++$+++ Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
c22876 +++$+++ Nah, I don't think so...
c22876 +++$+++ Don't hang up on me.
c22876 +++$+++ Don't...
c08609 +++$+++ Bitch.
c08609 +++$+++ Slut.
c08609 +++$+++ Tramp.
c22538 +++$+++ I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
c22538 +++$+++ I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
c22538 +++$+++ Who is this?
c22538 +++$+++ Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
c04353 +++$+++ Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
c04353 +++$+++ Whaddya been so far?
c04353 +++$+++ Eddie, you're a born loser.
c04353 +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
c04353 +++$+++ First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
c04353 +++$+++ I told you. I got drunk.
c04353 +++$+++ Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
c04353 +++$+++ Thanks for the drink.
c04353 +++$+++ Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
c04353 +++$+++ To do what?
c04353 +++$+++ Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
c04353 +++$+++ Why?
c04353 +++$+++ Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
c04353 +++$+++ Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
c04353 +++$+++ Seventy-five per cent.
c04353 +++$+++ For who?
c04353 +++$+++ For me.
c04353 +++$+++ That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
c04353 +++$+++ How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
c04353 +++$+++ You think I can lose?
c04353 +++$+++ I never saw you do anything else.
c04353 +++$+++ You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
c04353 +++$+++ Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
c04353 +++$+++ Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
c04353 +++$+++ I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
c04353 +++$+++ Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
c04353 +++$+++ Kiss off.
c01337 +++$+++ What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
c01337 +++$+++ Leave him!
c01337 +++$+++ No I haven't.
c02130 +++$+++ So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
c02130 +++$+++ Nice car.
c02130 +++$+++ She's my baby.
c02130 +++$+++ How long have you worked at the casino?
c02130 +++$+++ Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
c02130 +++$+++ Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
c08329 +++$+++ I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
c08329 +++$+++ You told Ann about this?
c08329 +++$+++ Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
c08329 +++$+++ I wish you hadn't done that.
c08329 +++$+++ Why not?
c08329 +++$+++ It's just something I'd prefer she didn't know about.
c08329 +++$+++ She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
c08329 +++$+++ I just... Ann is very...
c08329 +++$+++ Hung up.
c08329 +++$+++ It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
c08329 +++$+++ No.
c08329 +++$+++ You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
c08329 +++$+++ It won't. I trust him.
c08329 +++$+++ You trust him.
c08329 +++$+++ Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
c08329 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c08329 +++$+++ Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
c08329 +++$+++ It hurts that you would say that to me.
c08329 +++$+++ Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
c08329 +++$+++ By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
c08329 +++$+++ That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
c08329 +++$+++ Look, are we going to do it or not?
c08329 +++$+++ Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
c08329 +++$+++ How about straightening up the living room?
c19669 +++$+++ Sire!  I -- How did you --
c19669 +++$+++ How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
c19669 +++$+++ A letter.  May I see?
c05089 +++$+++ What are you doing?!!
c05089 +++$+++ If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
c05089 +++$+++ No.
c04251 +++$+++ Yeah, I know where that is, it's right by my house. It's Dr. Satan's tree. I can show ya.
c04251 +++$+++ Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
c04251 +++$+++ Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
c04251 +++$+++ Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
c04251 +++$+++ Maybe, maybe, maybe... hey, you know what word I hate?
c04251 +++$+++ What?
c04251 +++$+++ Cone.
c04251 +++$+++ Huh... what cone?
c04251 +++$+++ Any cone, yeah...  I hate that word... sounds ugly, I don't like crumple either.
c04251 +++$+++ I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous.
c11403 +++$+++ I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
c11403 +++$+++ Hardly...
c11403 +++$+++ I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
c06086 +++$+++ So whenever we want...
c06086 +++$+++ Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
c06086 +++$+++ So you're our own private guy?
c06086 +++$+++ I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
c06086 +++$+++ You know my pager number?
c06086 +++$+++ No. What is it?
c06086 +++$+++ The 'job?' Alls I know is I'm taking you to the Soho Grand.
c00761 +++$+++ What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
c00761 +++$+++ Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
c00761 +++$+++ Well, he was making love to her.
c03144 +++$+++ Lufkin. His... agent.
c03144 +++$+++ Yeah, Karen knows him.
c03144 +++$+++ I'm intrigued, yeah. You know what might help you, take a look at the Cylone again, the way a visual fabric is maintained even while the metaphor plays on different levels. Hey --  This your ride, Chili?
c02206 +++$+++ Max something.  I got no clue where she stays.
c02206 +++$+++ Any idea when she'll be back?
c02206 +++$+++ I'll wait.
c01334 +++$+++ Yeah it was okay.
c01334 +++$+++ Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
c01334 +++$+++ The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
c14147 +++$+++ Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
c14147 +++$+++ I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
c14147 +++$+++ Where?
c14147 +++$+++ It doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
c14147 +++$+++ You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
c14147 +++$+++ Like I said, I can't turn it off.
c14147 +++$+++ And I can't leave.
c14147 +++$+++ If it's alright, I'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
c14147 +++$+++ Jess--you look good.
c12533 +++$+++ Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
c12533 +++$+++ It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
c12533 +++$+++ This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
c00260 +++$+++ I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
c00260 +++$+++ Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
c00260 +++$+++ Because...
c17255 +++$+++ Any more, O -- ?
c17255 +++$+++ You guys are through...
c17255 +++$+++ Whatcha got left ... ?
c17255 +++$+++ "Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
c17255 +++$+++ We'll take it...
c17255 +++$+++ We'll take it.
c19576 +++$+++ I love you.  I love you and I'm sick.  I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow.  I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  For my teeth.  For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm getting braces, too.  For you.  For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money.  And I don't have any money now but I'II get it...I will for you, Brad.  I love you, Brad.  Brad the Bartender.  You wanna love me back?  Love me back and I'll be good to you.  I'II be god damn good for you. And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson.
c19576 +++$+++ Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
c19576 +++$+++ You mind your own bussines.
c19576 +++$+++ Gently, son --
c19576 +++$+++ Brad, I know you don't love me now --
c19576 +++$+++ -- and you wanna know the common element for the entire group, like he asks...I'll tell you the answer: I'll tell you, 'cause I had that question.  I had that same question....Carbon. In pencil led, it's in the form of graphite and in coal, it's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form.  "Well...all we were asking was the common element, Donnie...but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, Kids!  Full of useless thoughts, eh?"  Thank you. Thank you.  And the book says: "We may be through with the past but the past is not through with us."  And NO IT'S NOT DANGEROUS TO DO THAT.
c13813 +++$+++ Yeah.
c13813 +++$+++ I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.
c13813 +++$+++ Yes. He asked me to come over and talk to you.
c15471 +++$+++ what?
c15471 +++$+++ Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
c15471 +++$+++ No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
c15471 +++$+++ I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
c15471 +++$+++ What kind of person?
c13019 +++$+++ Sir...
c13019 +++$+++ What's that?
c13019 +++$+++ Enhance it.
c03956 +++$+++ This is what began it.
c03956 +++$+++ A box?
c03956 +++$+++ It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
c03956 +++$+++ Let me see.
c03956 +++$+++ Don't touch it. It's dangerous. It opens doors.
c03956 +++$+++ What kind of doors?
c03956 +++$+++ To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
c03956 +++$+++ Hell...
c03956 +++$+++ I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
c03956 +++$+++ And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
c03956 +++$+++ Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
c03956 +++$+++ Who did?
c03956 +++$+++ The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
c03956 +++$+++ You're still afraid.
c03956 +++$+++ You would be. They tore me apart.
c03956 +++$+++ No. They gave me experiences beyond the limits. Pain and pleasure, indivisible.
c10253 +++$+++ Why not?
c10253 +++$+++ A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
c10253 +++$+++ Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
c04042 +++$+++ Don't forget your CDs.
c04042 +++$+++ Those aren't mine.
c04042 +++$+++ Sure they are.
c04042 +++$+++ They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
c04042 +++$+++ Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
c04042 +++$+++ I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
c04042 +++$+++ I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
c04042 +++$+++ You're being deliberately obtuse.
c04042 +++$+++ Well, think about it.
c21939 +++$+++ Yes indeed. He has been a <U>difficult</U> case. Now that <U>you</U> have him in custody--you have him haven't you?
c21939 +++$+++ Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
c21939 +++$+++ Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
c21939 +++$+++ Do you have many patients, doctor?
c21939 +++$+++ Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
c07605 +++$+++ Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
c07605 +++$+++ Been where?
c07605 +++$+++ To Old Madrid.
c07605 +++$+++ Never even been to New Madrid.
c07605 +++$+++ Then how do you expect to write about it?
c07605 +++$+++ Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
c03374 +++$+++ Oh!  You're here.
c03374 +++$+++ What have you got, Egon?
c03374 +++$+++ Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
c06407 +++$+++ Where the hell are you going?
c06407 +++$+++ Unfinished business.
c06407 +++$+++ Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
c17120 +++$+++ Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times.
c17120 +++$+++ You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
c17120 +++$+++ We were all upset about that.
c17120 +++$+++ C'mon, I see what I can do.
c15633 +++$+++ Gentlemen--
c15633 +++$+++ This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
c15633 +++$+++ Who would do that?
c15633 +++$+++ Maybe Bellmoth. Maybe the unions. I don't know.
c15633 +++$+++ Well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.
c15633 +++$+++ You're firing me.
c15633 +++$+++ A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
c15633 +++$+++ Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
c15633 +++$+++ Fuck off.
c20324 +++$+++ Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
c20324 +++$+++ How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
c20324 +++$+++ King of the WHO?
c20324 +++$+++ The Britons.
c20324 +++$+++ All of us are ... we are all Britons.
c02401 +++$+++ What's this?
c02401 +++$+++ The main spire.
c02401 +++$+++ ...I learned a long time ago.
c26179 +++$+++ Yes.
c26179 +++$+++ You will?
c26179 +++$+++ You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
c07490 +++$+++ You?!
c07490 +++$+++ Me!
c07490 +++$+++ No, I'm -- rescuing you.
c12122 +++$+++ How are you feeling, young man?
c12122 +++$+++ Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
c12122 +++$+++ Old habits die hard. Are you alright?
c12122 +++$+++ Dick has run away. They have taken Dr. Meridian. And I'm afraid they found the cave, sir. It's been destroyed.
c13347 +++$+++ Where's Ebby?
c13347 +++$+++ Ain't he warning up?
c13347 +++$+++ Better find our bonus baby, eh?
c21502 +++$+++ Fry?
c21502 +++$+++ Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
c21502 +++$+++ So what, we should both go down too? Out of sheer fucking nobility?
c25469 +++$+++ She coulda killed me last night.
c25469 +++$+++ Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
c25469 +++$+++ Who are you?
c25469 +++$+++ Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
c25469 +++$+++ Don't have much choice, do ya?
c12865 +++$+++ And did you?
c12865 +++$+++ I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
c12865 +++$+++ Why did you stop?
c12865 +++$+++ My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
c12865 +++$+++ Do you miss it?
c12865 +++$+++ You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
c21341 +++$+++ How'd you get this?
c21341 +++$+++ Boxin'.
c21341 +++$+++ Yes'm.
c24445 +++$+++ Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
c24445 +++$+++ Then come with me.
c24445 +++$+++ Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
c24445 +++$+++ You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
c24445 +++$+++ Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
c09315 +++$+++ Agent Mackelway, you're going to get your wish. You're going back to Washington. I want you back in Computer Crimes. Fire up those chat rooms.
c09315 +++$+++ This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
c09315 +++$+++ If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
c14149 +++$+++ Gabe!?
c14149 +++$+++ What are you doing here!?
c14149 +++$+++ Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
c14149 +++$+++ How'd you get up here?
c14149 +++$+++ Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
c14149 +++$+++ Where's Hal, what's going on?
c13492 +++$+++ Tony.
c13492 +++$+++ Hey.
c13492 +++$+++ How you doin'?
c13492 +++$+++ How you doin'?
c13492 +++$+++ All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
c13492 +++$+++ What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
c13492 +++$+++ I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
c13492 +++$+++ You sure?
c13492 +++$+++ I'm positive.
c13492 +++$+++ Well, I'm a little confused here.
c13492 +++$+++ You're a little confused?
c13492 +++$+++ Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you'll - you'll get unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money!
c00966 +++$+++ Not a good time to lose one's head.
c00966 +++$+++ Indeed.
c00966 +++$+++ That's not the way to get ahead in life.
c00966 +++$+++ Yes.
c00966 +++$+++ It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
c00966 +++$+++ Fair enough.
c20621 +++$+++ Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
c20621 +++$+++ It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
c20621 +++$+++ Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
c20621 +++$+++ No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
c16945 +++$+++ How's Mama and the kids?
c16945 +++$+++ Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
c16945 +++$+++ My lady'11 come in in about five minutes. Have some food sent up in half an hour.
c16945 +++$+++ Right.
c22997 +++$+++ A woman of property?
c22997 +++$+++ She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
c22997 +++$+++ And your relations?
c22997 +++$+++ On my mother's side the Ardens
c22997 +++$+++ No, your marriage bed.
c22997 +++$+++ Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
c22997 +++$+++ yet cannot love nor write it.
c18866 +++$+++ Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
c18866 +++$+++ This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
c18866 +++$+++ Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
c18229 +++$+++ Joey?
c18229 +++$+++ Not quite.
c18229 +++$+++ JP?
c18229 +++$+++ What do you want?
c11346 +++$+++ Alvy.
c11346 +++$+++ Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
c11346 +++$+++ This is my room.
c11346 +++$+++ Can I confess something?
c23535 +++$+++ Suppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks?
c23535 +++$+++ Hey, Joe!
c23535 +++$+++ Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
c00622 +++$+++ I have come to commission work from you.
c00622 +++$+++ What work?
c00622 +++$+++ A Mass for the dead.
c00622 +++$+++ What dead? Who is dead?
c00622 +++$+++ A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
c00622 +++$+++ Who are you?
c00622 +++$+++ How much?
c18405 +++$+++ So you have the answers...
c18405 +++$+++ Ah! You have questions?
c18405 +++$+++ What are we?
c18405 +++$+++ Nothing if not vampires...
c18405 +++$+++ Who made us what we are?
c18405 +++$+++ But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
c04721 +++$+++ He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
c04721 +++$+++ Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
c04721 +++$+++ He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
c04721 +++$+++ I have no idea what Howard Doyle eats. I'm not a damn dietician.
c04721 +++$+++ Did Marylin end up with money?
c04721 +++$+++ I don't have a pre-nup
c16520 +++$+++ You're leaving?
c16520 +++$+++ Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
c16520 +++$+++ You were going without saying goodbye?
c16520 +++$+++ I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
c16520 +++$+++ I'll say goodbye to you, Tita.
c09624 +++$+++ Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
c09624 +++$+++ Good to meet you.  Again.
c09624 +++$+++ Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
c09624 +++$+++ Thanks.
c09624 +++$+++ And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
c09624 +++$+++ We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
c09624 +++$+++ I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
c09624 +++$+++ Well, he loves the place.  It's his home.
c09624 +++$+++ Luke, I'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation. I'll come to the point.  I want to buy the property, and I'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars for it.  And that's just for the property, mind you.  If you want, I'll leave it to you and your father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has, and you keep those proceeds.  I just want the land.
c09624 +++$+++ That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
c09624 +++$+++ The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
c09624 +++$+++ You think it over.  No reason to risk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building.
c22673 +++$+++ Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
c22673 +++$+++ But, sir...
c22673 +++$+++ There you go again, that's whining, that's not okay.
c22673 +++$+++ That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.
c10690 +++$+++ I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
c10690 +++$+++ I thank you.
c10690 +++$+++ I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
c18485 +++$+++ Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
c18485 +++$+++ In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
c18485 +++$+++ I had a notion you had become self--appointed chaperone lately -- why?
c18485 +++$+++ You are my friend.
c18485 +++$+++ And I'm your friend ---- but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
c18485 +++$+++ If I told you ---- you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you ---- the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone ---
c18485 +++$+++ That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle ---
c18485 +++$+++ When you make sense I'll listen.
c22125 +++$+++ Feeling
c22125 +++$+++ Like I'm outside in the rain
c22125 +++$+++ Wheeling
c22125 +++$+++ Free to try and find a game
c22125 +++$+++ Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
c26738 +++$+++ You alright?
c26738 +++$+++ Yeah. I'm thinking about Micheal's Franco Harris fixation. You know how Micheal was always harping "Immaculate Reception?" I've seen that play. A lot of times...and I have to say this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, right place, right time. That's it. He was where the ball bounced. You get me?
c26738 +++$+++ I guess.
c26738 +++$+++ I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
c26738 +++$+++ That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's figured it out. There is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. Spends all our money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. After fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off the belt. He comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. We all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." Fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. Not one dog ate Pup Corn. Not one. Three months later, "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. My father never got over it. Never.
c25120 +++$+++ You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
c25120 +++$+++ I have a job.
c25120 +++$+++ This? This is a joke.  I'll give your group a thousand bucks.
c25120 +++$+++ You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine.
c25120 +++$+++ Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
c25120 +++$+++ Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong.
c27038 +++$+++ I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
c27038 +++$+++ Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
c27038 +++$+++ Why bother to ask, Ro...?  Why don't you just make me stay,..?
c27038 +++$+++ Stop it!
c27038 +++$+++ You bastard!
c22675 +++$+++ You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
c22675 +++$+++ Maybe.
c22675 +++$+++ It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
c22675 +++$+++ Since when have things been normal?
c22675 +++$+++ You got me.  Afraid of bad news?
c22675 +++$+++ Good news?
c20186 +++$+++ How're we doin', then?
c20186 +++$+++ He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
c20186 +++$+++ Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
c17707 +++$+++ Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
c17707 +++$+++ Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
c17707 +++$+++ I--How was I to know?!  Everyone was pointing back here.
c18808 +++$+++ What kind of gun is that?
c18808 +++$+++ My father's .600 Nitro Express.  Made in 1904.  Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant.  8700 foot pound striking force.
c18808 +++$+++ How close do you have to be?
c18808 +++$+++ Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill?
c04115 +++$+++ Oh please.  Another one.
c04115 +++$+++ What would you like?
c04115 +++$+++ Like you.
c15339 +++$+++ So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
c15339 +++$+++ No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
c15339 +++$+++ Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
c11586 +++$+++ Two whole drums --
c11586 +++$+++ We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
c11586 +++$+++ I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
c16143 +++$+++ What's on your mind?
c16143 +++$+++ Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
c16143 +++$+++ I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
c16143 +++$+++ Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
c25349 +++$+++ I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
c25349 +++$+++ You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
c25349 +++$+++ No...
c25349 +++$+++ No.  But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
c18268 +++$+++ ...The people look like ants.
c18268 +++$+++ Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
c18268 +++$+++ What a beautiful thought.
c18268 +++$+++ What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
c18268 +++$+++ Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
c18268 +++$+++ Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
c18268 +++$+++ Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
c18268 +++$+++ That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
c18268 +++$+++ Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
c02434 +++$+++ Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
c02434 +++$+++ REALLY?
c02434 +++$+++ And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
c23682 +++$+++ Hey Cartman.
c23682 +++$+++ What?
c23682 +++$+++ Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
c05846 +++$+++ I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
c05846 +++$+++ Well, what do you know about that!
c05846 +++$+++ Found in Asia!
c05846 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c05846 +++$+++ When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
c05846 +++$+++ Not at all.
c04559 +++$+++ Yeah...You've fallen for her.
c04559 +++$+++ I told you, I have a feeling...
c04559 +++$+++ I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
c05908 +++$+++ Well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
c05908 +++$+++ For instance...  It says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
c05908 +++$+++ We're the government, Cowan.
c00524 +++$+++ Your name wouldn't happen to be Porter, would it?
c00524 +++$+++ Uh, Matthew...
c00524 +++$+++ Back off, George.
c00524 +++$+++ I'll handle it.
c04598 +++$+++ He can't help us.
c04598 +++$+++ Do something!
c04598 +++$+++ Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
c04598 +++$+++ You are, I've seen you.
c04598 +++$+++ It wasn't me. It was him.
c04598 +++$+++ It was you.
c04598 +++$+++ But you did it. It was you.
c16034 +++$+++ What're you doing down here?
c16034 +++$+++ Celebrating.  Join me?
c16034 +++$+++ No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
c08232 +++$+++ What did she want?
c08232 +++$+++ I did her hair.
c08232 +++$+++ What were you talking about?
c08232 +++$+++ Nothing.
c08232 +++$+++ Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
c08232 +++$+++ She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
c08232 +++$+++ And that was all?
c08232 +++$+++ No. She asked about the trademark.
c08232 +++$+++ What did she want to know?
c08232 +++$+++ You	fool! That symbol is us -- us. She was asking about us.
c01938 +++$+++ I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
c01938 +++$+++ I slept very well.
c01938 +++$+++ That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
c01938 +++$+++ May we proceed with the business?
c01938 +++$+++ Thank you.
c12193 +++$+++ Ah... He certainly has something, sir.
c12193 +++$+++ Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
c12193 +++$+++ Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
c12193 +++$+++ Glad to hear it.  Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?
c12193 +++$+++ Sack him?  David, what else can I do?  This business is not, repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this morning?
c24526 +++$+++ If you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. Just what are you up to?
c24526 +++$+++ Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
c24526 +++$+++ Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
c06980 +++$+++ We may have a chance.
c06980 +++$+++ Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
c06980 +++$+++ All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
c08743 +++$+++ Not a very happy poem.
c08743 +++$+++ You didn't look very happy.
c08743 +++$+++ I wasn't.
c08743 +++$+++ Better.
c16292 +++$+++ How ya doin', Wade?
c16292 +++$+++ What's goin' on there?
c16292 +++$+++ Oh, nothing, Wade. How ya doin' there?
c16292 +++$+++ Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
c16292 +++$+++ No kiddin'?
c16292 +++$+++ We might be innarested.
c16292 +++$+++ No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
c16292 +++$+++ Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
c16292 +++$+++ 2:30.
c14919 +++$+++ Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
c14919 +++$+++ Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
c14919 +++$+++ Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
c14919 +++$+++ What's his specialty, brown-nosing?
c10061 +++$+++ Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
c10061 +++$+++ Nepal? Have you been?
c10061 +++$+++ Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
c10061 +++$+++ You own a home there?
c10061 +++$+++ Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
c10061 +++$+++ Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.
c19997 +++$+++ Yeah.
c19997 +++$+++ So you have information for me?
c19997 +++$+++ Is that what your little note says?
c19997 +++$+++ Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear.
c16931 +++$+++ When we had trouble before it was different.
c16931 +++$+++ You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
c16931 +++$+++ What do you want to do?
c16931 +++$+++ Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
c16931 +++$+++ I mean it.
c20678 +++$+++ I never forgot that.
c20678 +++$+++ It's two weeks.
c20678 +++$+++ That is so romantic.
c01189 +++$+++ What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me?
c01189 +++$+++ No.
c01189 +++$+++ Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece.
c12301 +++$+++ Please, sir.
c12301 +++$+++ I've never ridden in an automobile.
c12301 +++$+++ I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
c12301 +++$+++ Very good.
c20045 +++$+++ You know how improbable this is...?
c20045 +++$+++ "Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
c20045 +++$+++ ...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
c20045 +++$+++ That's right.
c20045 +++$+++ Exactly.
c16134 +++$+++ You picked a helluva day to leave your beeper off!
c16134 +++$+++ What happened?
c16134 +++$+++ Escaped?  From Erewhon?  I want everyone on this -- our entire force and the SFPD.
c16456 +++$+++ You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
c16456 +++$+++ Well did you or didn't you?
c16456 +++$+++ Well, I guess I'll come back then.
c20369 +++$+++ No look, really, this isn't nescess ...
c20369 +++$+++ We must examine you.
c20369 +++$+++ Please ... we are doctors.
c05790 +++$+++ What's beyond this place -- do you know?
c05790 +++$+++ No, no, no
c05790 +++$+++ Never, never, ever. Nothing.
c10525 +++$+++ You taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
c10525 +++$+++ They don't know that.  We were the only one's on deck. Look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  I'm a kid.
c10525 +++$+++ That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
c04035 +++$+++ And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
c04035 +++$+++ Nothing.
c04035 +++$+++ We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
c04035 +++$+++ Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
c04035 +++$+++ Will you call me?
c04035 +++$+++ I don't have your number.
c04035 +++$+++ You do, huh.
c20096 +++$+++ Dad...I'm...
c20096 +++$+++ ...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
c20096 +++$+++ Yeah. How's Mom?
c20096 +++$+++ Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
c20096 +++$+++ Same. None of the neighbors know. We told them you were in a hospital in Europe.  Oh... this is Stanley Davis. He's the American Consul here... And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
c05219 +++$+++ I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
c05219 +++$+++ Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright?  But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos.
c05219 +++$+++ I can't believe I agreed to do this.
c05219 +++$+++ Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
c22328 +++$+++ I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
c22328 +++$+++ It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
c22328 +++$+++ I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
c22328 +++$+++ No we're not.
c01368 +++$+++ Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
c01368 +++$+++ Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
c01368 +++$+++ The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
c01368 +++$+++ Thank Christ for that.
c01368 +++$+++ You are pretty naive if you think it is.
c01368 +++$+++ I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
c01368 +++$+++ Well what have you got?
c25478 +++$+++ Twist?  I told him the tale.  He wants to see ya.
c25478 +++$+++ All right, when?
c25478 +++$+++ Okay, Tootsie.
c19072 +++$+++ Well, you can try talking them into that, if--
c19072 +++$+++ I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  And I think I know a way to--
c19072 +++$+++ Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
c17616 +++$+++ Come on Rachel!
c17616 +++$+++ Coming.
c17616 +++$+++ I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
c25853 +++$+++ Run for your lives, boys!  It's That great two-gun dog-catcher From Kansas!
c25853 +++$+++ McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
c25853 +++$+++ Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
c25853 +++$+++ Well in that case, I saw your Horse.  Billy Clanton was takin' Him up to the Cut to show him Off.  The boys're all up there Right now, branding.  And in a Mood.  Still want your property Back, Mr. Private Citizen?
c02414 +++$+++ Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
c02414 +++$+++ Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
c02414 +++$+++ Yes sir.  What's that?
c02414 +++$+++ A dressing bag.
c02414 +++$+++ Very smart indeed.
c02414 +++$+++ Yes. John wants it.
c02414 +++$+++ A dressing bag?
c02414 +++$+++ You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
c02414 +++$+++ John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
c09782 +++$+++ Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
c09782 +++$+++ Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
c09782 +++$+++ Sure we did! He wasn't there but we went to see him. And Mr. Carpenter showed him how to do his arithmetic.
c22253 +++$+++ Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
c22253 +++$+++ Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
c22253 +++$+++ You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
c22253 +++$+++ Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
c22253 +++$+++ Too great oppression for a tender thing.
c22253 +++$+++ If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
c06166 +++$+++ [Yeah.  Yes.]
c06166 +++$+++ [Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
c06166 +++$+++ [Her life for your life.]
c08296 +++$+++ Who? Elizabeth?
c08296 +++$+++ Yes.
c08296 +++$+++ You mean you're still in contact with her?
c08296 +++$+++ No.
c08296 +++$+++ But you're planning to be?
c08296 +++$+++ I don't know. Possibly.
c08296 +++$+++ Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
c08296 +++$+++ Not entirely.
c08296 +++$+++ But that was part of it?
c08296 +++$+++ Yes.
c08296 +++$+++ Like maybe a big part?
c08296 +++$+++ Possibly.
c08296 +++$+++ Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
c08296 +++$+++ I don't know.
c08296 +++$+++ Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
c08296 +++$+++ I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
c08296 +++$+++ Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
c08296 +++$+++ Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
c21896 +++$+++ Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
c21896 +++$+++ With the forty thousand dollars?
c21896 +++$+++ He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
c21896 +++$+++ Like what?
c21896 +++$+++ Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions!  I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
c21896 +++$+++ He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
c14578 +++$+++ Who are you?  Why is the Green Destiny in your possession?
c14578 +++$+++ What's it to you?
c14578 +++$+++ My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
c14578 +++$+++ I'm just playing around.
c14578 +++$+++ Let's go!
c26362 +++$+++ You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
c26362 +++$+++ Cause she's dead.
c26362 +++$+++ Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
c26362 +++$+++ I've had time to get over it.
c26362 +++$+++ You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
c26362 +++$+++ Oz.
c26362 +++$+++ You're too quick for me.
c11249 +++$+++ Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
c11249 +++$+++ It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
c11249 +++$+++ Uncle Terrence.
c11249 +++$+++ Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
c11249 +++$+++ Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
c15957 +++$+++ What did you do today?
c15957 +++$+++ Um........Stuff.
c15957 +++$+++ Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
c12788 +++$+++ You'll be sorry?
c12788 +++$+++ I was angry.
c12788 +++$+++ You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
c12788 +++$+++ I suggest it never happened.
c03247 +++$+++ Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
c03247 +++$+++ You're late, asshole.
c03247 +++$+++ Did you bring that tape?
c01261 +++$+++ You hated West, Mueller loved him --
c01261 +++$+++ Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
c01261 +++$+++ Bullshit.
c01261 +++$+++ Look in my pack.
c01261 +++$+++ Just look. Little pocket.
c23435 +++$+++ You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
c23435 +++$+++ I knew he slept in a toolshed.
c23435 +++$+++ His mother told him that he was their punishment. Hers and his father's; from God, for having sex--
c23435 +++$+++ Before they were married?
c23435 +++$+++ I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
c23435 +++$+++ One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I imagine. Y'all pull up a chair. I'll go out and talk to him.
c21580 +++$+++ You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
c21580 +++$+++ This must have cost a fortune.
c21580 +++$+++ It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
c21580 +++$+++ It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
c06301 +++$+++ Good morning, Colonel.
c06301 +++$+++ Morning, Radar. How were things?
c06301 +++$+++ Morning, Captain.
c15654 +++$+++ Yes?
c15654 +++$+++ Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
c15654 +++$+++ Federal Express?
c15654 +++$+++ For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
c15654 +++$+++ The door was open, sir. I just need a signature.
c14195 +++$+++ Are you referring to the background score?
c14195 +++$+++ Yes!!!
c14195 +++$+++ Yes!!!
c03568 +++$+++ Can you pay some attention to me?
c03568 +++$+++ Oh, yes.
c03568 +++$+++ Insolent young cub!
c03568 +++$+++ You mean Baron von Gaigern?
c03568 +++$+++ Well, he's a gentleman!
c11719 +++$+++ Michael?
c11719 +++$+++ No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
c11719 +++$+++ What?
c20382 +++$+++ Checked and locked, sir.
c20382 +++$+++ Louder, girl!
c20382 +++$+++ Kitchen and lower house.
c10204 +++$+++ Yes, Sergeant?
c10204 +++$+++ Remember one thing.
c10204 +++$+++ Sir?
c10204 +++$+++ Yes sir!
c25024 +++$+++ What was it?
c25024 +++$+++ When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
c25024 +++$+++ What killed those men?
c25024 +++$+++ What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
c25024 +++$+++ I'll know soon enough.
c25024 +++$+++ What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
c25024 +++$+++ A plague?
c25024 +++$+++ The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
c25024 +++$+++ Negotiating with whom?
c25024 +++$+++ I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
c25024 +++$+++ Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
c14177 +++$+++ You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.
c14177 +++$+++ Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
c14177 +++$+++ I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
c14177 +++$+++ It will be your own torture. I hope to God it will torture you to madness.
c14268 +++$+++ The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line.  They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
c14268 +++$+++ Motive?
c14268 +++$+++ He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
c14268 +++$+++ Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
c02842 +++$+++ Rich old ladies and their daughters?
c02842 +++$+++ Can you think of a better reason?
c02842 +++$+++ Do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
c03528 +++$+++ Please do not be frightened, Madam.
c03528 +++$+++ What do you want here?
c03528 +++$+++ Nothing -- only to be here.
c03528 +++$+++ Why do you hide in my room?
c03528 +++$+++ Because you love me -- you love me?
c18041 +++$+++ Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
c18041 +++$+++ I like my work.
c18041 +++$+++ We'll see.
c18238 +++$+++ How.
c18238 +++$+++ You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
c18238 +++$+++ Ooh-kay...
c24186 +++$+++ Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
c24186 +++$+++ Yes?
c24186 +++$+++ Under a condition red alert, the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops.
c24186 +++$+++ I am aware of what a condition red alert implies.
c24186 +++$+++ Well, sir, they may not allow the Special Service troops to enter the base.
c24186 +++$+++ Thank you, sir.  But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?
c03503 +++$+++ Can I talk to you a minute?
c03503 +++$+++ Sure.
c03503 +++$+++ Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
c03503 +++$+++ What?
c03503 +++$+++ Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
c03503 +++$+++ When I go off?
c03503 +++$+++ No, I do. I want to tell you.
c21172 +++$+++ Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
c21172 +++$+++ You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
c21172 +++$+++ He had a few birds.  I got up and fed 'em this morning.
c21172 +++$+++ That was nice of you.
c21172 +++$+++ I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
c21172 +++$+++ I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested --in pigeons.
c21172 +++$+++ I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
c21172 +++$+++ The things that go on.
c21172 +++$+++ Oh she's a beauty.
c21527 +++$+++ Landon! Join the expedition.
c21527 +++$+++ Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
c21527 +++$+++ Air leak. Died in her sleep.
c21527 +++$+++ You don't seem very cut up about it.
c21527 +++$+++ It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
c21527 +++$+++ By our time.  You've turned gray.
c06624 +++$+++ You can't come up here!
c06624 +++$+++ Let me go! I wanna see him!
c06624 +++$+++ He's not home, I tell you!
c06624 +++$+++ I wanna see that guy!
c06624 +++$+++ Let me go!
c12257 +++$+++ ... Were you going somewhere?
c12257 +++$+++ No, Robert.
c12257 +++$+++ ... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
c12257 +++$+++ Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
c12257 +++$+++ ... Oh? You've heard?
c12257 +++$+++ Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
c12257 +++$+++ He does, does he?
c12257 +++$+++ Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
c12257 +++$+++ How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
c05634 +++$+++ I wish you had told me then.
c05634 +++$+++ I'm telling you now.
c05634 +++$+++ I gave up on you.
c05634 +++$+++ I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
c05634 +++$+++ What would you be doing now?
c05634 +++$+++ Getting high, I guess.
c05634 +++$+++ If I asked you to stop, would you?
c05634 +++$+++ I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
c05634 +++$+++ Don't be.  And hide whatever that new drug is you have.  I like it.
c16202 +++$+++ Ben --
c16202 +++$+++ Oh, you remember my name do you?  You happen to remember what you <u>swore</u> to do with every breath in your body?
c16202 +++$+++ Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
c24511 +++$+++ This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
c24511 +++$+++ Yes?
c24511 +++$+++ Sentimental idiot.
c10642 +++$+++ So. Is he any good?
c10642 +++$+++ No. Not yet he isn't.
c10642 +++$+++ Well, I'm going to read it anyway.
c10642 +++$+++ Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
c10642 +++$+++ He is. Take my word for it.
c10642 +++$+++ On the contrary, it could be just the ticket.
c13394 +++$+++ Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on suspension.
c13394 +++$+++ Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 'sir'.
c13394 +++$+++ Well, sir, I was just...
c13394 +++$+++ Why is she eight pounds over?
c13394 +++$+++ ...trying to offer you the respect that your...
c13394 +++$+++ I...
c13394 +++$+++ ...position...
c13394 +++$+++ 'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
c13394 +++$+++ Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
c13394 +++$+++ She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
c13394 +++$+++ ...and she doesn't always -
c13394 +++$+++ ...all you do is give me answers. Just - just give me the right answer.
c13394 +++$+++ But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
c13394 +++$+++ That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
c13394 +++$+++ No. Just stop everything.
c01279 +++$+++ This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
c01279 +++$+++ The very same.
c01279 +++$+++ You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
c01279 +++$+++ I plan to grow on you.
c01279 +++$+++ So noted.
c14860 +++$+++ What do you mean by that?
c14860 +++$+++ Just what you think I mean.
c14860 +++$+++ Sort of... Yeah.
c17810 +++$+++ No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
c17810 +++$+++ Then we cannot go.
c17810 +++$+++ Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
c10739 +++$+++ This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it.  You believe in fairy tales?
c10739 +++$+++ Fairy tales?
c10739 +++$+++ Do you believe in them?
c10739 +++$+++ No.
c10739 +++$+++ Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
c10739 +++$+++ Woodsman?
c10739 +++$+++ The one with the ax?
c10739 +++$+++ I don't know.
c10739 +++$+++ Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
c10739 +++$+++ That's it. Little Red Riding Hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch.  Ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half?
c01130 +++$+++ I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
c01130 +++$+++ They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
c01130 +++$+++ She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
c07373 +++$+++ -- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --
c07373 +++$+++ Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
c07373 +++$+++ No cars.  Feet are faster.
c07373 +++$+++ How many more do we have after this?
c07373 +++$+++ This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
c13267 +++$+++ I didn't say it was a bad idea, I just said the timing was off.  We could maybe wait till later.
c13267 +++$+++ Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
c13267 +++$+++ Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
c13267 +++$+++ You're the boss, boss.  I just thought maybe we should wait.
c15667 +++$+++ I'm impressed you can sew.
c15667 +++$+++ Good.
c15667 +++$+++ You sew very badly.
c15667 +++$+++ You don't sew at all!
c15667 +++$+++ That makes it harder still.
c03055 +++$+++ Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
c03055 +++$+++ I think I heard that.
c03055 +++$+++ It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
c03055 +++$+++ Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
c15797 +++$+++ But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
c15797 +++$+++ They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
c15797 +++$+++ So what made you think it was?
c15797 +++$+++ It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
c15797 +++$+++ What medical records?
c15797 +++$+++ The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
c15797 +++$+++ Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
c04155 +++$+++ I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
c04155 +++$+++ Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
c04155 +++$+++ Ts! Ts! Ts!
c04155 +++$+++ And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
c04155 +++$+++ I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
c04155 +++$+++ That's the kind of stuff they want!
c12864 +++$+++ You ought to write these stories down.
c12864 +++$+++ Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
c12864 +++$+++ "Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
c12864 +++$+++ I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
c12864 +++$+++ Why, do you think?
c12864 +++$+++ I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
c12864 +++$+++ You sound like an artist.
c12864 +++$+++ I don't think you're normal.
c14198 +++$+++ One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was. The boys stop and applaud him.
c14198 +++$+++ Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers? Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.
c14198 +++$+++ Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
c14198 +++$+++ It's a stinking world because there's no law and order any more. It's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you done. It's no world for an old man any more. What sort of a world is it at all? Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and there's not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more. The Tramp starts singing again.
c17233 +++$+++ He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
c17233 +++$+++ What kind of job... ?
c17233 +++$+++ A boost? What's Kip doing on a boost?
c13345 +++$+++ I gotta go now, Dad.
c13345 +++$+++ I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.
c13345 +++$+++ No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
c13345 +++$+++ We'll be praying for you.
c13345 +++$+++ Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
c13345 +++$+++ If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it.  I gotta run--
c08367 +++$+++ I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
c08367 +++$+++ Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
c08367 +++$+++ Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
c08367 +++$+++ I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line.
c16408 +++$+++ Biology, mostly.
c16408 +++$+++ Why?
c16408 +++$+++ What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
c19469 +++$+++ Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
c19469 +++$+++ And what am I supposed to say to the man?
c19469 +++$+++ The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
c19469 +++$+++ I was just showing emotion.
c18179 +++$+++ Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?
c18179 +++$+++ My wife. Where were we?
c18179 +++$+++ Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness.
c02797 +++$+++ Pretty morning.
c02797 +++$+++ It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
c02797 +++$+++ Yes.
c22310 +++$+++ Thanks for the loan, man.  I'll have it in a few days, I promise.
c22310 +++$+++ Well I hope so.  That pretty much cleaned me out.
c22310 +++$+++ I hear you.
c00790 +++$+++ Distracting enough for you?
c00790 +++$+++ Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
c00790 +++$+++ So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
c00790 +++$+++ Mm-hmm.
c00790 +++$+++ Such as?
c00790 +++$+++ You could have worn one of those big, floppy woman's Easter Sunday hats.
c00790 +++$+++ That would have made an impression.
c00790 +++$+++ I figure.
c00790 +++$+++ No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
c07094 +++$+++ It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
c07094 +++$+++ Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
c07094 +++$+++ It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's change -- which is a fact of history. Even that old cocksucker Hoover's dead.  Things change.
c10850 +++$+++ I'm being punished.
c10850 +++$+++ Why?
c10850 +++$+++ Dear Jesus...
c06117 +++$+++ But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
c06117 +++$+++ How old are you, Betty?
c06117 +++$+++ There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
c06117 +++$+++ Are you?
c06117 +++$+++ And dogged when I set my mind to something.
c06117 +++$+++ Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.
c16785 +++$+++ What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
c16785 +++$+++ Never.
c16785 +++$+++ You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
c16785 +++$+++ I'm sorry to hear that.  A famous man once said -- there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted.
c05695 +++$+++ We'll just get off at the next stop.
c05695 +++$+++ Say what?
c05695 +++$+++ That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
c05695 +++$+++ We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
c02275 +++$+++ Time is running out. We have to go see Grandma Death. We have to talk to her.
c02275 +++$+++ Why? Is this about the book?
c02275 +++$+++ Who's Frank?
c09235 +++$+++ We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
c09235 +++$+++ Was there visual contact?
c09235 +++$+++ It could have been anything.
c13629 +++$+++ It's her, isn't it?
c13629 +++$+++ What's her?
c13629 +++$+++ She's the thing you had to tell me.
c13629 +++$+++ I'm sorry, you know that? I'm really sorry.
c16302 +++$+++ Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
c16302 +++$+++ Yah, woulda been cold out here.
c16302 +++$+++ Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
c16302 +++$+++ No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
c10126 +++$+++ Adlai's too weak! We have to convince Jack to pull him, get McCloy in there.
c10126 +++$+++ You can't take him out this late in the game.
c10126 +++$+++ Zorin will eat him alive!
c10126 +++$+++ What's gotten into you?
c11585 +++$+++ You're out of your skull --
c11585 +++$+++ We have a lot of pride in our unit --
c11585 +++$+++ How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
c11585 +++$+++ Esprit de corps --
c11585 +++$+++ No -- absolutely not --
c11585 +++$+++ You can keep your fucking fuel --
c08294 +++$+++ If you were in love with me, would you?
c08294 +++$+++ I'm not in love with you.
c08294 +++$+++ But if you were?
c08294 +++$+++ I... I can't answer that precisely.
c08294 +++$+++ But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
c08294 +++$+++ That's very flattering.
c08294 +++$+++ So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
c08294 +++$+++ I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
c26044 +++$+++ You Only Live Twice?
c26044 +++$+++ Nineteen-sixty-seven.
c26044 +++$+++ Running time?
c26044 +++$+++ One hundred and sixteen minutes.
c26044 +++$+++ Director?
c26044 +++$+++ Lewis Gilbert.
c26044 +++$+++ Screenwriter?
c26044 +++$+++ Eh - Ian Fleming?
c26044 +++$+++ Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
c26044 +++$+++ You can look it up.
c11343 +++$+++ Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
c11343 +++$+++ Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
c11343 +++$+++ Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
c11343 +++$+++ Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
c11343 +++$+++ What?
c11343 +++$+++ We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
c11343 +++$+++ Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
c11343 +++$+++ You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
c11343 +++$+++ Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
c11343 +++$+++ I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh, Eisenhower... Impeach Nixon... Impeach Lyndon Johnson... Impeach Ronald Reagan.
c16109 +++$+++ Fine work, Jon.
c16109 +++$+++ Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
c16109 +++$+++ I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
c16109 +++$+++ ... Thanks.
c16109 +++$+++ Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
c06927 +++$+++ John's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
c06927 +++$+++ Mm-hm.
c06927 +++$+++ I'll tell you a secret.
c06927 +++$+++ Yes?
c06927 +++$+++ I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
c06927 +++$+++ Yes?
c06927 +++$+++ Now it's your turn.
c06927 +++$+++ What secret shall I tell?
c06927 +++$+++ That's no secret. I'm five.
c05328 +++$+++ Did you see his face?
c05328 +++$+++ No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
c05328 +++$+++ I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
c05328 +++$+++ Okay.  Why don't you go out there. We'll check in with you later.
c13412 +++$+++ You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...
c13412 +++$+++ ...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
c13412 +++$+++ Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
c04896 +++$+++ Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
c04896 +++$+++ I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
c04896 +++$+++ But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
c04896 +++$+++ I know. That's why I went.
c04896 +++$+++ Sure, 'cause I didn't ask her if I could go.
c24550 +++$+++ Boy!
c24550 +++$+++ Gets you where you live, huh?
c24550 +++$+++ It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
c23263 +++$+++ Stay away from me!  Please...
c23263 +++$+++ Stop swinging the bat.
c23263 +++$+++ Stay away from me.
c23263 +++$+++ Put the bat down, Wendy.
c23263 +++$+++ Stop it!
c23263 +++$+++ Wendy give me the bat.
c23263 +++$+++ Give me the bat.
c05969 +++$+++ I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
c05969 +++$+++ Rufus.  She's a precog.
c05969 +++$+++ That's right.
c12652 +++$+++ I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
c12652 +++$+++ First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
c12652 +++$+++ I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
c12652 +++$+++ Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
c12652 +++$+++ Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
c06191 +++$+++ Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
c06191 +++$+++ Dyslexic?
c06191 +++$+++ Like St. Jude. A hopeless case that has a complete block about 'C' Minor. But remember, "Whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." New Testament, Romans 13.
c06191 +++$+++ You'll be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
c25925 +++$+++ As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
c25925 +++$+++ You must have done something to her.
c25925 +++$+++ Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
c25925 +++$+++ Hattie is a different person now.
c25925 +++$+++ I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
c25925 +++$+++ I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
c25925 +++$+++ Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
c01105 +++$+++ Are you still here?
c01105 +++$+++ Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
c01105 +++$+++ Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
c01105 +++$+++ Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
c06874 +++$+++ I remember you...in the elevator.
c06874 +++$+++ That's right.
c06874 +++$+++ It was because I had this...in my pocket
c12427 +++$+++ You remember your price, Stamp?
c12427 +++$+++ Never found out.
c12427 +++$+++ I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
c12427 +++$+++ No use thinking these things now.
c12427 +++$+++ Oh but we got to. How we gonna know our price in the future? How are children's children's children gonna know what they cost? Who's gonna tell them? What are they gonna pay for us, if we free?
c12427 +++$+++ Children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.
c12427 +++$+++ They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
c12427 +++$+++ There was a rooster named Mister down at Sweet Home. Last time I saw Halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, I saw Mister - sitting on a tub. He loved that tub. Like king on a throne. He was a hateful thing. Bloody and evil..But he was better than me.  Mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. Even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named Mister. But wasn't no way I'd ever be Paul D. again..Schoolteacher changed me. Was never no beating under Mr. Garner. Schoolteacher changed that. Why wouldn't a man run from that? Why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? And it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else. And that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.
c06139 +++$+++ It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
c06139 +++$+++ Murder.
c06139 +++$+++ -- there is a serious question as to whether --
c06139 +++$+++ These are my children. Mine. And they ain't no question. None.
c06139 +++$+++ I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
c06139 +++$+++ All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
c06139 +++$+++ Get out.
c06139 +++$+++ Your control over your children, therefore --
c06139 +++$+++ Did you hear me?!
c06139 +++$+++ If you don't move out through that door, you're going to be past all regretting.
c08856 +++$+++ Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
c08856 +++$+++ I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
c08856 +++$+++ It is.
c08856 +++$+++ What exactly is he charged with?
c08856 +++$+++ He is a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
c25665 +++$+++ You guys seem pretty tight.
c25665 +++$+++ We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
c25665 +++$+++ I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things...
c06297 +++$+++ What's going on? Who started this?
c06297 +++$+++ You mean who hit who?
c06297 +++$+++ I did. First and only blow. So far.
c17280 +++$+++ You think it can be done?
c17280 +++$+++ Are you considering a comeback tour?
c17280 +++$+++ Tell me...
c17280 +++$+++ It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
c17280 +++$+++ The hard part ...
c17280 +++$+++ "A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
c17280 +++$+++ Is he still working here ?
c17280 +++$+++ I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
c04875 +++$+++ I'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.
c04875 +++$+++ Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
c04875 +++$+++ Take a look across the street.
c12729 +++$+++ Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
c12729 +++$+++ She did that before.
c12729 +++$+++ No.  These are her first steps.  Watch her.
c12729 +++$+++ Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
c12729 +++$+++ But this is...
c12729 +++$+++ I said, I've seen it before.
c12729 +++$+++ Alright.
c12729 +++$+++ Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.
c12729 +++$+++ Out.
c23301 +++$+++ Don't look at your feet, and I don't want to see anybody counting.  Make it look easy.  Again!
c23301 +++$+++ Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
c23301 +++$+++ Hopeless I
c23301 +++$+++ Amateurs 2
c23301 +++$+++ Again!
c26080 +++$+++ Their equipment is primitive but effective. I recommend we land at Coordinate 8563.
c26080 +++$+++ That puts us pretty far away from Paradise City.
c26080 +++$+++ Mr. Sulu. Execute.
c15970 +++$+++ Hello Regan. I'm a friend of your mother, I'd like to help you.
c15970 +++$+++ You might loosen the straps then.
c15970 +++$+++ I'm affraid you might hurt yourself Regan.
c15970 +++$+++ I'm not Regan.
c15970 +++$+++ I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
c15970 +++$+++ And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
c15970 +++$+++ If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
c15970 +++$+++ That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
c15970 +++$+++ Where's Regan?
c15970 +++$+++ Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps.
c00751 +++$+++ What time did this thing happen?
c00751 +++$+++ The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
c00751 +++$+++ All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
c00751 +++$+++ Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
c10915 +++$+++ I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
c10915 +++$+++ You're what?
c10915 +++$+++ If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you.
c10915 +++$+++ One that will ask the questions you want asked.
c10915 +++$+++ One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
c10915 +++$+++ For the Church?
c10915 +++$+++ For Agnes.
c10915 +++$+++ You think she's a saint?
c10915 +++$+++ She's been touched by God, yes.
c10915 +++$+++ How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
c10915 +++$+++ The father!
c10915 +++$+++ Who is he?
c10915 +++$+++ Why must he be anybody?
c10915 +++$+++ My God, you're as crazy as...
c10915 +++$+++ Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
c10915 +++$+++ How  ?
c10915 +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous.
c10915 +++$+++ Well give me a reasonable explanation
c10915 +++$+++ A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
c10915 +++$+++ This is insane.
c10915 +++$+++ You're saying God did it?
c21985 +++$+++ Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
c21985 +++$+++ Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
c21985 +++$+++ Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
c21985 +++$+++ Aw, be a good sport, Rose.  You like me, don't you? I like you a lot.
c11361 +++$+++ Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
c11361 +++$+++ Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
c11361 +++$+++ Max, the city is terribly worried.
c11361 +++$+++ But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
c11361 +++$+++ No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
c11361 +++$+++ Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
c11361 +++$+++ Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
c25713 +++$+++ Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
c25713 +++$+++ Then I mislay my checkbook--
c25713 +++$+++ Then you use the wrong lipstick--
c25713 +++$+++ And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
c25713 +++$+++ It's disgraceful!
c25713 +++$+++ Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
c25713 +++$+++ Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
c25713 +++$+++ Ye-es?
c25713 +++$+++ And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
c25713 +++$+++ What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
c25713 +++$+++ You're hired!
c00195 +++$+++ What do you think?
c00195 +++$+++ I think you better put him on ice, man.
c00195 +++$+++ If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
c09938 +++$+++ You died, Starks. Years ago, in the hospital.
c09938 +++$+++ I know. [Beat] You killed me, didn't you?
c09938 +++$+++ I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
c08052 +++$+++ What'd you tell that casino manager?
c08052 +++$+++ Nnn... nothing...
c08052 +++$+++ You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
c08052 +++$+++ Nothing... I promise-nothing...
c08052 +++$+++ NO!
c25413 +++$+++ No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
c25413 +++$+++ That makes a change.
c25413 +++$+++ You know what we do? We use psychology.
c25413 +++$+++ We use what?
c25413 +++$+++ We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
c25413 +++$+++ Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
c25413 +++$+++ Just shut up.
c07484 +++$+++ You've got sand, for a maid.
c07484 +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
c07484 +++$+++ And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
c07484 +++$+++ Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
c07484 +++$+++ No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
c07484 +++$+++ It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
c07345 +++$+++ Want me to get a towel?
c07345 +++$+++ I'll get it if you want.
c07345 +++$+++ I don't want you to move.
c07345 +++$+++ They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
c17988 +++$+++ Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
c17988 +++$+++ I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
c17988 +++$+++ Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
c17988 +++$+++ Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
c17988 +++$+++ There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
c12292 +++$+++ He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
c12292 +++$+++ Yes, Ben - he is.
c12292 +++$+++ I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
c06893 +++$+++ Meet Irene.
c06893 +++$+++ Hi.
c06893 +++$+++ Thank you.
c11766 +++$+++ How to make a buck!
c11766 +++$+++ Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
c11766 +++$+++ Because it's in English?
c11766 +++$+++ Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
c11766 +++$+++ No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
c08688 +++$+++ He's giving them up?
c08688 +++$+++ All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
c08688 +++$+++ That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
c25172 +++$+++ He's shy, not like Enzo.
c25172 +++$+++ Yes.  Not like Enzo.
c25172 +++$+++ ... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
c11765 +++$+++ So how's your work?
c11765 +++$+++ It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
c11765 +++$+++ Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
c11765 +++$+++ I don't know, I don't care. I see too much of him and he's changed. He used to be busy at the magazine. But now he's been doing nothing for months, like he doesn't care about anything, including me.
c11765 +++$+++ Well, he sure seems fired up all of a sudden.
c11765 +++$+++ I don't know, maybe I'll enrol for postgrad' studies next Autumn.
c05112 +++$+++ Right.
c05112 +++$+++ Do you see the kids?
c05112 +++$+++ Probably out in the back yard.
c05112 +++$+++ In Amity, you say 'Yahd.'
c05112 +++$+++ The kids are in the yahd, playing near the cah. How's that sound?
c05112 +++$+++ Give me 30 years, I'll get it.
c17736 +++$+++ Well, why don't you share them with us?
c17736 +++$+++ I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
c17736 +++$+++ That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
c17736 +++$+++ No, he hasn't.  If I offended you, I'm sorry.
c09637 +++$+++ You think he's drunk somewhere?
c09637 +++$+++ Wouldn't blame him if he was.
c09637 +++$+++ Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
c09637 +++$+++ Thirty a month.
c13075 +++$+++ Mother? Is that you?
c13075 +++$+++ Of course. Isn't it wonderful? The bandages came of this afternoon. Come and join the fun. Everybody's here.
c13075 +++$+++ Is Mr Helpmann here?
c13075 +++$+++ I want to talk to him.
c03011 +++$+++ Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
c03011 +++$+++ Only answers to me.
c03011 +++$+++ But I'm the Commander!
c03011 +++$+++ C'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.
c11592 +++$+++ Chef.
c11592 +++$+++ Yes, sir --
c11592 +++$+++ Why they call you that?
c11592 +++$+++ Call me what, sir?
c11592 +++$+++ Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
c11592 +++$+++ No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
c11592 +++$+++ A sauciere --
c11592 +++$+++ That's right, sir -- I come from New Orleans -- I was raised to be a sauciere.. a great sauciere. We specialize in sauces; my whole family. It's what we do. I was supposed to go to Paris and study at the Escoffier School; I was saving the money. They called me for my physical so I figured the Navy had better food.
c11592 +++$+++ What are you doing out here?
c11592 +++$+++ Cook school -- that did it.
c11592 +++$+++ They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
c21282 +++$+++ Oh, God...
c21282 +++$+++ I called your room from downstairs.
c21282 +++$+++ If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
c21282 +++$+++ Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
c21282 +++$+++ It would be worth the risk.
c03259 +++$+++ Yeah, sure... very funny....
c03259 +++$+++ Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us...  Please?
c03259 +++$+++ I - I'd really rather not...
c03259 +++$+++ We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
c03259 +++$+++ I don't think so...
c03259 +++$+++ PLEASE? We have to!
c03259 +++$+++ Fine, I'll go by myself then...
c11219 +++$+++ Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
c11219 +++$+++ Don't you want me to?
c11219 +++$+++ Okay!
c07625 +++$+++ What?
c07625 +++$+++ It doesn't matter.
c07625 +++$+++ No. I want to know.
c07625 +++$+++ Ah.
c10884 +++$+++ Martha, you have to make a decision on her sanity as quickly as possible and not interfere with due process of law.
c10884 +++$+++ No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
c10884 +++$+++ The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
c10884 +++$+++ Why?
c10884 +++$+++ And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
c15155 +++$+++ What?
c15155 +++$+++ When I'm bein' fucked, I like to be kissed a lot.  Who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  You're a city cop, where's the FBI?  This is a federal offense, I got kidnapping, armed robbery, they're gonna bury me!  You know it, you can't talk for them, you're some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  Now God damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
c15155 +++$+++ Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
c12017 +++$+++ Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
c12017 +++$+++ It was an accident.
c12017 +++$+++ You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
c12017 +++$+++ Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
c26322 +++$+++ I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
c26322 +++$+++ Is the job done?
c26322 +++$+++ No.
c26322 +++$+++ You didn't kill her?
c26322 +++$+++ The time wasn't right.
c26322 +++$+++ You're out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time wasn't right?  What's the matter?  You were hoping to get it on home video?  A keepsake for the grandkids.  Thank God I waited, or I never would have gotten it on tape.
c26322 +++$+++ You know what I mean.
c26322 +++$+++ I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
c26322 +++$+++ You know so much about killing why don't you do it yourself?
c26322 +++$+++ I guess I have what you'd call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
c26322 +++$+++ You love her, but you hate her?
c26322 +++$+++ I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
c26322 +++$+++ Shut up.
c26322 +++$+++ Came close this time and it scares you.
c26322 +++$+++ Drop it, Jake.
c26322 +++$+++ SHUT UP!
c09644 +++$+++ Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
c09644 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c09644 +++$+++ Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
c09644 +++$+++ What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
c14848 +++$+++ Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
c14848 +++$+++ ... Alright.
c14848 +++$+++ `Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
c14471 +++$+++ I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
c14471 +++$+++ Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
c14471 +++$+++ That settles it. I'm never leaving.
c14471 +++$+++ I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
c14471 +++$+++ Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
c17337 +++$+++ Excuse me. Is this the buildings and grounds office?
c17337 +++$+++ Yeah, can I help you?
c17337 +++$+++ I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
c17337 +++$+++ No students work for me.
c17337 +++$+++ Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
c17337 +++$+++ Building two.
c23684 +++$+++ You're late, Cartman!
c23684 +++$+++ I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
c23684 +++$+++ Your behind?
c23684 +++$+++ I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
c23684 +++$+++ No you guys... Something happened... You guys wanna hear something creepy?  I don't think Kenny is dead.
c02150 +++$+++ Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
c02150 +++$+++ Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
c02150 +++$+++ Find me something, I don't care where it is.
c02150 +++$+++ Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
c02150 +++$+++ Fuck that shit.
c02150 +++$+++ Well, it is kind of a long shot...
c02150 +++$+++ It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
c02150 +++$+++ Well, there's the possibility of...
c02150 +++$+++ Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
c02150 +++$+++ So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
c00983 +++$+++ Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group!
c00983 +++$+++ I had the group liquidated, you little shit. They were insolent.
c00983 +++$+++ Scott, don't say that...
c24621 +++$+++ No.
c24621 +++$+++ Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
c24621 +++$+++ Yes.
c24621 +++$+++ As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
c26715 +++$+++ Stop it. I'm sorry.
c26715 +++$+++ You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
c26715 +++$+++ I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the tent. I don't think I forgot anything else.
c26715 +++$+++ I bet you didn't forget the bachelor party checks.
c26715 +++$+++ Are we going to do this again?
c26715 +++$+++ I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
c26715 +++$+++ I wouldn't know.
c26715 +++$+++ It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
c26715 +++$+++ They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
c26715 +++$+++ Well it's bad timing.
c26715 +++$+++ How do you figure?
c26715 +++$+++ Right before the wedding?
c26715 +++$+++ It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
c26715 +++$+++ I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
c26715 +++$+++ He is.
c26715 +++$+++ He's a moron.
c26715 +++$+++ David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
c08361 +++$+++ SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR COMPASSION
c08361 +++$+++ SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE FASHION
c08361 +++$+++ SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR THE MONEY
c03606 +++$+++ Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
c03606 +++$+++ Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
c03606 +++$+++ Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don't argue with Bobo.
c03606 +++$+++ I know.
c03606 +++$+++ Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
c01710 +++$+++ What's wrong with him?
c01710 +++$+++ What do you think?
c01710 +++$+++ Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
c01710 +++$+++ He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
c01710 +++$+++ Don't even say it, man.
c25144 +++$+++ What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
c25144 +++$+++ Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
c25144 +++$+++ Who? How would I know him?
c25144 +++$+++ He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
c25144 +++$+++ You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
c25144 +++$+++ Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look...
c20791 +++$+++ That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
c20791 +++$+++ What d'you expect?
c20791 +++$+++ You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
c20791 +++$+++ How d'you mean?
c20791 +++$+++ Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
c20791 +++$+++ No.
c20791 +++$+++ So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
c20791 +++$+++ You don't think much of yourself, do you?
c20791 +++$+++ Well, that's a funny thing to say.
c20791 +++$+++ You keep asking me why I'm here.
c20791 +++$+++ Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
c20791 +++$+++ I like a place with lots of life.
c20791 +++$+++ How about another beer?
c20791 +++$+++ Go on - you can have one!
c00001 +++$+++ Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
c00001 +++$+++ Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
c00001 +++$+++ Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
c22030 +++$+++ Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh?
c22030 +++$+++ Oh, I don't know, I... I...
c22030 +++$+++ I... I'll get the grits.
c20494 +++$+++ Is it over ?
c20494 +++$+++ Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
c20494 +++$+++ In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.
c08563 +++$+++ Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
c08563 +++$+++ I do okay.  How about you?
c08563 +++$+++ I noticed.
c24210 +++$+++ Then this is it.
c24210 +++$+++ What?
c24210 +++$+++ War?
c17467 +++$+++ ...About five years now.
c17467 +++$+++ Get the fuck outta here.
c17467 +++$+++ You're a government spook?
c05491 +++$+++ Sit down.
c05491 +++$+++ Is everything okay?
c05491 +++$+++ You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
c05491 +++$+++ About the alibi --
c24654 +++$+++ Is that a fact?  He's a dilly, ain't he?  By the by, what did he have against this boy?
c24654 +++$+++ He goes out with girls.
c24654 +++$+++ Go out with DIFFERENT girls!
c15052 +++$+++ You okay?
c15052 +++$+++ Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
c15052 +++$+++ Hospital food.
c11934 +++$+++ ...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
c11934 +++$+++ What?! He's a son of a bitch!
c11934 +++$+++ Really?...
c03949 +++$+++ You're Julia, right?
c03949 +++$+++ That's right. Who are you?
c03949 +++$+++ I'm brother Frank.
c03949 +++$+++ I came for the wedding.
c08750 +++$+++ You don't want me.
c08750 +++$+++ Rheya.
c08750 +++$+++ For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
c13080 +++$+++ My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
c13080 +++$+++ Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
c13080 +++$+++ Er, don't you want to search me?
c13080 +++$+++ No, sir.
c13080 +++$+++ My I.D. cards.
c13080 +++$+++ No need, sir
c13080 +++$+++ No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
c26562 +++$+++ That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
c26562 +++$+++ ...things change.
c26562 +++$+++ ...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
c26562 +++$+++ I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
c26562 +++$+++ I'm sure you would.
c03623 +++$+++ You want a drink?
c03623 +++$+++ I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
c03623 +++$+++ No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
c03623 +++$+++ I'll get it.
c20759 +++$+++ I can't go. I'm too fucked up.
c20759 +++$+++ I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
c20759 +++$+++ I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
c20759 +++$+++ No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
c20759 +++$+++ If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
c20759 +++$+++ No fuckin' way!
c20759 +++$+++ I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
c13064 +++$+++ What a relief! I don't know what I'd do if you ever got promoted.
c13064 +++$+++ Don't worry.
c13064 +++$+++ But if they did promote you
c13064 +++$+++ I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
c13064 +++$+++ Would you really, Sam?
c13064 +++$+++ You've been promoted.
c24586 +++$+++ A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him.  He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
c24586 +++$+++ Were his parents...attentive to him?
c24586 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c24586 +++$+++ You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
c24586 +++$+++ That's right.
c24586 +++$+++ Did his parents attend to that?
c24586 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c24586 +++$+++ The Walkers loved Sean.  He was their only child...the object of all their attention.  I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his nature.  But Risa, she's still got dreams.
c13085 +++$+++ Well, yes ... and no. Officially, only Central Service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... Could you hold these.
c13085 +++$+++ ... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can't get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I'm careful.  ... Mind you, if ever they could prove I'd been working on their equipment ... well, that's a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
c13085 +++$+++ Sorry. wouldn't it be easier just to work for Central Services?
c13085 +++$+++ Couldn't stand the pa - ah - we're getting warm -
c13085 +++$+++ The pace?
c13085 +++$+++ The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
c13085 +++$+++ Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
c13085 +++$+++ Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
c13085 +++$+++ No. But I can bypass it with one of these
c26734 +++$+++ Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
c26734 +++$+++ The wahoo?
c26734 +++$+++ The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
c26734 +++$+++ The wahoo moment?
c26734 +++$+++ That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
c26734 +++$+++ I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
c05856 +++$+++ Certainly not.
c05856 +++$+++ Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
c05856 +++$+++ Uh-huh.  Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
c08510 +++$+++ I took out thirteen dollars.
c08510 +++$+++ This is a lot of money.
c08510 +++$+++ I told you this was a sweet set-up.
c08510 +++$+++ Maybe you could run it without Stella.
c05136 +++$+++ Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
c05136 +++$+++ But you copy my work every week.
c05136 +++$+++ Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
c05136 +++$+++ I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
c05136 +++$+++ Or something.
c24374 +++$+++ I want to talk to you for a minute.
c24374 +++$+++ Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
c24374 +++$+++ They've come for my car.
c24374 +++$+++ Please.  Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
c24374 +++$+++ Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
c05895 +++$+++ Was this your idea?
c05895 +++$+++ Yes. Hold this pigeon.
c05895 +++$+++ You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
c05895 +++$+++ That was easy. I read your books.
c05895 +++$+++ Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
c05895 +++$+++ I saw a man whose life was empty.
c05895 +++$+++ Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
c23559 +++$+++ I tell you - this is the only way to travel.
c23559 +++$+++ You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
c23559 +++$+++ No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
c23559 +++$+++ I may spill something.
c23559 +++$+++ So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
c23559 +++$+++ What's the surprise?
c23559 +++$+++ Uh-uh.  Not yet.
c23559 +++$+++ When?
c23559 +++$+++ We better have a drink first.
c23559 +++$+++ No fair guessing.
c14672 +++$+++ Hello.
c14672 +++$+++ Ronald?
c14672 +++$+++ It's Kathryn.
c23010 +++$+++ Another little problem.
c23010 +++$+++ What do we do now?
c23010 +++$+++ The show must ... you know
c23010 +++$+++ Go on.
c23010 +++$+++ Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
c23010 +++$+++ I don't know. It's a mystery.
c00961 +++$+++ I haven't had fun like that since college.
c00961 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c00961 +++$+++ I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die.
c08138 +++$+++ A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
c08138 +++$+++ That's right, Steve.
c08138 +++$+++ Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
c15472 +++$+++ You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
c15472 +++$+++ Yeah, uh, just a minute
c15472 +++$+++ Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
c15472 +++$+++ Do it!
c14280 +++$+++ You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
c14280 +++$+++ Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
c14280 +++$+++ Shoot.
c14280 +++$+++ It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
c14280 +++$+++ I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
c14280 +++$+++ It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
c14280 +++$+++ How is it possible?
c00106 +++$+++ Yeah.  He wanted a girl from Czechoslovakia, but I sent him Honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - Honey was killed...?  Poor girl...
c00106 +++$+++ Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
c00106 +++$+++ Did you tell him you did?
c07127 +++$+++ Oh, Happy!  Dick Nixon ... You remember him.
c07127 +++$+++ Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously making him happy.
c07127 +++$+++ Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
c07127 +++$+++ Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
c07127 +++$+++ Won or lost?
c07127 +++$+++ Someday, Dick.
c06945 +++$+++ And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
c06945 +++$+++ They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
c06945 +++$+++ What happens if they don't do that?
c06945 +++$+++ Great.
c13361 +++$+++ Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
c13361 +++$+++ No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
c13361 +++$+++ Fine, fine. How's your family?
c13361 +++$+++ Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
c13361 +++$+++ Oh, good.
c13361 +++$+++ Congratulations.
c26011 +++$+++ Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
c26011 +++$+++ It could mean that, yes.
c26011 +++$+++ That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
c26011 +++$+++ Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
c10006 +++$+++ Call him?
c10006 +++$+++ Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
c10006 +++$+++ I don't know.  I won't be.
c09611 +++$+++ What was that?
c09611 +++$+++ Nothing.
c09611 +++$+++ I'm  fine.  Really.
c02252 +++$+++ Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
c02252 +++$+++ Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
c02252 +++$+++ Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
c09063 +++$+++ Will that stop the tear?
c09063 +++$+++ You got me, Commander.
c09063 +++$+++ Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
c25366 +++$+++ Your health and happiness has always been my first concern, Charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and I think I know you better than your own mother...
c25366 +++$+++ You think?
c25366 +++$+++ Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
c25366 +++$+++ W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
c25366 +++$+++ Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
c25366 +++$+++ You're a fine judge of character, Charles.  It'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake.  But if she's not -- then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head.
c05351 +++$+++ What?
c05351 +++$+++ Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
c05351 +++$+++ I'm not playing a game now.
c05351 +++$+++ Yes you are.  You're playing word games.
c05351 +++$+++ What is this?
c05351 +++$+++ What?  By attacking me?
c10887 +++$+++ All I want is one more week.
c10887 +++$+++ Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
c10887 +++$+++ Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
c10887 +++$+++ You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
c10887 +++$+++ I'll have a decision by next week.
c10887 +++$+++ It's gone on long enough. You're out.
c10887 +++$+++ Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
c10887 +++$+++ You have proof?
c10887 +++$+++ I'll have it.
c10887 +++$+++ Next week.
c20515 +++$+++ Jesus Christ ! I'm just a temp for Christ sakes !
c20515 +++$+++ Shut up ! It's me.
c20515 +++$+++ I think I'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination.
c20515 +++$+++ Nothing.
c26301 +++$+++ John?  John where are you going?
c26301 +++$+++ I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
c26301 +++$+++ John, please--
c26301 +++$+++ I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
c26301 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c26301 +++$+++ Is it so bad?  It would be quick. He wouldn't even have to feel it.
c20456 +++$+++ A car ... a car accident.
c20456 +++$+++ Are you okay?
c20456 +++$+++ Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
c09893 +++$+++ You're late.
c09893 +++$+++ Got here as soon as I could.
c09893 +++$+++ Dance with me...
c09893 +++$+++ Trust me...
c18562 +++$+++ Oww!
c18562 +++$+++ Careful.  What's wrong?
c18562 +++$+++ Nothing.
c18562 +++$+++ Nothing, huh?
c18562 +++$+++ That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
c18562 +++$+++ Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
c18562 +++$+++ Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.
c18562 +++$+++ Oh.  Want to talk about it?
c18562 +++$+++ Terrific.
c07263 +++$+++ That's right.
c07263 +++$+++ Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
c07263 +++$+++ That is so right.
c07263 +++$+++ Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
c07263 +++$+++ So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
c07445 +++$+++ Father, tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness?
c07445 +++$+++ You know what happened.
c07445 +++$+++ No, I don't.
c07445 +++$+++ Everyone knows.  It's what made me a hero.  Me, Harry Lee, all of us.  I got a medal.  Men bought me drinks. They still do sometimes.  Everyone knows what happened.
c07445 +++$+++ Tell me what everyone doesn't know.
c07445 +++$+++ And what do they know?
c07445 +++$+++ That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you retook it, you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation.
c07445 +++$+++ That's right.
c07445 +++$+++ Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
c07572 +++$+++ Fine newspaper the Tribune.
c07572 +++$+++ Well, I should say!
c07572 +++$+++ I knew your managing editor very well.
c07572 +++$+++ Is that so?
c07572 +++$+++ Yale '21, I believe.
c07572 +++$+++ We were classmates.
c08293 +++$+++ Can't.
c08293 +++$+++ You said you weren't always impotent.
c08293 +++$+++ That's correct.
c08293 +++$+++ So you have had sex.
c08293 +++$+++ Yes.
c08293 +++$+++ Who was the last person you had sex with?
c08293 +++$+++ Her name was Elizabeth.
c08293 +++$+++ So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
c08293 +++$+++ No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
c08293 +++$+++ What was the problem?
c08293 +++$+++ The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
c08293 +++$+++ So you lied to her?
c08293 +++$+++ Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
c08293 +++$+++ How come?
c08293 +++$+++ I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
c08293 +++$+++ And now you can?
c08293 +++$+++ Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
c08293 +++$+++ Don't you get lonely?
c08293 +++$+++ How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
c08293 +++$+++ I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
c08293 +++$+++ Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
c08293 +++$+++ Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
c08293 +++$+++ If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
c08293 +++$+++ I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
c08293 +++$+++ Subtlety?
c08293 +++$+++ Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
c08293 +++$+++ And you feel the same way with John?
c08293 +++$+++ Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
c08293 +++$+++ Interesting analogy.
c08293 +++$+++ I'm babbling.
c08293 +++$+++ No, you're not.
c08293 +++$+++ God, I m so mad at him!!
c08293 +++$+++ Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
c12618 +++$+++ Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon.  I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
c12618 +++$+++ Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
c12618 +++$+++ Oh my God. Is her son OK?
c25965 +++$+++ I already lost everything once.
c25965 +++$+++ So did I.
c25965 +++$+++ But then I had a brother and a sister left.
c25965 +++$+++ So had I.
c25965 +++$+++ Nothing is left but us.
c05548 +++$+++ Twould appear other travelers precede us.
c05548 +++$+++ Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
c05548 +++$+++ Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps.  Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
c07826 +++$+++ Manolete?!
c07826 +++$+++ Who the hell's Manolete?
c07826 +++$+++ The great Spanish bullfighter
c07826 +++$+++ No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and Booth.  Imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian plains--
c02455 +++$+++ What?
c02455 +++$+++ What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
c02455 +++$+++ What have you got there?
c07738 +++$+++ That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
c07738 +++$+++ You're goin' on a trip?
c07738 +++$+++ No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
c07738 +++$+++ You should go on a trip.
c07738 +++$+++ No thanks.
c07738 +++$+++ Let's just leave it there for now.
c15515 +++$+++ It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
c15515 +++$+++ When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
c15515 +++$+++ Yeah.  But not for long.
c23493 +++$+++ Celebrate? What for?
c23493 +++$+++ It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
c23493 +++$+++ Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
c23493 +++$+++ I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
c25400 +++$+++ I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
c25400 +++$+++ Why did she have to die?
c25400 +++$+++ Only God knows the answer to that.
c25400 +++$+++ I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
c25400 +++$+++ I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
c25400 +++$+++ Jeanne... calm down...!  Calm down, Jeanne!
c11131 +++$+++ You heard?  They put us both on the break-in thing. Simons liked the way we worked together.  Listen, I'm sorry I said your story was bullshit.
c11131 +++$+++ It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
c11131 +++$+++ I was sure trying.
c10040 +++$+++ It must be great with a wife like that.
c10040 +++$+++ Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
c10040 +++$+++ Nah.
c10040 +++$+++ Well once. Mary.
c01517 +++$+++ Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
c01517 +++$+++ How long would you need me?
c01517 +++$+++ Two weeks.
c01517 +++$+++ What's the pay?
c01517 +++$+++ I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
c05335 +++$+++ Peter...
c05335 +++$+++ I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
c05335 +++$+++ I want to be the best I can.
c09822 +++$+++ Where is she?!
c09822 +++$+++ Hey, take it easy.
c09822 +++$+++ If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
c02405 +++$+++ This... is my new home?
c02405 +++$+++ Yes.
c02405 +++$+++ Of course! What did you think?
c22889 +++$+++ Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls.
c22889 +++$+++ Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
c22889 +++$+++ And my Dad? Any word on him?
c12110 +++$+++ Impressive
c12110 +++$+++ Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing.  So I'm here to set you free.
c12110 +++$+++ Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
c10247 +++$+++ So, been married long?
c10247 +++$+++ Eight years.
c10247 +++$+++ Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
c18491 +++$+++ I told you -- I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
c18491 +++$+++ Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
c18491 +++$+++ I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
c18491 +++$+++ Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
c23577 +++$+++ Don't I know you two from somewhere?
c23577 +++$+++ We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
c23577 +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Where do you think you're going?
c23577 +++$+++ You ain't going nowhere.
c09996 +++$+++ Whose place is this again?
c09996 +++$+++ It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
c09996 +++$+++ I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
c09996 +++$+++ How come he let you go?
c09996 +++$+++ 'Cause I didn't ask him.
c09996 +++$+++ Well, he has never let me go.  He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun.  All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.
c20886 +++$+++ Guess who I did it with last night...
c20886 +++$+++ Roger in Op/Ed.
c20886 +++$+++ Who told!
c20886 +++$+++ Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
c05355 +++$+++ In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
c05355 +++$+++ For emphasis?
c05355 +++$+++ Exactly.  It's the key.
c05355 +++$+++ But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
c05355 +++$+++ A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
c05355 +++$+++ Where's the note?
c04632 +++$+++ "I'm Lowell Bergman, I'm from '60 Minutes.'" You know, you take the "60 Minutes" out of that sentence, nobody returns your phone call. Maybe Wigand's right. Maybe I'm hooked. What am I hooked on? The rush? "60 Minutes"? What the hell for? Infotainment. It's so fucking useless, all of it.
c04632 +++$+++ So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
c04632 +++$+++ Free press? Press is free... for anyone who owns one. Larry Tisch has a free press.
c04632 +++$+++ Get some perspective, Lowell.
c04632 +++$+++ I got perspective.
c04632 +++$+++ No, you do not.
c04632 +++$+++ You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
c01740 +++$+++ I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
c01740 +++$+++ Me?
c01740 +++$+++ No, that door over there.
c01740 +++$+++ I don't want to die.
c01740 +++$+++ Are you afraid?
c01740 +++$+++ Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
c01740 +++$+++ Exactly. Woah.
c01740 +++$+++ Death.
c01740 +++$+++ The fear of death, The pain of consciousness.  Did you mix this martini?
c01740 +++$+++ No. Bob did.
c01740 +++$+++ Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
c01740 +++$+++ Anthony, I'm petrified.
c17145 +++$+++ Senator Kane.
c17145 +++$+++ This meeting is adjourned.
c17145 +++$+++ The committee is adjourned until further notice.
c25819 +++$+++ That's the truth--every single word!
c25819 +++$+++ I sincerely hope so--
c25819 +++$+++ For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
c24264 +++$+++ Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
c24264 +++$+++ No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
c24264 +++$+++ What? What'd you do?
c24264 +++$+++ That chick, Erica?
c24264 +++$+++ Well, w-what happened?
c24264 +++$+++ Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
c24264 +++$+++ What'd you do?
c24264 +++$+++ I hit her.
c24264 +++$+++ You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
c24264 +++$+++ Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
c24264 +++$+++ Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
c24264 +++$+++ Oh fuck.
c14395 +++$+++ Then you get your ass outta here, I don't wanta see you again...
c14395 +++$+++ I brought a present for the lady, there.  I'm looking for her, to give her the present...
c14395 +++$+++ You break into her apartment to deliver a gift?  Where is it?
c14395 +++$+++ The door was open, swear to God, I'm just looking for her when you come charging up the stairs...
c14395 +++$+++ I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
c06290 +++$+++ Captain Camembert! Captain Camembert!
c06290 +++$+++ Excuse me, Sergeant.
c06290 +++$+++ Yes, Reverend?
c06290 +++$+++ They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
c08393 +++$+++ Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
c08393 +++$+++ Oh, yeah. Yeah.
c08393 +++$+++ And?
c08393 +++$+++ I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
c08393 +++$+++ How about the new ending? Did you like that?
c08393 +++$+++ Oh yeah. Much better.
c08393 +++$+++ Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
c20734 +++$+++ The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks.
c20734 +++$+++ Why?
c20734 +++$+++ Why?
c20734 +++$+++ What? Oh. A film.
c18172 +++$+++ I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
c18172 +++$+++ Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
c18172 +++$+++ I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
c18172 +++$+++ Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
c18172 +++$+++ Then who are they?
c18172 +++$+++ You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
c18172 +++$+++ What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
c18172 +++$+++ Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
c18172 +++$+++ It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
c18172 +++$+++ All accidents until proven otherwise.
c10382 +++$+++ Hi, honey, how's Donna?
c10382 +++$+++ Fine.
c10382 +++$+++ School?
c10382 +++$+++ ...school's fine...
c10382 +++$+++ Not really.
c03490 +++$+++ But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
c03490 +++$+++ Kind of.
c03490 +++$+++ Well how did it happen?
c03490 +++$+++ How do you think.
c03490 +++$+++ I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
c03490 +++$+++ Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
c03490 +++$+++ I'm curious.
c03490 +++$+++ We'd go to his car.
c03490 +++$+++ I don't think we were the first.
c23325 +++$+++ Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
c23325 +++$+++ I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
c23325 +++$+++ Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
c04803 +++$+++ I hope you got your money.
c04803 +++$+++ You bet I did.
c04803 +++$+++ Congratulations.
c04803 +++$+++ Same to you.
c04803 +++$+++ I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
c01526 +++$+++ Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
c01526 +++$+++ He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
c01526 +++$+++ What?!
c02751 +++$+++ Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
c02751 +++$+++ The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
c02751 +++$+++ I'm taking care of that, Harry. Just hold her.  Reserpine. I guarantee you this'll clear her head. She'll wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
c13644 +++$+++ Promise?
c13644 +++$+++ I promise.
c13644 +++$+++ Where am I to go, Jimmy?
c13644 +++$+++ The Metro.
c13644 +++$+++ Yes. Say hello to Col --
c23527 +++$+++ So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
c23527 +++$+++ I wouldn't say encouraged.
c23527 +++$+++ Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
c23527 +++$+++ So the defendant was encouraged to hope.  Or could have been.
c20526 +++$+++ Visualize a spare?
c20526 +++$+++ Well you know what I mean.
c20526 +++$+++ So, what's on your mind?
c20526 +++$+++ Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
c20526 +++$+++ No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
c26650 +++$+++ It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
c26650 +++$+++ It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
c26650 +++$+++ Madeleine!!
c25208 +++$+++ I'm going back home.
c25208 +++$+++ Why?
c25208 +++$+++ Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
c25208 +++$+++ I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
c25208 +++$+++ But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
c04463 +++$+++ Why did you people come here?
c04463 +++$+++ Air... water... your "sun."
c04463 +++$+++ Where do your people come from?  Where is your home?
c04463 +++$+++ Here... now.
c04463 +++$+++ And before here?
c04463 +++$+++ Many worlds...
c04463 +++$+++ Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
c04463 +++$+++ Peace? No peace.
c04463 +++$+++ Die.
c21377 +++$+++ We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
c21377 +++$+++ What would that be, sir?
c21377 +++$+++ Of course.
c18973 +++$+++ Greatest.
c18973 +++$+++ Greatest...
c18973 +++$+++ Show...
c21460 +++$+++ Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
c21460 +++$+++ We won.
c21460 +++$+++ It satisfied me.
c17826 +++$+++ I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
c17826 +++$+++ Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
c17826 +++$+++ You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
c17826 +++$+++ Did you wait until you were 18?
c26118 +++$+++ Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
c26118 +++$+++ Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
c26118 +++$+++ You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
c20904 +++$+++ Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
c20904 +++$+++ This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was!  I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
c20904 +++$+++ You're twenty-three years old!
c20904 +++$+++ Hear one.  Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
c05026 +++$+++ Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
c05026 +++$+++ Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
c05026 +++$+++ From a slipped disc? That'd be a first.
c05026 +++$+++ I was in Hell. I've been there. It's horrible. I don't want to die, Louis.
c05026 +++$+++ Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
c05026 +++$+++ You ever read Meister Eckart?  How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart?  Good. Okay, let's turn over gently. Right side.
c24775 +++$+++ What are you doing... ?
c24775 +++$+++ Get out.
c24775 +++$+++ I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
c24775 +++$+++ You don't have a choice.  No one else is going to tell you what's going on.
c21441 +++$+++ I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.
c21441 +++$+++ Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
c21441 +++$+++ Get down to Word Processing. Help Jamey look.
c22699 +++$+++ Look at those eyes.
c22699 +++$+++ Lloyd, give it up.
c22699 +++$+++ Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
c22699 +++$+++ Lloyd.
c22699 +++$+++ C'mon, just do it.
c22699 +++$+++ C'mon Lloyd.
c22699 +++$+++ Please?
c22699 +++$+++ Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
c05120 +++$+++ ...Nothing.
c05120 +++$+++ What do we do?
c05120 +++$+++ If you're looking for a shark, you don't look on land. You go out and chum for him.
c05120 +++$+++ Only one sure way to find him -- offer him a little something to eat. Chum -- blood, waste meat, fish, anything. They can sense it miles away. If he's out there, we might be able to get a closer look at him.  It's a good time, too. They're night feeders...
c18163 +++$+++ Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
c18163 +++$+++ You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
c18163 +++$+++ Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
c18163 +++$+++ And what's Steven's status?
c18163 +++$+++ Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
c18163 +++$+++ -- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
c18163 +++$+++ "But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
c18163 +++$+++ -- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
c18163 +++$+++ -- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
c18163 +++$+++ So what stopped her?
c18163 +++$+++ It's complicated. But don't worry --
c18163 +++$+++ -- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
c18163 +++$+++ Not yet.
c18163 +++$+++ So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
c18163 +++$+++ -- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
c18163 +++$+++ -- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
c18163 +++$+++ -- the whole thing is falling apart!
c24444 +++$+++ There is a way.
c24444 +++$+++ I knew it!
c24444 +++$+++ But it's impossible.
c24444 +++$+++ No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
c11082 +++$+++ I'm going to take you to Margo...
c11082 +++$+++ Oh, no...
c11082 +++$+++ No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
c25779 +++$+++ Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
c25779 +++$+++ Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
c25779 +++$+++ I'll take one.
c02669 +++$+++ You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
c02669 +++$+++ What?
c02669 +++$+++ You're right. I didn't tell you that.
c08286 +++$+++ Do you think that's such a good idea?
c08286 +++$+++ Don't you want to make one?
c08286 +++$+++ Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
c08286 +++$+++ What difference does it make why I do it?
c08286 +++$+++ I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
c08286 +++$+++ What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
c08286 +++$+++ That's a good question.
c08286 +++$+++ What do you have to do to get ready?
c08286 +++$+++ Then do it.
c23379 +++$+++ Yeah, they's good all right.
c23379 +++$+++ You got any money?
c23379 +++$+++ They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
c23379 +++$+++ Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
c23379 +++$+++ I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
c08866 +++$+++ Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!
c08866 +++$+++ Let me alone.
c08866 +++$+++ You're crying, Animal.
c08866 +++$+++ It's that song, Harry!
c08866 +++$+++ There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
c17228 +++$+++ That's funny, Mr. Whale.
c17228 +++$+++ It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
c17228 +++$+++ You're serious.
c17228 +++$+++ Quite.
c17228 +++$+++ Then the rumors are true?
c17228 +++$+++ What rumors might those be?
c17228 +++$+++ A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
c18147 +++$+++ Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
c18147 +++$+++ They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
c18147 +++$+++ Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
c18147 +++$+++ They know you are Tutsi!
c26526 +++$+++ Edie...
c26526 +++$+++ He used all of you to get him on that boat. He couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. The one man that could identify him.
c26526 +++$+++ This is all bullshit.
c26526 +++$+++ He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
c26526 +++$+++ He programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. Customs has been
c17207 +++$+++ I never made it to Korea.
c17207 +++$+++ But you said --
c17207 +++$+++ I see.
c08088 +++$+++ Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
c08088 +++$+++ ...What bar?
c08088 +++$+++ The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
c08088 +++$+++ You ever seen this motherfucker before?
c08088 +++$+++ Who, Mr. White?
c08088 +++$+++ Yeah.
c08088 +++$+++ No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
c08088 +++$+++ How can you tell?
c08088 +++$+++ The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
c08088 +++$+++ Did the two of you talk?
c08088 +++$+++ Me and Mr. White?
c08088 +++$+++ Yeah.
c08088 +++$+++ A little.
c08088 +++$+++ What about?
c08088 +++$+++ The Brewers.
c08088 +++$+++ The Milwaukee Brewers?
c08088 +++$+++ Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
c07705 +++$+++ Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
c07705 +++$+++ No.
c07705 +++$+++ They don't get opened until eight.
c10886 +++$+++ Larry...
c10886 +++$+++ What's the matter with you, you've seen the reports. It's a cut and dried case.
c10886 +++$+++ You're too involved Marty.  Jesus look at you. Why don't you turn this case over to someone else?
c20481 +++$+++ Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
c20481 +++$+++ Why should I ?
c20481 +++$+++ You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
c20481 +++$+++ You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
c20481 +++$+++ Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
c20481 +++$+++ I'm not fucking him..
c21708 +++$+++ Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
c21708 +++$+++ Who's our back-up on this?
c21708 +++$+++ This gets better by the minute.
c19955 +++$+++ The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
c19955 +++$+++ And we're very grateful.
c19955 +++$+++ Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
c19955 +++$+++ Undisclosed conflict of interest --
c19955 +++$+++ An indictable offense.
c05500 +++$+++ And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
c05500 +++$+++ I'm so happy for you!
c05500 +++$+++ How'd it go at the trial?
c05500 +++$+++ Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.
c17674 +++$+++ Oh, my goodness!
c17674 +++$+++ Oh, Elliot!
c17674 +++$+++ Hi.
c17674 +++$+++ What are you doing here?
c17674 +++$+++ Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
c17674 +++$+++ Oh, what, in this section of town?
c17674 +++$+++ Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
c17674 +++$+++ You're out looking here?
c17674 +++$+++ Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
c17674 +++$+++ Ohhhh!
c17674 +++$+++ How about you?
c17674 +++$+++ Oh.  Well, I live--
c17674 +++$+++ Oh, yes!  You live near here, don't you?
c17674 +++$+++ Yes, I do.
c17674 +++$+++ Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
c07421 +++$+++ You meet those friends of yours in jail too?
c07421 +++$+++ Yes... No... Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
c07421 +++$+++ I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
c07421 +++$+++ Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
c07421 +++$+++ I don't know. I really don't.
c06954 +++$+++ What?
c06954 +++$+++ You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
c06954 +++$+++ Mother, for petesakes.
c06954 +++$+++ Warm milk. Gross.
c25759 +++$+++ Where'd you get it?
c25759 +++$+++ Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
c25759 +++$+++ What did you want a gun for?
c25759 +++$+++ Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
c25759 +++$+++ Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
c25759 +++$+++ Get moving--
c12078 +++$+++ Ingenious costume.  Let me guess ... Trust-fund goody-goody?
c12078 +++$+++ Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
c12078 +++$+++ I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
c12078 +++$+++ Yawn.
c04719 +++$+++ So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
c04719 +++$+++ At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
c04719 +++$+++ My client has ruled that out.
c04719 +++$+++ My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
c04719 +++$+++ That's delusional.
c04719 +++$+++ My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
c04719 +++$+++ My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
c04719 +++$+++ My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
c04719 +++$+++ Heh heh.
c23398 +++$+++ Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
c23398 +++$+++ How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
c23398 +++$+++ Pick up the fuckin' phone and call 'em, I guess.
c23398 +++$+++ What numbers do you punch?
c23398 +++$+++ I aim to kill you with it.
c17047 +++$+++ Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
c17047 +++$+++ I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
c17047 +++$+++ You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!
c07993 +++$+++ What a zoo!
c07993 +++$+++ What?
c07993 +++$+++ A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
c07993 +++$+++ Pretty mixed up?
c07993 +++$+++ If he could--
c07993 +++$+++ "If he could" what?  You mean your father?
c07993 +++$+++ I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
c07993 +++$+++ I bet you see right through me, don't you?
c15998 +++$+++ What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
c15998 +++$+++ Get your hand off me.
c15998 +++$+++ Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
c15998 +++$+++ Go fuck yourself.
c15998 +++$+++ I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
c12077 +++$+++ Not compared to that "Cobblepot" person you're promoting...
c12077 +++$+++ Scared of Oswald, are you?  Why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
c12077 +++$+++ Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
c22315 +++$+++ It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
c22315 +++$+++ Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
c22315 +++$+++ That's right!
c22315 +++$+++ They killed themselves.  Besides, they were breaking the law.  What they were doing was wrong!  Whatsamatter Booth, don't you believe in miracles?
c18832 +++$+++ That's right.  Will break through.
c18832 +++$+++ I get ah - -
c18832 +++$+++ I know, it's very exciting.
c18832 +++$+++ And scary.
c18832 +++$+++ And scary.
c18832 +++$+++ When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
c18832 +++$+++ Anti-nature.
c11366 +++$+++ The one with the V.P.L.
c11366 +++$+++ V.P.L.?
c11366 +++$+++ Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
c11366 +++$+++ Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
c11366 +++$+++ There are no twos, Max.
c11366 +++$+++ Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
c11366 +++$+++ M'hm.
c11366 +++$+++ How do you like this couple, Max?
c16991 +++$+++ And what you going to do?
c16991 +++$+++ Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
c16991 +++$+++ No, you won't.
c19170 +++$+++ We are not forgettin' Webb's promise!
c19170 +++$+++ British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
c19170 +++$+++ Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
c19170 +++$+++ Does the rule of English law no longer govern?  Has it been replaced by absolutism?
c13248 +++$+++ Did you see a girl come by here?
c13248 +++$+++ You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
c13248 +++$+++ Yes.
c13248 +++$+++ Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
c13248 +++$+++ Wheels?
c13248 +++$+++ My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
c13248 +++$+++ Down there.
c06397 +++$+++ The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
c06397 +++$+++ He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
c06397 +++$+++ I can't do that.
c06397 +++$+++ I want to be put on this case.
c06397 +++$+++ You know I can't assign you to this. You're much too close to it. You were much too close to Sam. The department will take care of it.
c06397 +++$+++ Who's running it?
c06397 +++$+++ Roper...
c06397 +++$+++ Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
c17324 +++$+++ Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
c17324 +++$+++ Week after I'm twenty-one.
c17324 +++$+++ Are they hookin' you up with a job?
c17324 +++$+++ Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
c17324 +++$+++ Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
c17324 +++$+++ Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
c17324 +++$+++ It's a way outta here.
c17324 +++$+++ What do I want a way outta here for? I want to live here the rest of my life. I want to be your next door neighbor. I want to take out kids to little league together up Foley Field.
c17324 +++$+++ Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
c17324 +++$+++ Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
c17324 +++$+++ Listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
c17324 +++$+++ Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
c17324 +++$+++ Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
c17324 +++$+++ Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs. But you know what the best part of my day is? The ten seconds before I knock on the door 'cause I let myself think I might get there, and you'd be gone. I'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there. You just left.
c13191 +++$+++ It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this.  You look so clean and pretty.
c13191 +++$+++ What do you mean clean?
c13191 +++$+++ At work there's always this sort of film over you.
c13191 +++$+++ You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
c22228 +++$+++ You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
c22228 +++$+++ How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
c22228 +++$+++ I rest my case.
c08863 +++$+++ Look at her! Isn't she beautiful! Married an orchestra leader!
c08863 +++$+++ So what? There's other women!
c08863 +++$+++ Not for me! Betty! Betty!
c08863 +++$+++ Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
c08863 +++$+++ You'll fix me up!
c08863 +++$+++ Sure, Animal! I'll get you over there!
c08863 +++$+++ How? Pinky Miller from Barrack 8 tried to get over there and they shot him in the leg!
c08863 +++$+++ It takes a gimmick, Animal, and I figured us a little gimmick.
c08863 +++$+++ Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
c20371 +++$+++ |      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
c20371 +++$+++ Look.  I'm warning you.
c20371 +++$+++ Well, It's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a... look at the bones.
c11740 +++$+++ This is the bank.  This is the hotel.  In the morning I will enter the bank.
c11740 +++$+++ Check.
c11740 +++$+++ He will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  He'll stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
c11740 +++$+++ No.  It would be amateur.  A risk. He'll wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  Once I'm inside, he'll move to the hotel. He'll go up the back, too much traffic in the front.
c15246 +++$+++ Hi.
c15246 +++$+++ Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
c15246 +++$+++ Excuse me.
c15246 +++$+++ In the new library there.
c15246 +++$+++ Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
c15246 +++$+++ Depends how you define 'new'...
c15246 +++$+++ You're the kid who was home schooled.
c15246 +++$+++ Yeah. How'd you know?
c15246 +++$+++ I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
c15246 +++$+++ Four colors? Neato!
c15246 +++$+++ HARRY Dunne.
c21534 +++$+++ You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
c21534 +++$+++ My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
c21534 +++$+++ At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
c00370 +++$+++ Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
c00370 +++$+++ Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
c00370 +++$+++ You'll get your money. Don't talk to any newspapers about this. Twombley's a big deal down in Massachusetts, you know. Tell them your lawyer says you shouldn't comment.
c00370 +++$+++ No, of course not. Just say it, that's all.
c12969 +++$+++ You said he washed the money?
c12969 +++$+++ Yeah.
c12969 +++$+++ Then what?  Exactly.
c12969 +++$+++ He hung it up.
c12969 +++$+++ To let it dry.
c12214 +++$+++ You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
c12214 +++$+++ He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
c12214 +++$+++ OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of three.  I'm gonna give you three seconds...
c02009 +++$+++ He'll need clothes... some money...
c02009 +++$+++ Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
c02009 +++$+++ Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
c02009 +++$+++ Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
c20447 +++$+++ Beautiful night.
c20447 +++$+++ Yeah.
c20447 +++$+++ Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
c20447 +++$+++ No problem. What's on your mind?
c20447 +++$+++ Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
c20447 +++$+++ Whatever.
c20447 +++$+++ A man's attitude ... a man's attitude goes some ways toward how a man's life will be. Is that somethin' you agree with?
c20447 +++$+++ Sure.
c20447 +++$+++ Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
c20447 +++$+++ I agree with what you said...truly.
c20447 +++$+++ What did I say?
c20447 +++$+++ That a man's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be.
c20447 +++$+++ How's that?
c16070 +++$+++ Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack.  So. Susie.  How 'bout it.
c16070 +++$+++ Huh?
c16070 +++$+++ Got another song for us?
c16070 +++$+++ Well then ... shall we?
c15265 +++$+++ What?
c15265 +++$+++ Our own special bus.
c15265 +++$+++ Duh. The cool kids sit in the back of the bus. Here, every row is in the back. We're all cool!
c13798 +++$+++ Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?
c13798 +++$+++ Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
c13798 +++$+++ They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
c13798 +++$+++ Follow me.
c15880 +++$+++ Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
c15880 +++$+++ I thought those seekers were set for stun!
c15880 +++$+++ That they are.
c15880 +++$+++ That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.  Higher you'd jump!  Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.
c19214 +++$+++ So do you know these geezers well?
c19214 +++$+++ Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years.
c19214 +++$+++ Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.
c26685 +++$+++ Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
c26685 +++$+++ What does that mean?
c26685 +++$+++ You got us into this mess.
c26685 +++$+++ Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
c26685 +++$+++ Would you, shush?! These phones aren't secure!
c26685 +++$+++ Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
c26685 +++$+++ Watch the tone fella.
c00242 +++$+++ At least, the cat comes back.
c00242 +++$+++ You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
c00242 +++$+++ Don't exist bud.
c18632 +++$+++ I don't talk that way.
c18632 +++$+++ Remember, skiers stay up longer.
c18632 +++$+++ I am serious.
c22230 +++$+++ Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
c22230 +++$+++ I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
c22230 +++$+++ Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
c22230 +++$+++ I do bite my thumb, sir!
c22230 +++$+++ [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law on our side, if I say ay?
c04587 +++$+++ You're leaving.
c04587 +++$+++ Food doesn't agree with me.
c04587 +++$+++ I'm leaving too.
c04587 +++$+++ Why?
c04587 +++$+++ This business is over.
c04587 +++$+++ I'm sorry. What will you do?
c04587 +++$+++ Go back to Tokyo. Try to get another tour....You're following GRUNER?
c04587 +++$+++ Now, so am I...What's so interesting about him?
c18231 +++$+++ Not quite.  This wasn't here.
c18231 +++$+++ No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
c18231 +++$+++ Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
c18231 +++$+++ Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
c18231 +++$+++ Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
c22117 +++$+++ Yes Brad.
c22117 +++$+++ I've got something to say.
c22117 +++$+++ Uh huh.
c22117 +++$+++ Oh Brad.
c08068 +++$+++ Hot chocolate.
c08068 +++$+++ What?
c08068 +++$+++ Get a hot mug of chocolate.  First thing I'm gonna do.
c08068 +++$+++ And some pecan pie.
c13123 +++$+++ Whatja doing?
c13123 +++$+++ I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
c13123 +++$+++ The brakes are shot.
c13123 +++$+++ I've taken that into consideration.
c13123 +++$+++ I never felt better in my life.
c05430 +++$+++ What steps do we take now?
c05430 +++$+++ We operate.  We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... I just did this procedure on a Senator and he's doing fine.
c05430 +++$+++ It's hard to say.  It's a delicate surgery.  There's no getting around the fact that it's a very high-risk situation.
c26491 +++$+++ There was ninety-one million -
c26491 +++$+++ We know, but our man says no way on the dope. This Hungarian tells me the whole bunch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next' day. They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it.
c26491 +++$+++ What was the money for?
c26491 +++$+++ He didn't know. No one doing the deal knew except a few key people. This guy says they were real hush about it. Whatever it was it was highly sensitive.
c26491 +++$+++ I don't get it.
c26491 +++$+++ They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
c26491 +++$+++ Bear with me here...
c02614 +++$+++ Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
c02614 +++$+++ Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
c02614 +++$+++ Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
c02983 +++$+++ Dr. Niko Topopolosis?
c02983 +++$+++ It's Tatopoulos.
c02983 +++$+++ Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
c02983 +++$+++ Follow me.
c09366 +++$+++ Charles! What's up, man?
c09366 +++$+++ Oh. You know.
c09366 +++$+++ Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
c09366 +++$+++ ...piece of shit. Listen, Charles, this is my friend Rob from Back East.
c14896 +++$+++ The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
c14896 +++$+++ How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
c14896 +++$+++ Curse?
c14896 +++$+++ What is it if it ain't a curse?
c14896 +++$+++ It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
c14896 +++$+++ That sounds like a curse to me.
c14896 +++$+++ We thought we were escaping here. We thought we'd found an uninhabited island. Christ! This place is a worse nightmare than anything I've seen yet!
c14896 +++$+++ I'm sure that's true, miss. And that's why we're doin' what we're doin'. What's happenin' underground here is just what Lucifer planned for this sinful race o' man. But we're gonna beat Lucifer. We're gonna put an end to what's happenin' here.
c14896 +++$+++ Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
c14896 +++$+++ That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
c14896 +++$+++ You think you can find your boat? There's a thousand little inlets and backwaters all through here. You remember all the ways you turned to get where you are now? You leave yourself a trail?
c17662 +++$+++ I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
c17662 +++$+++ Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
c17662 +++$+++ Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
c17662 +++$+++ Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
c17662 +++$+++ What?
c17662 +++$+++ Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
c17662 +++$+++ You're joking.
c17662 +++$+++ No, he called late last night.
c17662 +++$+++ I, uh, I'm very surprised.
c17662 +++$+++ He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
c17662 +++$+++ And you, you-you're going?
c17662 +++$+++ Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
c17662 +++$+++ But I'm seeing him.
c17662 +++$+++ I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
c17662 +++$+++ Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
c22387 +++$+++ Where are you going?
c22387 +++$+++ Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
c22387 +++$+++ Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
c22387 +++$+++ Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards.
c22387 +++$+++ Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit!
c22387 +++$+++ My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
c22387 +++$+++ It's my job!
c22387 +++$+++ You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
c22387 +++$+++ I have plenty of dates.
c22387 +++$+++ Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat?
c22387 +++$+++ And you ain't black!
c21975 +++$+++ Two: what if I didn't miss?
c21975 +++$+++ You did.
c21975 +++$+++ Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
c21975 +++$+++ -- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?   What did your life mean?  Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?
c01951 +++$+++ Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
c01951 +++$+++ And got well paid for it on both occasions.
c01951 +++$+++ The winning side would have paid you much better.
c01951 +++$+++ Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
c01951 +++$+++ Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
c26254 +++$+++ Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
c26254 +++$+++ I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
c26254 +++$+++ He should have been in restraints.  It was bad judgment on your part, plain and simple.  why not just cop to it?
c26254 +++$+++ Okay, it was bad judgment.  But I have the strangest feeling about him -- I've seen him somewhere and...
c26254 +++$+++ Two policemen were already in the hospital and now we have an orderly with a broken arm and a Security Officer with a fractured skull.
c26254 +++$+++ You see what I mean?  You're being defensive.  Isn't she being defensive, Bob?
c08710 +++$+++ No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
c08710 +++$+++ Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
c08710 +++$+++ Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
c22714 +++$+++ Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
c22714 +++$+++ Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
c22714 +++$+++ Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
c17296 +++$+++ You son of a bitch. She's been here.
c17296 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c17296 +++$+++ Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
c17296 +++$+++ Jezuz Christ!
c17296 +++$+++ What am I doing? I'm in here! I'm in jail. I can't stop people from coming to see me.
c10598 +++$+++ What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
c10598 +++$+++ It's just another case, Sailor.
c10598 +++$+++ One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
c15220 +++$+++ Hey!  What did I say?
c15220 +++$+++ Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
c15220 +++$+++ Talk to your son.
c12119 +++$+++ It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
c12119 +++$+++ What did you say?
c12119 +++$+++ He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
c12119 +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous.
c21672 +++$+++ Susan and I are very old friends, James.
c21672 +++$+++ Fuck off.
c21672 +++$+++ And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
c21672 +++$+++ My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
c21672 +++$+++ It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
c21672 +++$+++ I've known Susan for more than fifteen years.  James, we're old allies.
c04708 +++$+++ You wounded me first, Marylin.
c04708 +++$+++ Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
c04708 +++$+++ You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
c04708 +++$+++ Forgery? Fraud?
c04708 +++$+++ Income tax evasion?
c04708 +++$+++ Murder?
c04708 +++$+++ I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
c03168 +++$+++ Take it easy, you'll live longer.
c03168 +++$+++ Did you see him?
c03168 +++$+++ Who?
c03168 +++$+++ The guy. He just came this way.
c03168 +++$+++ What guy?
c03168 +++$+++ There's somebody else on this boat.
c03168 +++$+++ What? What the hell're you talking about.
c03168 +++$+++ I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
c03168 +++$+++ Are you sure?
c03168 +++$+++ Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
c03168 +++$+++ It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
c05962 +++$+++ The victim's name is Leo Crow.
c05962 +++$+++ Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
c05962 +++$+++ Check NCIC, maybe he's got a record.  Then send a protection team as soon as we lock the location.
c22199 +++$+++ We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
c22199 +++$+++ Apollo's a great fighter.
c22199 +++$+++ Maybe --
c00228 +++$+++ Three more hours...
c00228 +++$+++ Where is he?
c00228 +++$+++ Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
c00228 +++$+++ He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
c02532 +++$+++ There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
c02532 +++$+++ Alexander Pope?
c02532 +++$+++ Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
c02532 +++$+++ You are such a sweetheart.
c16063 +++$+++ Fucking.
c16063 +++$+++ For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
c16063 +++$+++ Give me that.
c16063 +++$+++ Hey!
c16063 +++$+++ We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
c16063 +++$+++ We do not take tips.  I'll apply this to the cost of the dress.
c25237 +++$+++ What did they say before the bad card came up?
c25237 +++$+++ You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
c25237 +++$+++ Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
c01240 +++$+++ Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
c01240 +++$+++ I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
c01240 +++$+++ What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
c01240 +++$+++ Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
c05626 +++$+++ No one would blame me if I left!
c05626 +++$+++ I'd blame you.  I want you here.
c05626 +++$+++ I'm not doing it!
c05626 +++$+++ It'll be fine.
c05626 +++$+++ I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
c22962 +++$+++ No Debbie! That ain't what happened! They been lyin' to you...
c22962 +++$+++ You lie! All white men lie...and kill...
c22962 +++$+++ Debbie, think back! I'm Martin... remember? Remember how I used to let you ride my horse? Tell you stories? Don't you remember me, Debbie?
c22962 +++$+++ I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
c22962 +++$+++ These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
c16189 +++$+++ Mrs. Peterson.
c16189 +++$+++ Hello Jack.  You don't have to stop singing on my account...
c16189 +++$+++ You know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
c05452 +++$+++ I missed you Kris.
c05452 +++$+++ I missed you to Mr. Parker.
c05452 +++$+++ You were right.  From the heart is always better.
c21163 +++$+++ Wow... .
c21163 +++$+++ What do you weigh these days, slugger?
c21163 +++$+++ ...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
c21163 +++$+++ Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
c21163 +++$+++ It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night-- we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready-- remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens-- This bum Wilson he gets the title shot-- outdoors in the ballpark! - and what do I get-- a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
c21163 +++$+++ I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
c21163 +++$+++ See! You don't understand!
c21163 +++$+++ You don't understand! I could've been a contender. I could've had class and been somebody. Real class. Instead of a bum, let's face it, which is what I am. It was you, Charley.
c12510 +++$+++ What do you think?
c12510 +++$+++ Sounds like a plan.
c12510 +++$+++ These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
c17897 +++$+++ Millions of people around the world get on busses every day. When was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus?
c17897 +++$+++ Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
c17897 +++$+++ Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
c17897 +++$+++ Second most common?
c17897 +++$+++ Skin cancer.
c17897 +++$+++ Eighty third most common.
c17897 +++$+++ You just made that up.
c25034 +++$+++ Why are you whispering?
c25034 +++$+++ I can't really talk right now.
c25034 +++$+++ What did you find?
c25034 +++$+++ Evidence of a massive infection.
c25034 +++$+++ What kind of infection?
c25034 +++$+++ I don't know.
c25034 +++$+++ Scully -- listen to me. I'm going home, then I'm booking a flight to Dallas. I'm getting you a ticket, too.
c25034 +++$+++ Mulder --
c25034 +++$+++ I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
c25034 +++$+++ I've got a hearing tomorrow --
c25034 +++$+++ Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
c13108 +++$+++ I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
c13108 +++$+++ Maybe I should come up with you.
c13108 +++$+++ If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
c13108 +++$+++ No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
c10652 +++$+++ Came to my senses.
c10652 +++$+++ Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
c10652 +++$+++ Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
c10652 +++$+++ Do you know he won't expel him?
c10652 +++$+++ That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
c05145 +++$+++ Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox?
c05145 +++$+++ Yeah. That was me.
c05145 +++$+++ Why?
c05145 +++$+++ Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
c05145 +++$+++ Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
c05145 +++$+++ You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
c05145 +++$+++ You know it's okay.
c05145 +++$+++ Also, I think I'm in love with you.
c05145 +++$+++ What, you mean as friends?
c05145 +++$+++ No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
c05145 +++$+++ I try really hard, actually...
c05145 +++$+++ No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
c05145 +++$+++ I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
c05145 +++$+++ It does?
c06211 +++$+++ Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
c06211 +++$+++ Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
c06211 +++$+++ My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
c22788 +++$+++ Hi, Gale, any leads?
c22788 +++$+++ Tons and tons.
c22788 +++$+++ Where is Sidney's father?
c22788 +++$+++ Home--where he lives.
c22788 +++$+++ And are the police sure about that?
c22788 +++$+++ Why don't you ask them?
c22788 +++$+++ Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
c22788 +++$+++ No, I don't.
c22788 +++$+++ Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
c03676 +++$+++ Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
c03676 +++$+++ Oh, right.  Sorry.
c03676 +++$+++ Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
c26927 +++$+++ No Mark. MARK Why not?
c26927 +++$+++ I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
c26927 +++$+++ No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
c15716 +++$+++ Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
c15716 +++$+++ The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
c15716 +++$+++ I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
c15716 +++$+++ Is something funny?
c15716 +++$+++ No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
c15716 +++$+++ I don't think so.
c13115 +++$+++ It's coming.  Hold her down.
c13115 +++$+++ What's that, Frank?
c13115 +++$+++ Three legs.
c13115 +++$+++ That's too many.
c13115 +++$+++ It's coming.
c01811 +++$+++ That's crazy.
c01811 +++$+++ No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there...
c01811 +++$+++ Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
c07004 +++$+++ You remember this room?
c07004 +++$+++ I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
c07004 +++$+++ You see? Life can be so simple.
c07004 +++$+++ Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!...  But he got you here.
c12794 +++$+++ Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
c12794 +++$+++ Yes.
c12794 +++$+++ Where did you meet him?
c12794 +++$+++ I'm a nurse.  I used to work at Roseburg Memorial Hospital.  Dr. Paley's on staff there.
c12794 +++$+++ What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
c12794 +++$+++ We dated for about a month last year.
c12794 +++$+++ I realized he wasn't serious.  He was seeing other women -- asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended it.
c20899 +++$+++ That is so--weird that you name your car.
c20899 +++$+++ No it's not. Guys name their penises.
c20899 +++$+++ Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
c20899 +++$+++ Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
c04048 +++$+++ You know, with Ray...
c04048 +++$+++ Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
c04048 +++$+++ No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
c04048 +++$+++ I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?
c01806 +++$+++ Where were you, Jason? In the car.
c01806 +++$+++ Conklin up front.
c01806 +++$+++ I'll get the book.
c01806 +++$+++ No. There's nothing new.
c01806 +++$+++ You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
c01806 +++$+++ Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
c01806 +++$+++ -- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
c25295 +++$+++ Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
c25295 +++$+++ Absolutely, sir. As a matter of fact he called this morning, sir.
c25295 +++$+++ Got it. Puppies.
c04759 +++$+++ Don't want to talk to--don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
c04759 +++$+++ But it's King Westley on the phone.
c04759 +++$+++ Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
c04759 +++$+++ "What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling."  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: "Let 'em topple."
c00639 +++$+++ Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
c00639 +++$+++ I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
c00639 +++$+++ Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
c00639 +++$+++ Ah - you've heard that?
c00639 +++$+++ All Vienna has heard that.
c00639 +++$+++ And do they believe it?
c00639 +++$+++ Is it true?
c00639 +++$+++ Should I?
c00951 +++$+++ She's working on another lead right now.
c00951 +++$+++ Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
c00951 +++$+++ Thank you, Basil.
c00951 +++$+++ Oh, and Austin...
c00951 +++$+++ Yes?
c00951 +++$+++ Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
c00951 +++$+++ Oh, yes. Thank you.
c00951 +++$+++ There's one more thing, Austin.
c00951 +++$+++ Yes?
c00951 +++$+++ Thank you.
c23917 +++$+++ Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for Starside R&D ?
c23917 +++$+++ Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
c23917 +++$+++ I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
c23917 +++$+++ Your father will never let you.
c23917 +++$+++ I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
c23917 +++$+++ Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
c23917 +++$+++ Eight point... no, uh, seven...
c23917 +++$+++ If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
c23917 +++$+++ Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
c17148 +++$+++ How's the baby?
c17148 +++$+++ Sleeping inside me.
c17148 +++$+++ Does it feel like a boy?
c17148 +++$+++ Yes, Michael, it does.
c17148 +++$+++ It made me think of what you told me once.  In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.  That was seven years ago.
c11558 +++$+++ You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
c11558 +++$+++ You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
c11558 +++$+++ What about him?
c11558 +++$+++ Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
c11558 +++$+++ That so.
c11558 +++$+++ All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
c11558 +++$+++ Who is Mickey?
c11558 +++$+++ My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
c11558 +++$+++ Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
c11558 +++$+++ Well, you can't win 'em all.
c12182 +++$+++ Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
c12182 +++$+++ Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
c12182 +++$+++ Yeeees?
c12182 +++$+++ And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
c12182 +++$+++ There aren't hotels?
c12182 +++$+++ Yes, there are hotels.  They just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real American family.  Popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
c12182 +++$+++ I said I'd check with you.
c07754 +++$+++ You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
c07754 +++$+++ Once or twice.
c07754 +++$+++ I hear he's got a whetstone and chisel, and he uses them to sharpen his teeth.
c07754 +++$+++ Then what's he doing here?
c08829 +++$+++ Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
c08829 +++$+++ But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
c08829 +++$+++ Right. We have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. With the waldos.
c09472 +++$+++ Do you renounce Satan.
c09472 +++$+++ I do renounce him.
c09472 +++$+++ I do renounce them.
c10626 +++$+++ You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
c10626 +++$+++ Santos... No... Please, Santos...
c10626 +++$+++ You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
c10626 +++$+++ One day he's gonna find out what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble.
c27351 +++$+++ Do you know what a wire transfer is?
c27351 +++$+++ Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
c27351 +++$+++ My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
c27351 +++$+++ So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
c05260 +++$+++ I swear to God. Sometimes he barks. I can hear him straight off my arm. Ruff, ruff, he goes.
c05260 +++$+++ Yeah?
c05260 +++$+++ Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
c05260 +++$+++ Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.
c19992 +++$+++ I know you said you didn't want any calls...
c19992 +++$+++ That's right I did, didn't I?
c19992 +++$+++ Yeah, but there's a call for you from this guy. He's a cop.
c19992 +++$+++ A cop?
c19992 +++$+++ * I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
c13097 +++$+++ Okay, what happened?
c13097 +++$+++ He's going to be all right, right?
c13097 +++$+++ No. He's dead.
c13097 +++$+++ He's dead and there's nothing we can do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
c26126 +++$+++ Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why weren't you in class today?
c26126 +++$+++ He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
c26126 +++$+++ You seem fine now.
c26126 +++$+++ I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  You never used to lie to me.  But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
c01751 +++$+++ There's a lot of valuable shit in there, Applejack. The silver and the china. The crystal. And the grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet that clock's worth ten grand.
c01751 +++$+++ Why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? It doesn't make any goddamn sense.
c01751 +++$+++ Just settling an old score. You might say revenge.
c01751 +++$+++ That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
c01751 +++$+++ Is that Buckethead?
c04878 +++$+++ Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
c04878 +++$+++ Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
c04878 +++$+++ You sure got it.  You're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A. and you're making one hell of a mistake!
c20914 +++$+++ Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
c20914 +++$+++ Well, are you here with anybody?
c20914 +++$+++ It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
c09090 +++$+++ The Vulcans should be out there right now. We need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we're going to get their attention.
c09090 +++$+++ Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
c09090 +++$+++ <U>Engage.</U>
c08988 +++$+++ Admiral on the bridge!
c08988 +++$+++ As you were, Mr. Saavik.
c08988 +++$+++ Good, I believe you already know my, uh, son --
c02696 +++$+++ O.K., O.K., yes. Hang onto it. We'll be there in thirty minutes.  I finally located a car with adequate horsepower and the proper coloring.  What?! OF COURSE the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?
c02696 +++$+++ Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
c02696 +++$+++ We will. You Samoans are all the same. You have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
c07723 +++$+++ I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
c07723 +++$+++ This is funny.
c07723 +++$+++ This is nice.
c25187 +++$+++ ... Not yet.
c25187 +++$+++ Don't.
c25187 +++$+++ Why?
c25187 +++$+++ Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
c25187 +++$+++ That idiot!
c16593 +++$+++ You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
c16593 +++$+++ I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
c16593 +++$+++ Why don't you try suicide?
c16593 +++$+++ My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
c16593 +++$+++ So why pick me?
c16593 +++$+++ You're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. No one would notice if you disappeared. I've watched you for a couple weeks.
c16593 +++$+++ Maybe I'm just on vacation.
c16593 +++$+++ Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
c16593 +++$+++ I've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
c27030 +++$+++ It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
c27030 +++$+++ Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
c27030 +++$+++ Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
c19156 +++$+++ But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
c19156 +++$+++ "Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
c19156 +++$+++ Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
c11851 +++$+++ We can measure wind.
c11851 +++$+++ Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
c11851 +++$+++ Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
c20156 +++$+++ Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
c20156 +++$+++ Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
c20156 +++$+++ Well, it certainly says you.
c20156 +++$+++ Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.
c03349 +++$+++ Oh, Dana, it's you.
c03349 +++$+++ Hi, Louis.
c03349 +++$+++ Hey, it's crazy in here.  You're missing a classic party.
c03349 +++$+++ Well, actually Louis I have a friend coming by.
c03349 +++$+++ Great!  Bring her, too.  But you better hurry.  I made nachos with non-fat cheese and they're almost gone.  I'll make some more though.
c03349 +++$+++ I got the Twister game for later ...
c16011 +++$+++ Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
c16011 +++$+++ I don't know what you mean.
c16011 +++$+++ The hell you don't.
c16011 +++$+++ I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
c16011 +++$+++ Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
c16011 +++$+++ It wasn't like that.
c16011 +++$+++ No?
c16011 +++$+++ No.
c16011 +++$+++ What was it like?
c16011 +++$+++ That how you see it?
c04308 +++$+++ You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
c04308 +++$+++ Unnhh.
c04308 +++$+++ The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
c04308 +++$+++ Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
c13343 +++$+++ I'd kill ya.
c13343 +++$+++ From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
c13343 +++$+++ Don't try me.
c13343 +++$+++ Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
c13343 +++$+++ C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
c15693 +++$+++ Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
c15693 +++$+++ Are you Hana?
c15693 +++$+++ What do you want?
c15693 +++$+++ Bonjour.
c21346 +++$+++ It's all right.  Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
c21346 +++$+++ It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
c21346 +++$+++ It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
c23110 +++$+++ Working nights?
c23110 +++$+++ I'm a doctor.
c23110 +++$+++ And he's a patient of yours?
c23110 +++$+++ No. But he needs treatment.
c23110 +++$+++ For what?
c23110 +++$+++ A certain weakness.
c23110 +++$+++ The human condition.
c23110 +++$+++ You know about it?
c23110 +++$+++ I write about it?
c23110 +++$+++ No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
c15582 +++$+++ Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
c15582 +++$+++ They're spooks.
c15582 +++$+++ I don't know what that--
c15582 +++$+++ Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
c15582 +++$+++ I don't know <u>anything</u>.
c15582 +++$+++ No shit.
c15582 +++$+++ What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
c15582 +++$+++ Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
c15582 +++$+++ Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
c05503 +++$+++ I'm a bitch.
c05503 +++$+++ Yes, you are.
c05503 +++$+++ Yes, he is.
c02942 +++$+++ North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?
c02942 +++$+++ Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
c02942 +++$+++ Unless you Whiskey Run.
c02942 +++$+++ Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles.  All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub.  But don't waste time opening and closing hatches.  They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.
c04978 +++$+++ Please.
c04978 +++$+++ You live with him.
c04978 +++$+++ I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
c04978 +++$+++ Uh-huh?
c04978 +++$+++ Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
c04978 +++$+++ And your point is?
c04978 +++$+++ Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
c04978 +++$+++ ...and just take it from him.
c03368 +++$+++ Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
c03368 +++$+++ I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
c03368 +++$+++ I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
c03368 +++$+++ You could say that.
c03368 +++$+++ And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
c03368 +++$+++ I'm not at liberty to say.
c03368 +++$+++ And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
c03368 +++$+++ In a storage facility.
c03368 +++$+++ And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
c03368 +++$+++ Yes, it would.
c03368 +++$+++ And may I see this storage facility?
c03368 +++$+++ No, you may not.
c03368 +++$+++ And why not, Mr. Venkman?
c03368 +++$+++ Because you didn't say the magic word.
c03368 +++$+++ The magic word is "please."
c13977 +++$+++ I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
c13977 +++$+++ No...
c13977 +++$+++ Somebody stole it.
c09201 +++$+++ Steering wheel.
c09201 +++$+++ Steering wheel.
c09201 +++$+++ Gear shift.
c09201 +++$+++ Gear shift.
c09201 +++$+++ Dashboard.
c15553 +++$+++ Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all.
c15553 +++$+++ Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
c15553 +++$+++ Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
c15553 +++$+++ What's Fleur-de-Lis?
c15553 +++$+++ Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
c18921 +++$+++ All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
c18921 +++$+++ Don't belong?
c18921 +++$+++ Do you always have to repeat?
c18921 +++$+++ Sorry.
c18921 +++$+++ Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
c18921 +++$+++ You think people hate you.
c18921 +++$+++ The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
c18921 +++$+++ I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?
c27399 +++$+++ Carlson!
c27399 +++$+++ Yes, sir?
c27399 +++$+++ Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
c27399 +++$+++ ... No!
c21859 +++$+++ Max, as I was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  I mean these offices and everything.
c21859 +++$+++ Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
c21859 +++$+++ But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
c21859 +++$+++ Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
c21859 +++$+++ Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
c21859 +++$+++ Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
c21859 +++$+++ Only if we ask him.
c16385 +++$+++ I want to hear the truth.
c16385 +++$+++ Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
c16385 +++$+++ Why do you think I blew up your condo?
c16385 +++$+++ Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat!  It's not a seminar!  You have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me.
c09044 +++$+++ Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
c09044 +++$+++ We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
c09044 +++$+++ Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
c09044 +++$+++ But not you.
c09044 +++$+++ There are days.
c09044 +++$+++ You don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, Picard.
c09044 +++$+++ In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
c09044 +++$+++ You give me more credit than I deserve. Of course, I'm tempted. Who wouldn't be?  But some of the blackest marks in the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I'd like to believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven't.
c23430 +++$+++ Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
c23430 +++$+++ I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
c23430 +++$+++ Okay.
c23430 +++$+++ This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
c23430 +++$+++ What's wrong? Is everything okay?
c23430 +++$+++ That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
c23430 +++$+++ Naw, not yet.  I want ye to give this to Mizz Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe there's a little somethin' to hep out. Hits what I've earned fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill Cox.
c08140 +++$+++ Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
c08140 +++$+++ I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
c08140 +++$+++ What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
c05591 +++$+++ You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
c05591 +++$+++ I wanna be with you today.
c05591 +++$+++ We can work.
c13635 +++$+++ Dil! Dil! What the fuck are you doing here?
c13635 +++$+++ I'm going home!
c13635 +++$+++ Thought you was fooling me. Thought you was leaving me.
c15393 +++$+++ Why... yes.
c15393 +++$+++ Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
c15393 +++$+++ I suppose.  It's very expensive.
c15393 +++$+++ It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
c15393 +++$+++ What are you, an angora wholesaler?
c15393 +++$+++ No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
c15393 +++$+++ Ah, c'mon!  Nobody does all that.
c15393 +++$+++ Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
c15393 +++$+++ You know, you're a very attractive girl.
c09462 +++$+++ I can't...
c09462 +++$+++ Please say it.
c09462 +++$+++ OK.
c10590 +++$+++ Sailor!
c10590 +++$+++ You up for that?
c10590 +++$+++ Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
c03742 +++$+++ Ooops.
c03742 +++$+++ Ooops.
c03742 +++$+++ Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
c03742 +++$+++ You startled me.
c18882 +++$+++ -- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
c18882 +++$+++ There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
c18882 +++$+++ I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
c18882 +++$+++ What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
c18882 +++$+++ In a manner of speaking.
c03371 +++$+++ Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
c03371 +++$+++ You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
c03371 +++$+++ Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
c03371 +++$+++ I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability.
c03371 +++$+++ Then my theory was correct.
c14681 +++$+++ The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
c14681 +++$+++ Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
c14681 +++$+++ Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
c14681 +++$+++ What's your plan of attack?
c14681 +++$+++ But who will they turn to for help?
c03877 +++$+++ It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
c03877 +++$+++ Where's that?
c03877 +++$+++ Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
c00236 +++$+++ They all like this in your family, father?
c00236 +++$+++ She's an exception..
c00236 +++$+++ Dallas. Korben Dallas.
c01082 +++$+++ Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
c01082 +++$+++ Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
c01082 +++$+++ I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
c17434 +++$+++ Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
c17434 +++$+++ Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
c17434 +++$+++ How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
c01400 +++$+++ Gal, you ain't right yet.
c01400 +++$+++ I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
c01400 +++$+++ How you let men treat ya like they do?
c01400 +++$+++ What?
c01400 +++$+++ These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
c01400 +++$+++ Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
c01400 +++$+++ You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
c01400 +++$+++ I've saved ya life, gal. I can do and say whatever the fuck I want.
c03695 +++$+++ What do you know about Michael?
c03695 +++$+++ I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
c03695 +++$+++ No, Dr. Loomis.  She's not the last night.
c13193 +++$+++ I didn't think you'd make it.
c13193 +++$+++ Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
c13193 +++$+++ There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
c13193 +++$+++ Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
c13193 +++$+++ Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.
c11834 +++$+++ Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
c11834 +++$+++ I could take after Dad, too.
c11834 +++$+++ You do. You're handsome and charming.
c11834 +++$+++ I meant he's a doctor.
c11834 +++$+++ That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
c11834 +++$+++ That'd be something.
c15664 +++$+++ This is not very good, is it?
c15664 +++$+++ No.
c15664 +++$+++ Shall we be all right?
c15664 +++$+++ Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
c10024 +++$+++ He said they're charging us with murder.
c10024 +++$+++ Eeuww.
c10024 +++$+++ Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
c01486 +++$+++ There's two reasons a man rejects help.  Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
c01486 +++$+++ Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
c01486 +++$+++ I work alone.
c18538 +++$+++ Oh, you two idiots! George, sit down and have dinner.
c18538 +++$+++ I've eaten.
c18538 +++$+++ I don't care. It's George's tux.
c04736 +++$+++ We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
c04736 +++$+++ What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
c04736 +++$+++ I've put extra men on, all along the way.
c04736 +++$+++ It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
c04736 +++$+++ I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her.
c18515 +++$+++ Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.
c18515 +++$+++ You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
c18515 +++$+++ Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
c25769 +++$+++ Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
c25769 +++$+++ Yes--is it all right if I come like this?
c25769 +++$+++ This time I'm really glad you showed up.
c25769 +++$+++ We'll let it go at that--
c25696 +++$+++ Who?
c25696 +++$+++ The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
c25696 +++$+++ The tennis player?
c25696 +++$+++ But you came. And you must forget everything--  except that you are here, Countess.
c17529 +++$+++ Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
c17529 +++$+++ Yeah.
c17529 +++$+++ No.
c11873 +++$+++ Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
c11873 +++$+++ Christ, it's a miracle I was even born!
c11873 +++$+++ Nothing. Look, I'll write it down for you, okay?
c18582 +++$+++ You're going out.
c18582 +++$+++ Yeah.
c18582 +++$+++ You're going sailing.
c18582 +++$+++ Maybe.
c18582 +++$+++ Take me.
c18582 +++$+++ No.
c18582 +++$+++ I want to go with you!
c18582 +++$+++ Quiet!  Shhh!
c18582 +++$+++ Okay, okay.  Close your door.
c09474 +++$+++ Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?
c09474 +++$+++ Thanks.
c09474 +++$+++ Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
c02198 +++$+++ Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
c02198 +++$+++ Yes on all counts.
c02198 +++$+++ I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
c02198 +++$+++ You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
c02198 +++$+++ I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
c02198 +++$+++ C'mere, I want to show you something.
c21979 +++$+++ They're filthy, Mother.
c21979 +++$+++ Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
c21979 +++$+++ I know, Mother.
c21979 +++$+++ But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
c21979 +++$+++ I am in awe of it, Mother.
c21979 +++$+++ I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
c21979 +++$+++ This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
c07423 +++$+++ When?
c07423 +++$+++ Late summer.
c07423 +++$+++ Thank you.
c17347 +++$+++ Excuse me, Professor Lambeau?
c17347 +++$+++ Yes.
c17347 +++$+++ I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
c17347 +++$+++ It's Saturday.
c17347 +++$+++ I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
c17347 +++$+++ Who proved the theorem.
c15946 +++$+++ Morning.
c15946 +++$+++ Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
c15946 +++$+++ How are you today?
c15946 +++$+++ That's good.
c22776 +++$+++ He's broken his pattern.
c22776 +++$+++ They've broken their pattern.
c22776 +++$+++ Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
c15483 +++$+++ You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
c15483 +++$+++ Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
c15483 +++$+++ As far as I know, they--
c25802 +++$+++ Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
c25802 +++$+++ Like it?
c25802 +++$+++ Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
c25802 +++$+++ Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
c25802 +++$+++ And you've put it over--haven't you?
c25802 +++$+++ Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
c25802 +++$+++ You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
c25802 +++$+++ No--not much--excepting--
c25802 +++$+++ Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
c25802 +++$+++ No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
c25802 +++$+++ I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
c25802 +++$+++ Do what--
c25802 +++$+++ You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
c25802 +++$+++ News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
c25802 +++$+++ It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
c25802 +++$+++ I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
c25802 +++$+++ I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
c25802 +++$+++ I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
c25802 +++$+++ Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
c25802 +++$+++ Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
c25802 +++$+++ Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
c25802 +++$+++ But not nice enough to marry--eh?
c25802 +++$+++ I'll never love anybody else.
c20310 +++$+++ He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
c20310 +++$+++ You don't know where Loretta is?
c20310 +++$+++ No idea.
c20310 +++$+++ Okay, I'll tell her.
c02476 +++$+++ Where do you live?
c02476 +++$+++ You're not a stalker or anything, right?
c02476 +++$+++ Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
c02476 +++$+++ You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
c02476 +++$+++ I'm not a stalker.
c02476 +++$+++ You know Wilmont?
c02476 +++$+++ Wilmont. Near the high school.
c17984 +++$+++ I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.
c17984 +++$+++ What?
c17984 +++$+++ You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
c17984 +++$+++ What's that?
c17984 +++$+++ This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
c17984 +++$+++ Stop knowing me so well.
c17984 +++$+++ I know it's at the high end of our range --
c17984 +++$+++ High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
c17984 +++$+++ But it's what we want.
c17984 +++$+++ You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
c17984 +++$+++ They don't expect to get what they're asking.  Let's make an offer.
c17984 +++$+++ You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
c17984 +++$+++ You could have a pool to cool off in.
c17984 +++$+++ It's a nice pool, isn't it?
c17984 +++$+++ It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
c21405 +++$+++ What a great kite.
c21405 +++$+++ I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
c21405 +++$+++ I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
c21405 +++$+++ Are you doing some kind of science project?
c21405 +++$+++ Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
c14600 +++$+++ We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
c14600 +++$+++ What about you?
c14600 +++$+++ Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
c11012 +++$+++ How much air-time have I got?
c11012 +++$+++ About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
c11012 +++$+++ We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
c26971 +++$+++ Of what?
c26971 +++$+++ Of him I think.
c26971 +++$+++ More or less.
c19118 +++$+++ I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
c19118 +++$+++ Jack Gordon.
c19118 +++$+++ No. Wait... Was she a great, fat person? I may have seen her, I'm not sure...
c20279 +++$+++ Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
c20279 +++$+++ What?
c20279 +++$+++ Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
c20279 +++$+++ I can't do that!
c20279 +++$+++ I'm in love with you!
c22689 +++$+++ Yes, Private.
c22689 +++$+++ Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
c22689 +++$+++ Yeah?
c19610 +++$+++ ...say it, Jimmy...
c19610 +++$+++ Do you know the answer to this?
c19610 +++$+++ I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
c04669 +++$+++ Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
c04669 +++$+++ Well, I wouldn't say --
c04669 +++$+++ Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
c04669 +++$+++ He --
c04669 +++$+++ Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
c04669 +++$+++ So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
c15605 +++$+++ Hey.
c15605 +++$+++ This guy's a fat-assed Rotarian gasbag.
c15605 +++$+++ Listen to him.
c22621 +++$+++ We been through that.
c22621 +++$+++ What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
c22621 +++$+++ I need my paycheck.
c22621 +++$+++ You can still work.
c22621 +++$+++ Find a new job.
c17792 +++$+++ Who does not?
c17792 +++$+++ If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor.
c17792 +++$+++ Take mine.  Ah. And is that your <u>wife</u>...  Signora.  Can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
c24676 +++$+++ Typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
c24676 +++$+++ TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
c24676 +++$+++ Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
c06633 +++$+++ I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
c06633 +++$+++ Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
c06633 +++$+++ I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
c16225 +++$+++ Victor, your scar --
c16225 +++$+++ I told you, I'm fine.  It's <u>you</u> I'm worried about.
c16225 +++$+++ Please, no apologies.  I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos.  You'll have round-the clock care.
c20694 +++$+++ Well, how about the shopping center?
c20694 +++$+++ Yes. She's pretty rested up.
c20694 +++$+++ Okay.
c03061 +++$+++ Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
c03061 +++$+++ You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
c03061 +++$+++ No.  We're all of us after something.  It's easy for me to fight for the common man.  My father could only dream that I would be... a general someday?  And what of my daughter or son?  I know what I'm after.  But now, with all this talk about compromise?  It means the rich will just be more wealthy and the common man has no hope.
c03061 +++$+++ But you are an aristocrat and a slave owner.  Sir.
c07836 +++$+++ Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
c07836 +++$+++ And what does he see?
c07836 +++$+++ And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
c12368 +++$+++ What?
c12368 +++$+++ I just wanted to say "hi."  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
c12368 +++$+++ Yeah.
c12368 +++$+++ How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
c12368 +++$+++ Why not?
c12368 +++$+++ Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
c12368 +++$+++ Who told you?
c12368 +++$+++ I'm right?
c12368 +++$+++ Who told you?
c12368 +++$+++ That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
c12368 +++$+++ Somebody told you.
c12368 +++$+++ Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
c12368 +++$+++ Maxine.
c05808 +++$+++ Andy, who is that guy?
c05808 +++$+++ I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
c05808 +++$+++ Dick Laurent?
c05808 +++$+++ Yes, I believe so.
c05808 +++$+++ He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
c27326 +++$+++ Nothing wrong with ketchup.
c27326 +++$+++ Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
c27326 +++$+++ Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
c27326 +++$+++ We should get back --  What?
c27326 +++$+++ We should get back to the lab.  You okay, Jon?
c00188 +++$+++ You're in a hurry.
c00188 +++$+++ Yeah, i been waiting three years.
c00188 +++$+++ You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
c00188 +++$+++ No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
c00188 +++$+++ No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
c00861 +++$+++ ...to the office this afternoon.
c00861 +++$+++ Why?
c00861 +++$+++ Just...say...no!
c00861 +++$+++ Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!
c00527 +++$+++ So what was that other word for Human... Slow ka?
c00527 +++$+++ Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
c00527 +++$+++ And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
c00527 +++$+++ Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
c22791 +++$+++ How are you? You weren't in class. I called as soon as I heard...
c22791 +++$+++ I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
c22791 +++$+++ Don't ask what you can do. No coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
c20816 +++$+++ 'You Will Anderson?
c20816 +++$+++ Who're you?
c20816 +++$+++ I'm Duff.
c20816 +++$+++ Wouldn't have known you.
c20816 +++$+++ Wouldn't have known you.
c20816 +++$+++ What's on your mind?
c20816 +++$+++ Nothing. Heard you were in town.
c20816 +++$+++ Yeah. That's right.
c23761 +++$+++ I do what I gotta do to survive.
c23761 +++$+++ You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
c23761 +++$+++ I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
c23761 +++$+++ You wish!
c17404 +++$+++ Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
c17404 +++$+++ Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
c17404 +++$+++ Watch me pass that Chevvy.
c15273 +++$+++ You found my treasure? Why didn't you tell me.
c15273 +++$+++ Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
c15273 +++$+++ Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
c21652 +++$+++ Attributed?
c21652 +++$+++ Of course.
c21652 +++$+++ It needn't concern you, Edward. James has got some news.  He needs a poet's advice.
c12535 +++$+++ How many of you are there?
c12535 +++$+++ A few thousand scattered about the globe. In the past, we've had to restrict our numbers for fear of discovery. That won't be necessary after tonight.
c12535 +++$+++ What happens then?
c12535 +++$+++ The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
c12535 +++$+++ That's right. The answers were there all along, of course, scribbled down in the forgotten languages of my kind. Waiting for someone with the patience to decipher them. My elders were foolish enough to dismiss them as wives tales. But I knew better.  Imagine my surprise when Blade turned out to be the key which would set that force free.
c07080 +++$+++ What'd he say?
c07080 +++$+++ What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
c07080 +++$+++ I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
c11022 +++$+++ How do you know my name?
c11022 +++$+++ It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
c11022 +++$+++ And what is your name?
c11022 +++$+++ Phoebe.
c11022 +++$+++ Phoebe?
c11022 +++$+++ Why not? Tell me, Phoebe, do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?
c05638 +++$+++ I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
c05638 +++$+++ The kind where there isn't really an answer.
c05638 +++$+++ I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
c10018 +++$+++ This is so beautiful.
c10018 +++$+++ Gosh.  It sure is.
c10018 +++$+++ Well, you got it now.
c07208 +++$+++ Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
c07208 +++$+++ I know that...
c07208 +++$+++ You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
c13570 +++$+++ Who'd ever think, to look at you?
c13570 +++$+++ As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
c13570 +++$+++ We had a backup plan.  But I knew you'd come through for me.
c20493 +++$+++ Are you Matthew Parker ?
c20493 +++$+++ Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
c20493 +++$+++ Hey , Hey !
c22493 +++$+++ There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
c22493 +++$+++ Where?
c22493 +++$+++ He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
c14451 +++$+++ He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
c14451 +++$+++ It does.
c14451 +++$+++ Do you find him attractive?
c14451 +++$+++ He's very pale. Covered with scars.
c14451 +++$+++ Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
c14451 +++$+++ No. But when he's in that car...
c14451 +++$+++ Have you seen his penis?
c14451 +++$+++ Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him? Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would you kiss him in that car? Describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen? Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan's semen must be very salty...
c01713 +++$+++ Really. OK, Dad. But seriously, Anthony. These are fast shoes.
c01713 +++$+++ You've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, Dignan.  In fifth grade Dignan used to wear cowboy boots for P.E.
c01713 +++$+++ That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
c01713 +++$+++ You were spoiled rotten.
c01251 +++$+++ Charming Schuvaloff.
c01251 +++$+++ Black-eyed Sczortarska.
c01251 +++$+++ Dark Valdez.
c01251 +++$+++ Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
c01251 +++$+++ Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
c01251 +++$+++ And he doesn't care about me?
c01251 +++$+++ He is only curious to know who you are.
c01251 +++$+++ If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
c01251 +++$+++ He loves me, as I love you.
c01251 +++$+++ Will he wish to know the details of this night?
c01251 +++$+++ Tender Hegenheim.
c11613 +++$+++ Why the hell you wanna go up to Nu Mung Ba for?
c11613 +++$+++ I got bored in Saigon.
c11613 +++$+++ What's the furthest you been in?
c11613 +++$+++ Haiphong.
c11613 +++$+++ Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
c11613 +++$+++ No. Walked.
c11613 +++$+++ What'd you do for supplies?
c11613 +++$+++ Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
c11613 +++$+++ Can you trust them?
c11613 +++$+++ No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
c11613 +++$+++ Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter Kurtz commanded a Green Beret detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
c11613 +++$+++ When did you hear?
c11613 +++$+++ 'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
c11613 +++$+++ Who knows.
c11613 +++$+++ Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
c11613 +++$+++ I met him.
c11613 +++$+++ Don't you agree?
c11613 +++$+++ He musta changed !  I got to get into the Nung River, here or here.
c11613 +++$+++ That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
c11613 +++$+++ Hairy ?
c11613 +++$+++ I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
c11613 +++$+++ So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
c11613 +++$+++ And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
c11613 +++$+++ I met him.
c11613 +++$+++ You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
c11613 +++$+++ What about this point here?
c00705 +++$+++ Excuse me.  Yes?
c00705 +++$+++ Roger Mathison, Doctor.
c00705 +++$+++ What here?
c00705 +++$+++ Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
c16536 +++$+++ You've been staying in a motel all this time?
c16536 +++$+++ For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
c16536 +++$+++ I don't understand why you had to stay in a motel. There's more than enough room here.
c16536 +++$+++ Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money...  I didn't have no number to call, you know.  So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
c16536 +++$+++ Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
c16536 +++$+++ Not at all.
c24411 +++$+++ What's happening?
c24411 +++$+++ I'm taking you to the hospital.
c24411 +++$+++ Later.
c07257 +++$+++ That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
c07257 +++$+++ Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
c07257 +++$+++ More than you know. Is there anything else?
c07257 +++$+++ Good.
c15163 +++$+++ I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
c15163 +++$+++ They look like good kids.
c15163 +++$+++ They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
c15163 +++$+++ Special to me, too.
c15163 +++$+++ You like me?
c15163 +++$+++ Sure - we like you.
c15163 +++$+++ You seem like a likable enough guy. It's hard to judge.
c05124 +++$+++ There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
c05124 +++$+++ You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
c05124 +++$+++ There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
c05124 +++$+++ A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
c05124 +++$+++ A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
c05124 +++$+++ We towed Ben Gardner's boat in, Larry; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up.
c16426 +++$+++ Get control of yourself!
c16426 +++$+++ That's what I'm doin'!
c16426 +++$+++ I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
c17801 +++$+++ Thank you, Cordell.
c17801 +++$+++ ...but will that satisfy you?
c17801 +++$+++ Why should <u>you</u> care?
c17801 +++$+++ It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
c17801 +++$+++ ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
c17801 +++$+++ <u>Yes</u>.
c17801 +++$+++ You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
c17801 +++$+++ Explain in depth the plan we have for him.  Until tomorrow.
c15427 +++$+++ What?
c15427 +++$+++ The doctor said you were having sex.
c15427 +++$+++ To you? In front of him?  With the...
c15427 +++$+++ Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
c15427 +++$+++ Oh my god! On TV!
c15427 +++$+++ Why? How...
c15427 +++$+++ One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
c15427 +++$+++ But Al is your husband now!
c15427 +++$+++ Apparently, neither can Hank. What the hell did you do to him?
c20053 +++$+++ How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
c20053 +++$+++ What'd Neptune tell you?
c20053 +++$+++ Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load...
c05137 +++$+++ Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
c05137 +++$+++ Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
c05137 +++$+++ I'll try to drop by later.
c10389 +++$+++ Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
c10389 +++$+++ What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
c10389 +++$+++ You're right. There's no one here.
c10389 +++$+++ Norma, are you alright?
c06901 +++$+++ Any trouble?
c06901 +++$+++ No.
c06901 +++$+++ He carried on some; kicked.
c05892 +++$+++ No. That's not possible! If we had landed, we all would have been awakened.
c05892 +++$+++ Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
c05892 +++$+++ What's he doing? Where's he taking us? He may be a maniac for all we know.
c03085 +++$+++ How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
c03085 +++$+++ What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
c03085 +++$+++ In just a second. Two...
c03085 +++$+++ Three.
c19333 +++$+++ I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
c19333 +++$+++ They go together.
c19333 +++$+++ I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
c19333 +++$+++ Who?
c19333 +++$+++ Nix.
c19333 +++$+++ Nix?
c19333 +++$+++ Like in nothing.  Nobody.  Nix.
c19333 +++$+++ I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.
c25216 +++$+++ Where are you from, Henrietta?
c25216 +++$+++ Johana... New York.
c25216 +++$+++ He doesn't hear too well.
c18425 +++$+++ Let's call that a start.
c18425 +++$+++ I can't do it.
c18425 +++$+++ Kill me if you will, but I can't do this...
c22586 +++$+++ Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
c22586 +++$+++ All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
c22586 +++$+++ If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
c25881 +++$+++ Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
c25881 +++$+++ I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
c25881 +++$+++ That's reassuring.
c25881 +++$+++ Let's take a look at the body.
c03555 +++$+++ Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
c03555 +++$+++ What, Doctor?
c03555 +++$+++ A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
c03555 +++$+++ I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
c03555 +++$+++ You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
c03555 +++$+++ Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
c03555 +++$+++ I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
c03555 +++$+++ I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.
c23963 +++$+++ Warp Drive as soon as possible, Mr. Scott.
c23963 +++$+++ Captain, it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place. It will happen again if we don't correct it.
c23963 +++$+++ Aye, we understand that sir! We're doing our best.
c05731 +++$+++ Hello, Cassius.
c05731 +++$+++ All right. Let me out.
c05731 +++$+++ You mother...
c19659 +++$+++ I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
c19659 +++$+++ No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
c19659 +++$+++ Is that the king of king you wish me to be?  Or do you say this because of your son?
c19659 +++$+++ Porthos told me.
c07607 +++$+++ Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
c07607 +++$+++ Right.
c07607 +++$+++ Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
c07607 +++$+++ Right.
c07607 +++$+++ Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
c07607 +++$+++ Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
c07607 +++$+++ Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
c07607 +++$+++ And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
c07607 +++$+++ What could I be?
c07607 +++$+++ You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
c07607 +++$+++ All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
c16101 +++$+++ Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
c16101 +++$+++ Another five years, huh?
c16101 +++$+++ Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
c16101 +++$+++ He's got blood in his eye.
c01350 +++$+++ So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
c01350 +++$+++ Yes.
c01350 +++$+++ Yes.
c15512 +++$+++ Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
c15512 +++$+++ No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
c15512 +++$+++ You use words like that, you might make me mad.
c15512 +++$+++ Yes.  But do you know?
c15512 +++$+++ Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
c15512 +++$+++ That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
c15512 +++$+++ Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
c15512 +++$+++ I don't know.  I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
c15512 +++$+++ Did Lefferts have a boyfriend?
c15512 +++$+++ Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
c15512 +++$+++ How'd she meet Patchett?
c15512 +++$+++ Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
c15512 +++$+++ Tell me about Patchett.
c15512 +++$+++ He's waiting for you to mention mention.
c15512 +++$+++ You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
c15512 +++$+++ Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
c25454 +++$+++ I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
c25454 +++$+++ He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
c25454 +++$+++ Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear. He thought he was gonna take over General Electric.  Some Chantoozie woke him up, though, and he put the feds on me.
c25454 +++$+++ You mean you blew it.
c25454 +++$+++ Luther didn't tell me you had a big mouth.
c25454 +++$+++ No, I lammed it around for a while while things cooled off.  Philly, Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.
c19192 +++$+++ Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
c19192 +++$+++ The infirmary?...
c19192 +++$+++ We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
c05017 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
c05017 +++$+++ This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
c05017 +++$+++ The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
c05017 +++$+++ Oh yeah? What am I - Perry Mason here?
c01857 +++$+++ We can't stop!
c01857 +++$+++ They've tricked us.
c01857 +++$+++ What's the crazy man saying, Lord?
c01857 +++$+++ The dogs have a scent. My scent. Someone must have given it to them.
c01857 +++$+++ Exactly.
c09514 +++$+++ Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
c09514 +++$+++ Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
c09514 +++$+++ Search me. I guess we're abandoned.
c10859 +++$+++ Do you know a Marie?
c10859 +++$+++ No... do you?
c10859 +++$+++ I don't know.
c06958 +++$+++ Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
c06958 +++$+++ He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
c06958 +++$+++ Nobody's gonna kill you.
c24601 +++$+++ They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
c24601 +++$+++ I won't lie.
c24601 +++$+++ I don't want you to lie.
c24601 +++$+++ The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
c24601 +++$+++ There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
c24601 +++$+++ I'm absolutely positive.
c16220 +++$+++ You're <u>happy</u> for me and Victor.
c16220 +++$+++ I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
c16220 +++$+++ Passion.
c14353 +++$+++ Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
c14353 +++$+++ If you came back.
c14353 +++$+++ If you came back... you'd only be four years older -- but over 50 years would have passed on Earth.
c14353 +++$+++ And everybody you care about would be dead and buried.
c08400 +++$+++ First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
c08400 +++$+++ What color is it supposed to be?
c08400 +++$+++ Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
c08400 +++$+++ Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
c05937 +++$+++ Well, it wasn't in the jar...
c05937 +++$+++ Did it leave?
c05937 +++$+++ Oh shit!
c00197 +++$+++ Well?
c00197 +++$+++ It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
c00197 +++$+++ This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
c00197 +++$+++ Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
c00197 +++$+++ If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
c00197 +++$+++ Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
c05752 +++$+++ You callin' me a thief, my man?
c05752 +++$+++ No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
c05752 +++$+++ I don't know?
c02208 +++$+++ Who are you?
c02208 +++$+++ My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
c02208 +++$+++ You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
c02208 +++$+++ With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
c02208 +++$+++ How do I know you're telling the truth?
c02208 +++$+++ He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
c02208 +++$+++ Look, I don't know what you want--
c02208 +++$+++ I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
c02208 +++$+++ And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
c02208 +++$+++ Oh?
c02208 +++$+++ Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
c02208 +++$+++ How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
c02208 +++$+++ Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
c02208 +++$+++ You're also a fool.
c02208 +++$+++ Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
c23901 +++$+++ When we get Artoo's message to them, you think they'll try to rescue the princess?
c23901 +++$+++ I doubt it.  It would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding. I know your feelings.  You'd best forget them.  It's for your own good. There will be no saving her from the prisons of Alderaan.  It's the heart of the Sith.  The Bogan Force is the most heavy there.
c23901 +++$+++ These are doubtful times.  The Empire has grown bold in its disregard of the...
c06716 +++$+++ You got off easy.
c06716 +++$+++ Will you wait for me?
c06716 +++$+++ We're only talking about six weeks.
c06716 +++$+++ Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
c26792 +++$+++ Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
c26792 +++$+++ I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
c26792 +++$+++ You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
c26792 +++$+++ Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
c26792 +++$+++ What does that mean?
c26792 +++$+++ Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
c26792 +++$+++ Sounds to me like a well--educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
c26792 +++$+++ Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert. He's got to make a move sometime, and we've got to be ready when he does.  Welcome to police work. You better like coffee.
c01312 +++$+++ That's because we didn't have a wedding. Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. She was engaged to somebody else.
c01312 +++$+++ I never knew.
c01312 +++$+++ Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
c01312 +++$+++ Well, it's not a short one.
c06461 +++$+++ We must be friends, Charlie.
c06461 +++$+++ Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
c06461 +++$+++ The terms will be mine.
c06461 +++$+++ The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
c06461 +++$+++ What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
c19771 +++$+++ I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
c19771 +++$+++ I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a horrible person.
c19771 +++$+++ Andy, you're not horrible.  You're just... complicated.
c19771 +++$+++ Andy... there is no real you.
c22092 +++$+++ Been waiting long?
c22092 +++$+++ Just got here.
c22092 +++$+++ How'd we do?
c22092 +++$+++ A.D. is a C.P.A.
c22092 +++$+++ Come again... ?
c22092 +++$+++ Maybe it's enough.
c21278 +++$+++ My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
c21278 +++$+++ I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
c21278 +++$+++ Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
c21278 +++$+++ Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
c21278 +++$+++ Unless you wanna tell me.
c21278 +++$+++ He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
c21278 +++$+++ One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
c21278 +++$+++ I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
c21278 +++$+++ I just thought maybe you and me could--
c00541 +++$+++ You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
c00541 +++$+++ Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
c00541 +++$+++ Just tell them what happened.  The important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
c06363 +++$+++ So, McCall, how come you ended up in San Francisco?
c06363 +++$+++ They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
c06363 +++$+++ Recruited you from where?
c06363 +++$+++ National Marksman Competition.
c06363 +++$+++ With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
c06363 +++$+++ Furthest point I could find from New York.
c06363 +++$+++ You don't like New York?
c06363 +++$+++ Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
c06363 +++$+++ You'd never been out of New York?
c06363 +++$+++ Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
c06363 +++$+++ How did you like Toronto?
c06363 +++$+++ It was okay.
c06363 +++$+++ You're a real excitable sort, aren't you?
c06363 +++$+++ You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
c06363 +++$+++ I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
c06363 +++$+++ I'm not sure.
c26626 +++$+++ No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
c26626 +++$+++ I need you.
c26626 +++$+++ I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
c19956 +++$+++ Yes.
c19956 +++$+++ Death!
c19956 +++$+++ That's me.
c19956 +++$+++ The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?
c23698 +++$+++ What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
c23698 +++$+++ I don't know, dude.
c23698 +++$+++ That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
c23698 +++$+++ She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me!
c05303 +++$+++ Hello.
c05303 +++$+++ Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
c05303 +++$+++ You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
c05303 +++$+++ Very good.
c05303 +++$+++ You're next move should have been e2- e3.
c05303 +++$+++ I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
c05303 +++$+++ What word did you leave last night?
c05303 +++$+++ They think that you and I are doing this together.
c10604 +++$+++ Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
c10604 +++$+++ Where?
c10604 +++$+++ I'm goin'.
c26066 +++$+++ No, no, it's not possible.
c26066 +++$+++ Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
c26066 +++$+++ Bring it closer so that I might join with it. Do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
c23152 +++$+++ Why not?
c23152 +++$+++ ... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
c23152 +++$+++ And?
c23152 +++$+++ Did you?
c03023 +++$+++ I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
c03023 +++$+++ But there it is!...
c03023 +++$+++ A model, only as big as this.
c03023 +++$+++ But... Inside, I have seen-
c03023 +++$+++ Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
c03023 +++$+++ It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
c01162 +++$+++ ...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
c01162 +++$+++ I'm sorry I'm late.
c01162 +++$+++ I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
c24942 +++$+++ This huge police presence tonight isn't necessary, Lieutenant.  You'll just scare people off.  I can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  It's state of the art.
c24942 +++$+++ The cops are non-negotiable, Ippolito.  Why don't you just tell me how this space station works.
c24942 +++$+++ It's fool proof, basically.  I designed this whole thing myself. Every valuable object in the Museum carries a small electronic chip.  If anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
c24942 +++$+++ That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
c24942 +++$+++ In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
c24942 +++$+++ You don't know much about computers, Lieutenant.  There are safeguards built in.  We have back-up systems with redundancies.  There's no way these computers can fail.
c06759 +++$+++ I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
c06759 +++$+++ I know you did.
c06759 +++$+++ I knew you'd know.
c06759 +++$+++ I know you knew I'd know.
c06759 +++$+++ Of course.
c10252 +++$+++ Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
c10252 +++$+++ Rekall?
c10252 +++$+++ They sell fake memories.
c10252 +++$+++ Oh, Rekall.
c10252 +++$+++ "RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
c07761 +++$+++ I have a proposition.
c07761 +++$+++ You always do.
c07761 +++$+++ Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
c07761 +++$+++ I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
c07761 +++$+++ "Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
c07761 +++$+++ That's enough.
c07761 +++$+++ You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
c07761 +++$+++ THEN BUGGER ME!
c10979 +++$+++ You know, it's fantastic -- the human race has gone this long without ever encountering another advanced life form, and now we run into a veritable zoo.
c10979 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c10979 +++$+++ Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
c10979 +++$+++ Maybe it wasn't always dead.
c11261 +++$+++ People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too
c11261 +++$+++ What happened to your parents?
c11261 +++$+++ I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
c11261 +++$+++ You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
c11261 +++$+++ Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
c14751 +++$+++ PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?
c14751 +++$+++ It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
c14751 +++$+++ That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
c14751 +++$+++ What else is there?
c14751 +++$+++ It's not just in my head.
c13508 +++$+++ God-damn..
c13508 +++$+++ What did you say?
c13508 +++$+++ I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
c07662 +++$+++ Can I ask you a question?
c07662 +++$+++ Yes.
c07662 +++$+++ How come I'm still in black and white?
c07662 +++$+++ What?
c07662 +++$+++ Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
c07662 +++$+++ What?
c15964 +++$+++ I love you Rags. We'll have a good day yeah?
c15964 +++$+++ You can bring Mr. Dennings if you like.
c15964 +++$+++ Mr. Dennings?
c15964 +++$+++ Well you know it's okay.
c15964 +++$+++ Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
c15964 +++$+++ You like him.
c15964 +++$+++ Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
c15964 +++$+++ Your not gonna marry him are you?
c15964 +++$+++ Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
c15964 +++$+++ What?
c15964 +++$+++ Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
c15964 +++$+++ But you like him.
c15964 +++$+++ Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
c15964 +++$+++ Do you not like him like daddy?
c15964 +++$+++ Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
c15964 +++$+++ Well I heard differently.
c15964 +++$+++ Oh you did. What did you hear?
c15964 +++$+++ I don't know, I just thought.
c15964 +++$+++ Well your thinking's not so good.
c15964 +++$+++ How do you know?
c15964 +++$+++ Okay.
c08822 +++$+++ It's never too early to be clever. Describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
c08822 +++$+++ Huh?
c08822 +++$+++ Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
c08822 +++$+++ I-- uh--
c08822 +++$+++ Uh is a good start.
c08822 +++$+++ Oh.  Well, I hate you and everyone who looks like you.
c24457 +++$+++ He really was!
c24457 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c24457 +++$+++ Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
c14362 +++$+++ You have a question, Dr. Arroway?
c14362 +++$+++ I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
c14362 +++$+++ It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
c14362 +++$+++ Call it xenophobic paranoia.  Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this?  This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
c14362 +++$+++ Y'know what?  Fine.  I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
c05636 +++$+++ I loved him too much.
c05636 +++$+++ After everything he did to you and your mom?
c05636 +++$+++ That's so weird...
c13863 +++$+++ Yeah, I just....
c13863 +++$+++ Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
c13863 +++$+++ And only then does our noble friend realize...
c13863 +++$+++ Let me have those.
c10558 +++$+++ Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
c10558 +++$+++ You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
c10558 +++$+++ You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
c10558 +++$+++ Am I scarin' ya?... Your pussy wet?... Come on... is it?...  Hey, don't jump back so slow... I thought you was a bunny... Bunny jump fast - you jump back slow... Mean somethin', don't it?... Means somethin' to me... Means you want Bobby Peru... You want Bobby Peru to fuck you hard baby - open you up like a Christmas present.
c07106 +++$+++ How many?
c07106 +++$+++ Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And eight wounded.
c07106 +++$+++ Jesus Christ!
c07106 +++$+++ Shit, the press doesn't care about the facts.  Cronkite's sticking it to me. It's their first big hit on Richard Nixon.
c05085 +++$+++ I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
c05085 +++$+++ You come home with me.
c05085 +++$+++ Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
c24235 +++$+++ Hey!
c24235 +++$+++ Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
c24235 +++$+++ No I quit.
c24235 +++$+++ Hey, you said you did a video?
c24235 +++$+++ Yup.
c24235 +++$+++ What's it about?
c24235 +++$+++ It's really not about anything.
c24235 +++$+++ Oh. Well, what's it on?
c24235 +++$+++ A cloud.
c24235 +++$+++ A cloud?
c24235 +++$+++ Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
c24235 +++$+++ Oh.
c24235 +++$+++ I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
c24235 +++$+++ Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
c24235 +++$+++ You can see it. Whenever you want. Don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
c24235 +++$+++ Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
c24235 +++$+++ Your a nurse?
c24235 +++$+++ No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
c24235 +++$+++ Any gunshot victims?
c24235 +++$+++ Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
c24235 +++$+++ Sounds like a bummer.
c24235 +++$+++ Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
c24235 +++$+++ Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
c24235 +++$+++ Right now?
c24235 +++$+++ Yeah.
c24235 +++$+++ I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
c24235 +++$+++ Do you wanna go to the van?
c24235 +++$+++ Now?
c24235 +++$+++ Yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
c24235 +++$+++ Okay, whatever you want.
c12431 +++$+++ What, baby?
c12431 +++$+++ She left me. She's gone again.
c12431 +++$+++ She was my best thing.
c03130 +++$+++ That why you came over here, to ask me that?
c03130 +++$+++ I want to know.
c03130 +++$+++ Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
c19329 +++$+++ If he hadn't found that Deputy job, I believe Buddy might've gone down the other path, got into some serious trouble. Settled him right down. That and your mother. 'Course he had that other one later.
c19329 +++$+++ Another woman?
c19329 +++$+++ Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
c19329 +++$+++ The other one? Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one. Your head's all crowded up--here it is--
c07237 +++$+++ Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
c07237 +++$+++ I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
c07237 +++$+++ Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
c07237 +++$+++ Make sure it's elevated...
c07237 +++$+++ You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
c09278 +++$+++ My God, Lenny.  What is it?
c09278 +++$+++ Black.  Jack.
c09278 +++$+++ Blackjack?  I don't understand--
c09278 +++$+++ Are you sure it's real?
c23787 +++$+++ This is a vicious cycle.
c23787 +++$+++ I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
c23787 +++$+++ Isn't this technically a scooter?
c23787 +++$+++ When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
c23787 +++$+++ Kinda tough on the butt.
c23787 +++$+++ Everything has it's drawbacks.
c23787 +++$+++ Where did your brother escape from?
c23787 +++$+++ The mental hospital.
c23787 +++$+++ What does he do?
c23787 +++$+++ He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
c23787 +++$+++ It's a vicious cycle.
c21476 +++$+++ Tell me about the sounds. You told them you heard something right before....  If you don't talk to me, Johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
c21476 +++$+++ 'Mean the whispers?
c21476 +++$+++ The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
c05327 +++$+++ And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
c05327 +++$+++ We're going to work on the message.
c05327 +++$+++ This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
c05327 +++$+++ You don't have a shred of evidence!
c09983 +++$+++ What?!  Parole officer?  You mean you're a criminal?
c09983 +++$+++ Well, not anymore, Thelma, except for bustin' parole, I haven't done one wrong thing.
c09983 +++$+++ What did ya do?
c09983 +++$+++ I'm a robber.
c09983 +++$+++ You're a bank robber?
c09983 +++$+++ Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
c09983 +++$+++ What?
c09983 +++$+++ Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
c09983 +++$+++ How?
c09983 +++$+++ Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
c09983 +++$+++ No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
c09983 +++$+++ Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
c09983 +++$+++ Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
c06310 +++$+++ How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
c06310 +++$+++ I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
c06310 +++$+++ Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
c06310 +++$+++ Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, but--there you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.
c23914 +++$+++ What makes you think... you'll make... squad leader, Rico ?
c23914 +++$+++ Something... I've got...you don't.
c23914 +++$+++ It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
c08718 +++$+++ Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
c08718 +++$+++ What!?
c08718 +++$+++ Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
c08718 +++$+++ Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
c08718 +++$+++ -- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
c08718 +++$+++ Fuck you.
c04845 +++$+++ ...Oswald?
c04845 +++$+++ No, I did not.
c04845 +++$+++ ...ever called Dean Andrews?
c04845 +++$+++ No, I did not.
c04845 +++$+++ ...and have you ever met David Ferrie?
c04845 +++$+++ No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
c04845 +++$+++ ...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
c04845 +++$+++ Thank you... Mr. Shaw.
c22088 +++$+++ I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
c22088 +++$+++ First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
c22088 +++$+++ You know what I mean.
c22088 +++$+++ Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
c22088 +++$+++ All I'm saying is, your little Bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper couldn't get out.
c22252 +++$+++ Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
c22252 +++$+++ Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
c22252 +++$+++ By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
c22252 +++$+++ A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
c22252 +++$+++ Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
c22252 +++$+++ Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
c22252 +++$+++ This night you shall behold him at our feast; Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face, And find delight writ there with beauty's pen; This precious book of love, this unbound lover, To beautify him, only lacks a cover: So shall you share all that he doth possess, By having him, making yourself no less.
c22252 +++$+++ Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
c03980 +++$+++ I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
c03980 +++$+++ No Dad.
c03980 +++$+++ You'd like the house.
c03980 +++$+++ Do you want me to come over?
c20114 +++$+++ What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
c20114 +++$+++ Cat, ah!  Ayip!
c20114 +++$+++ You're ayip!
c20114 +++$+++ Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
c20114 +++$+++ But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
c20114 +++$+++ Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
c03929 +++$+++ What took you so long?
c03929 +++$+++ C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
c03929 +++$+++ What are you, a Boy Scout?
c03929 +++$+++ Could've fooled me. Go away.
c02079 +++$+++ Look at you... You want to go.
c02079 +++$+++ For what? A couple hundred bucks?
c02079 +++$+++ I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
c02079 +++$+++ It's what I do. It's my job.
c02079 +++$+++ Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
c02079 +++$+++ Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
c02079 +++$+++ Do you have something to prove?
c02079 +++$+++ Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
c02079 +++$+++ I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
c02079 +++$+++ Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
c02079 +++$+++ Whatever. But you... I get the feeling you could have bullshitted your way into anything. So why this?
c02079 +++$+++ I'm good at it. Lying, cheating, manipulating... I'm good at it.
c02079 +++$+++ It's more than that.
c02079 +++$+++ Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
c02079 +++$+++ So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
c02079 +++$+++ No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
c02079 +++$+++ Intuition.
c21152 +++$+++ I have to talk to her.
c21152 +++$+++ She's not here.
c21152 +++$+++ Where is she?
c21152 +++$+++ No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??
c02760 +++$+++ I'm going back to the hotel.
c02760 +++$+++ Good.
c02760 +++$+++ As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
c19965 +++$+++ All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
c19965 +++$+++ You think Drew will go for it?
c19965 +++$+++ Sir, I'll deliver the package.
c00418 +++$+++ Who are you?
c00418 +++$+++ I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
c00418 +++$+++ He's asleep. We were up very late.
c00418 +++$+++ Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
c00418 +++$+++ Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
c00418 +++$+++ Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
c00418 +++$+++ Something about my father?
c00418 +++$+++ Can't it wait, then?
c26633 +++$+++ Please drink your coffee.
c26633 +++$+++ I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
c26633 +++$+++ I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
c26633 +++$+++ You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
c26633 +++$+++ You like it, too.
c03494 +++$+++ I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
c03494 +++$+++ Let's drop it.
c03494 +++$+++ We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
c03494 +++$+++ Benjamin?
c03494 +++$+++ I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
c03494 +++$+++ Yes.
c03494 +++$+++ You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
c03494 +++$+++ I wouldn't know.
c03494 +++$+++ Well, I'm not.
c03494 +++$+++ You're not.
c03494 +++$+++ No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
c03494 +++$+++ And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
c16787 +++$+++ Have you seen Tamara?
c16787 +++$+++ No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
c16787 +++$+++ But she might be in trouble...
c16787 +++$+++ I don't care about being hip anymore.
c13439 +++$+++ Excuse me.
c13439 +++$+++ What?
c13439 +++$+++ Is this yours? Your pen?
c13439 +++$+++ Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
c13439 +++$+++ Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
c02870 +++$+++ Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to you?
c02870 +++$+++ You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
c02870 +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
c09903 +++$+++ I've been working.
c09903 +++$+++ I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
c09903 +++$+++ I'm sorry, David.
c09903 +++$+++ Then why are you here?
c11127 +++$+++ Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
c11127 +++$+++ I feel right now like there's one burning in me.
c11127 +++$+++ When's the audition?
c11127 +++$+++ A couple of weeks.
c11127 +++$+++ I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
c11127 +++$+++ Would you?
c11127 +++$+++ Anything to help you out, Max.
c11127 +++$+++ This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
c11127 +++$+++ Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
c11127 +++$+++ Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
c24650 +++$+++ Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
c24650 +++$+++ Are you finished?
c24650 +++$+++ No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
c24650 +++$+++ Not "we", Sidney, you!
c24650 +++$+++ Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
c20808 +++$+++ Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
c20808 +++$+++ You will.
c20808 +++$+++ Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
c20808 +++$+++ They won't.
c20808 +++$+++ I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
c20808 +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm not really thinkin' about it. Anyway, don't want those white guys laughin' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out.
c26782 +++$+++ He's developing a hemisphere imbalance.
c26782 +++$+++ Talk so I can understand.
c26782 +++$+++ Then fix it.
c00571 +++$+++ No! No! No!
c00571 +++$+++ Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
c00571 +++$+++ Where?
c00571 +++$+++ Fartsbishop!
c24920 +++$+++ ...Probity.
c24920 +++$+++ Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
c24920 +++$+++ Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
c24920 +++$+++ Yeah, the best.
c10284 +++$+++ Reckon he hated Perfection more than us?  You suppose he <u>wanted</u> to kill himself?
c10284 +++$+++ If he did, why didn't he use his damn shotgun?
c10284 +++$+++ Maybe he just couldn't pull the trigger...
c10284 +++$+++ Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do?  Camp out down below and just wait for him to die?
c21749 +++$+++ Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
c21749 +++$+++ Vivian...
c21749 +++$+++ Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
c21749 +++$+++ Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
c21749 +++$+++ I'll call you a cab.  If you want the clothes, pack them up.
c00184 +++$+++ Now how's your memory doin'?
c00184 +++$+++ Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
c00184 +++$+++ I don't give a shit who you ask.
c03260 +++$+++ So, why did you bring this along?
c03260 +++$+++ I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
c03260 +++$+++ I'm not holding my breath in that department.
c14660 +++$+++ What year are you in?
c14660 +++$+++ I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
c14660 +++$+++ It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
c16470 +++$+++ What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
c16470 +++$+++ <u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
c16470 +++$+++ Then what do you want to stay with me for?
c05687 +++$+++ Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
c05687 +++$+++ Here I am.
c05687 +++$+++ Guess we better get going, huh?
c05687 +++$+++ Still got that ten dollars?
c05687 +++$+++ Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
c05687 +++$+++ That jelly you were talking to right here?
c05687 +++$+++ She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
c05687 +++$+++ So you made a generous contribution.
c05687 +++$+++ What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
c05687 +++$+++ That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
c05687 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c05687 +++$+++ While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
c05687 +++$+++ You lost all our money in a card game?
c05687 +++$+++ He even got my daddy's watch.
c05687 +++$+++ We've still got 36 cases of rum. That's better than money.
c18942 +++$+++ What's the matter?
c18942 +++$+++ What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
c18942 +++$+++ If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
c18942 +++$+++ But if it's someone else I do.
c12465 +++$+++ And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
c12465 +++$+++ Oh?
c12465 +++$+++ Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
c12465 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c12465 +++$+++ Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
c12465 +++$+++ Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl. Drive around.  The occasional acid flashback.
c26313 +++$+++ John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
c26313 +++$+++ Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
c26313 +++$+++ Someone will find me.
c26313 +++$+++ Yeah, they'll find you.  Dried up and twice dead.
c26313 +++$+++ You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
c26313 +++$+++ At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
c26313 +++$+++ For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
c26313 +++$+++ Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?
c25151 +++$+++ How did you get the fucking number?
c25151 +++$+++ I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
c25151 +++$+++ I don't do that.
c25151 +++$+++ You do it on the inside....
c25151 +++$+++ Don't tell me what I --
c25151 +++$+++ ...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
c25151 +++$+++ Yes!
c01335 +++$+++ It's enough isn't it?
c01335 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c01335 +++$+++ You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
c01335 +++$+++ Do you want to stop?
c01335 +++$+++ We'll stop then.
c25484 +++$+++ You should always look to the back too, kid.
c25484 +++$+++ I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
c25484 +++$+++ Get on with it then.
c25484 +++$+++ Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
c25484 +++$+++ You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
c25484 +++$+++ This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
c25484 +++$+++ I am after this race.
c26723 +++$+++ Hello.
c26723 +++$+++ Hey. It's me.
c26723 +++$+++ Where are you?
c26723 +++$+++ We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
c26723 +++$+++ How late?
c26723 +++$+++ No. Just like an hour or so.
c26723 +++$+++ What about the chairs?
c26723 +++$+++ Okay.
c26723 +++$+++ What okay?
c26723 +++$+++ What!
c26723 +++$+++ The chairs.
c26723 +++$+++ I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
c26723 +++$+++ No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
c18992 +++$+++ There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
c18992 +++$+++ Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
c18992 +++$+++ Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
c18992 +++$+++ My, we are a hot shot aren't we?
c23160 +++$+++ -- where'd you go?
c23160 +++$+++ -- oh I thought you were --
c23160 +++$+++ Nothing.
c06557 +++$+++ --big as life--sparkling away there under the sun. I--I started walking toward it--and there was a bus outside-- and--well--I--I just naturally got aboard--
c06557 +++$+++ Most natural thing in the world!
c06557 +++$+++ Well--he's got nothing on me.
c08968 +++$+++ Genesis, what's that?
c08968 +++$+++ Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
c08968 +++$+++ I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
c18611 +++$+++ What's the big deal?  A shark got Overman, and we got the shark.
c18611 +++$+++ That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
c18611 +++$+++ What do you mean, we don't?
c18611 +++$+++ Thirty feet???
c21723 +++$+++ Nice car.  Yours?
c21723 +++$+++ No.
c21723 +++$+++ Not exactly.
c05126 +++$+++ Christine what?
c05126 +++$+++ Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
c05126 +++$+++ You picked her up on the ferry.
c05126 +++$+++ I didn't know her.
c05126 +++$+++ And nobody else saw her in the water?
c05126 +++$+++ Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
c05126 +++$+++ Think she might've run out on you?
c05126 +++$+++ Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
c05126 +++$+++ You from around here?
c05126 +++$+++ No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
c05126 +++$+++ You here for the summer?
c05126 +++$+++ Some friends and me took a house.
c05126 +++$+++ What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
c05126 +++$+++ Pretty stiff.
c01944 +++$+++ I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
c01944 +++$+++ If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
c01944 +++$+++ But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
c26487 +++$+++ We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
c26487 +++$+++ Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
c26487 +++$+++ We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
c08334 +++$+++ Hi, John.
c08334 +++$+++ Where are the tapes, Graham?
c08334 +++$+++ What tapes?
c08334 +++$+++ You know which tapes! Where are they?
c08334 +++$+++ John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
c08334 +++$+++ So is my wife, asshole!!
c08334 +++$+++ She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
c08334 +++$+++ What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
c08334 +++$+++ God, you need help.
c08334 +++$+++ I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
c08334 +++$+++ No.
c08334 +++$+++ No.
c22181 +++$+++ Don't you care what the people will say?
c22181 +++$+++ ...I'm doin' it for a friend.
c22181 +++$+++ Whatta you get outta this?
c22181 +++$+++ ...Shrewd.
c23568 +++$+++ Just a moment, miss -  May I?
c23568 +++$+++ Help yourself.
c23568 +++$+++ I am Cinderella the Second.
c19077 +++$+++ With crocodiles... everything's even.
c19077 +++$+++ I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
c19077 +++$+++ Oh, bullshit.
c11391 +++$+++ That for us?
c11391 +++$+++ What a nose.  You missed your calling.
c11391 +++$+++ Can I open it?
c11391 +++$+++ Please?
c16975 +++$+++ Now tell me the truth.
c16975 +++$+++ The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
c16975 +++$+++ And you didn't know her last name?
c16975 +++$+++ Well, it's Carter. That's my name,  And her father was my brother. And he was murdered last Sunday. Now get up and get dressed.
c04993 +++$+++ You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
c04993 +++$+++ Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
c04993 +++$+++ Hell, yes, they know each other. He bonded her out of county.
c04993 +++$+++ How am I supposed to know that?
c04993 +++$+++ You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
c04993 +++$+++ Man, I don't want to hear your fuckin' excuses!
c21145 +++$+++ You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
c21145 +++$+++ Giovanni.
c21145 +++$+++ That's exactly what you are.
c13989 +++$+++ If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
c13989 +++$+++ Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
c13989 +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
c19324 +++$+++ Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
c19324 +++$+++ They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
c19324 +++$+++ Yeah.
c19324 +++$+++ You'd do a good job.
c19324 +++$+++ How 'bout you?
c19324 +++$+++ Don't know if I'll still want it.
c19324 +++$+++ I appreciate you telling me.
c14166 +++$+++ Hello Lucy, had a busy night? Puts money in machine.
c14166 +++$+++ We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
c14166 +++$+++ Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
c14166 +++$+++ There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
c14166 +++$+++ What did you do that for?
c14166 +++$+++ For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
c14166 +++$+++ I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
c14166 +++$+++ Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
c14166 +++$+++ Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
c14166 +++$+++ Doobidoob... a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A long night for growing malchicks... best not to say more. Bedways is rigthways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right.
c04455 +++$+++ You can't go. Call them back.
c04455 +++$+++ Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
c04455 +++$+++ They cancelled it. Why are you acting like this?
c24106 +++$+++ Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother.
c24106 +++$+++ Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
c24106 +++$+++ Right down to the ground.  Let's get to it.
c05394 +++$+++ What news from our friends?
c05394 +++$+++ Barak is still strong in the north, and Tendo holds the high passes. But the great desert forts have fallen.
c05394 +++$+++ Freylag's stronghold?
c05394 +++$+++ It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
c05394 +++$+++ It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
c05394 +++$+++ The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
c05394 +++$+++ We will hold. Their power is not unlimited.
c16310 +++$+++ Better times.
c16310 +++$+++ I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
c16310 +++$+++ Well, I always liked you, Mike.
c16310 +++$+++ I always liked ya so much...
c16310 +++$+++ No - I'm sorry! It's just - I been so lonely - then I saw you, and...
c04355 +++$+++ Hello, Eddie.
c04355 +++$+++ Hi. How's business?
c04355 +++$+++ Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
c04355 +++$+++ Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
c04355 +++$+++ Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
c04355 +++$+++ I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
c04355 +++$+++ What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
c04355 +++$+++ Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
c04355 +++$+++ Man named Turk Baker?
c04355 +++$+++ You know everybody, don't you?
c04355 +++$+++ Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
c04355 +++$+++ Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
c04355 +++$+++ Sign up.
c04355 +++$+++ Where do I sign?
c04355 +++$+++ The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
c04355 +++$+++ You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
c04355 +++$+++ What happened to you anyway?
c04355 +++$+++ Like I told ya. My thumbs.
c04355 +++$+++ No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
c04355 +++$+++ I been thinking.
c04355 +++$+++ Thinking about what?
c04355 +++$+++ Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
c20327 +++$+++ Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
c20327 +++$+++ NI!
c20327 +++$+++ Oh!
c20327 +++$+++ NI!   NI!
c20327 +++$+++ Oh!
c20327 +++$+++ We shall say Ni! again to you if you do not appease us.
c20327 +++$+++ All right!  What do you want?
c20327 +++$+++ We want ... a shrubbery!
c20327 +++$+++ Ni!  Ni!  Ni ... Peng ... Nee ... Wum!
c25320 +++$+++ What's the date?
c25320 +++$+++ The nineteenth... How come you didn't know?
c25320 +++$+++ I've been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
c25320 +++$+++ Er... Yes...
c25320 +++$+++ He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didn't... It hurt him. They used to be close...  Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... "Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another," Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
c08243 +++$+++ Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
c08243 +++$+++ Good-bye.
c08243 +++$+++ I won't get lonely.
c02372 +++$+++ ...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
c02372 +++$+++ Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
c02372 +++$+++ Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
c02372 +++$+++ Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
c13489 +++$+++ Who's this guy? Who's this guy?
c13489 +++$+++ Oh, he ain't nobody.
c13489 +++$+++ You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
c13489 +++$+++ Angelo and Buster.
c13489 +++$+++ Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.
c13489 +++$+++ They'll do it.
c13489 +++$+++ And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
c13489 +++$+++ Yeah.
c13489 +++$+++ And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
c13489 +++$+++ Did I say to do anything yet? I said I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I want to think about it. Where're these pricks at?
c18235 +++$+++ The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
c18235 +++$+++ What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
c18235 +++$+++ Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
c01432 +++$+++ "Goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  To the killer.  Jerry Lee Lewis.
c01432 +++$+++ Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
c01432 +++$+++ That's what you said in the last three piss pots.
c16730 +++$+++ I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.
c16730 +++$+++ John, he's got my driver's license.
c16730 +++$+++ What?
c16730 +++$+++ He took my driver's license, John, he knows where we live.
c16730 +++$+++ He took your wallet?
c16730 +++$+++ No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
c16730 +++$+++ He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
c16730 +++$+++ In my pocket.
c16730 +++$+++ We got him!  Dad you got him!
c16730 +++$+++ What?
c16730 +++$+++ His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
c16730 +++$+++ How the hell am I gonna do that?
c16730 +++$+++ Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
c16730 +++$+++ What...
c16730 +++$+++ Okay, okay...
c25809 +++$+++ What happened to you?
c25809 +++$+++ You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
c25809 +++$+++ What for?
c25809 +++$+++ Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
c00506 +++$+++ I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
c00506 +++$+++ I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
c00506 +++$+++ Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
c00506 +++$+++ ...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
c00506 +++$+++ We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
c00506 +++$+++ The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
c10784 +++$+++ You mean the time you're locked away?
c10784 +++$+++ No. Prison is time. That's it. You think time, you feel time, you hear time. Your heart doesn't beat to live, it just beats... time.
c10784 +++$+++ Don't be sorry for me. I did those things. No one else did. I'm dealing with that.
c11432 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c11432 +++$+++ There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
c11432 +++$+++ I'm so sorry.
c11432 +++$+++ You fucking cow, can't you read?!
c11432 +++$+++ How long ago was it?
c07952 +++$+++ This is the edge, boy.  This is the end.
c07952 +++$+++ Yeah.
c07952 +++$+++ I like you, you know?
c07952 +++$+++ We got to do something.  Don't we?
c19332 +++$+++ Yeah?
c19332 +++$+++ You haven't paid the cab.  He won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
c19332 +++$+++ How much?
c19332 +++$+++ Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
c26448 +++$+++ Yeah?
c26448 +++$+++ Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
c26448 +++$+++ ...They been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up Delilah.
c17249 +++$+++ Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
c17249 +++$+++ How you doing, man?
c17249 +++$+++ You know where the others are?
c10053 +++$+++ So... I see you made the news.
c10053 +++$+++ It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
c10053 +++$+++ Uh-huh. Where was he?
c10053 +++$+++ Yeah, that's more or less what the others said, too. Out getting coffee... supposed to meet him here... picking up my grandma...
c19525 +++$+++ Guess he talked to you.
c19525 +++$+++ Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
c19525 +++$+++ Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
c11408 +++$+++ Don't be so sure.
c11408 +++$+++ Listen to yourself...  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
c11408 +++$+++ She left the fucking gate open.
c11408 +++$+++ Well he can't have gone far.
c11408 +++$+++ Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
c11408 +++$+++ He'll find his way back.
c11408 +++$+++ Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
c15331 +++$+++ Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
c15331 +++$+++ Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
c15331 +++$+++ But was it a bad decision?  At the time, I thought her money would save the movie.
c15331 +++$+++ Yeah, I did.
c14263 +++$+++ Love gives you wings.  It makes you fly.  I don't even call it love.  I call it Geronimo.
c14263 +++$+++ Geronimo?
c14263 +++$+++ Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
c14263 +++$+++ Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
c11485 +++$+++ You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
c11485 +++$+++ One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
c11485 +++$+++ What did I tell you?
c11485 +++$+++ You wash 'em, you break 'em. I'll come back for them later.  If he makes trouble, give me a yell.
c21146 +++$+++ Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
c21146 +++$+++ You miss me?...
c21146 +++$+++ Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
c21146 +++$+++ Well, there's nothing here to eat.
c23746 +++$+++ I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
c23746 +++$+++ That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
c23746 +++$+++ Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
c23746 +++$+++ I know but we're in a bind.
c01812 +++$+++ ...but you're not -- you're not sure...
c01812 +++$+++ We can't wait to be sure.
c01812 +++$+++ I don't want to move again... I like it here.
c01812 +++$+++ Look, we clear out, we get to the shack, we get safe. We hang there awhile. I'll come back. I'll check it out. But right now we can't --
c01812 +++$+++ -- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
c07957 +++$+++ You thought I was Mom?
c07957 +++$+++ Yeah!
c07957 +++$+++ It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
c07957 +++$+++ And you dropped it?
c07957 +++$+++ Yeah!  Shh!
c07957 +++$+++ I better clean this up before she sees it.
c20168 +++$+++ I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
c20168 +++$+++ Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
c20168 +++$+++ Yes.
c20168 +++$+++ Yes, he is.
c16450 +++$+++ You think they'll find any?
c16450 +++$+++ POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
c16450 +++$+++ The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
c03161 +++$+++ That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
c03161 +++$+++ If money can buy what he wants.
c03161 +++$+++ Then you're a lucky man.
c19614 +++$+++ Was it a call back?
c19614 +++$+++ No.  But I probably will get a call back.
c19614 +++$+++ If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
c19614 +++$+++ Saucy-saucy.
c21182 +++$+++ Terry-- what's happening to you?
c21182 +++$+++ I just told the Father.
c21182 +++$+++ Told him what?
c21182 +++$+++ What I did to Joey.
c21182 +++$+++ You... .
c21182 +++$+++ What I did to Joey.
c21182 +++$+++ Edie-- it's--
c02346 +++$+++ Have you got a license?
c02346 +++$+++ No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
c02346 +++$+++ What kind of a dog is he?
c02346 +++$+++ He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
c02346 +++$+++ Well - what is he now?
c02346 +++$+++ He's half poodle and half watch dog -
c02346 +++$+++ Half watch dog?
c02346 +++$+++ Yeh, he's only got one eye.
c02346 +++$+++ I don't know much about dogs but you ought to be on the end of a leash - a ninety-nine year leash -  Look - what do you call your dog?
c02346 +++$+++ I don't call him, I whistle.
c02346 +++$+++ What do you whistle?
c02346 +++$+++ Yankee Poodle.
c02346 +++$+++ I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?
c02346 +++$+++ I don't want him.
c02346 +++$+++ Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
c02346 +++$+++ I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.
c10516 +++$+++ Why didn't you drop any sail?
c10516 +++$+++ Skipper called us out of the rigging.
c10516 +++$+++ But your instinct was to lose sail?
c10516 +++$+++ My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
c10516 +++$+++ How old are you, son?
c10516 +++$+++ Thank you.
c26998 +++$+++ I tried to break it off!
c26998 +++$+++ You should have tried harder.
c26998 +++$+++ Get out of my way.
c21020 +++$+++ What did she say?
c21020 +++$+++ Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
c21020 +++$+++ Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
c24463 +++$+++ Gus?
c24463 +++$+++ Say what?
c24463 +++$+++ Say who?
c26529 +++$+++ I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
c26529 +++$+++ Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
c26529 +++$+++ You're joking.
c26529 +++$+++ Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
c26529 +++$+++ Counselor, you're bluffing. Shall I push for misdemeanor two?
c17721 +++$+++ I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
c17721 +++$+++ Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
c17721 +++$+++ How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
c17721 +++$+++ Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?  Jesus!
c04403 +++$+++ Where's Bert?
c04403 +++$+++ He went off someplace.
c04403 +++$+++ Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
c04403 +++$+++ Just for luck.
c18075 +++$+++ How did you get this number?
c18075 +++$+++ Mr. Jones is dead.  So are two of his men.  The other three are in jail.  I have the disks.  I have Walter Smith. And you know what, you motherfucker?  I have you.
c18075 +++$+++ I also have a couple of million in cash. Call Sonny Benza.  Ask if I can keep it.
c17463 +++$+++ Hello...?
c17463 +++$+++ This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
c17463 +++$+++ Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
c06101 +++$+++ You're a damn liar.
c06101 +++$+++ You _took_ me, you bastard, and now I'm taking you.
c06101 +++$+++ It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
c06101 +++$+++ You know it.
c06101 +++$+++ I'll give you back the 600.
c06101 +++$+++ I don't want your money.
c06101 +++$+++ There's two guns on you.
c10924 +++$+++ Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.
c10924 +++$+++ Y'what?
c10924 +++$+++ You heard, it gets on my wick.
c10924 +++$+++ Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
c10924 +++$+++ I'm a deserter.
c10924 +++$+++ Are you now?
c10924 +++$+++ Yeah, I've blown school out.
c10924 +++$+++ Just you?
c10924 +++$+++ No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
c10924 +++$+++ Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
c10924 +++$+++ Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
c10924 +++$+++ Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
c10924 +++$+++ Yeah.
c10924 +++$+++ Not much cop without 'em, is it?
c10924 +++$+++ Oh, it's all right.
c10924 +++$+++ Yeah?
c10924 +++$+++ What they like?
c18798 +++$+++ What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
c18798 +++$+++ Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
c18798 +++$+++ I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
c14873 +++$+++ Oh... Hi.
c14873 +++$+++ Dirty business we're in sometimes.
c14873 +++$+++ He's not gonna win -- not in the end... They never do.
c06819 +++$+++ Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
c06819 +++$+++ Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
c06819 +++$+++ Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
c06819 +++$+++ Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
c06819 +++$+++ May I offer you a drink?
c06819 +++$+++ Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
c06819 +++$+++ Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
c06819 +++$+++ Yes, of course.  Hortense, darling, will you tell Louise to bring some sherry?
c19307 +++$+++ Morning, Sheriff.
c19307 +++$+++ Hey, Pete. How's it going?
c19307 +++$+++ Time marches on.
c19307 +++$+++ How much you got left?
c19307 +++$+++ Three months.
c19307 +++$+++ You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
c19307 +++$+++ It was for personal consumption.
c19307 +++$+++ I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
c00283 +++$+++ What can I do for you, Mr. Welles?
c00283 +++$+++ Call me Tom.
c00283 +++$+++ Alright, Tom.
c00283 +++$+++ What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
c00283 +++$+++ Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
c07551 +++$+++ Mrs. Argon?  It's Sim.
c07551 +++$+++ Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
c07551 +++$+++ Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
c07551 +++$+++ We lost him.
c16397 +++$+++ Can't you call it off... ?
c16397 +++$+++ It's out of our hands.  This is it.
c16397 +++$+++ Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
c20819 +++$+++ That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.
c20819 +++$+++ She don't look no worse to me.
c20819 +++$+++ Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
c20819 +++$+++ Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
c20819 +++$+++ What did you say, boy?!
c20819 +++$+++ I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
c23768 +++$+++ Hello?
c23768 +++$+++ Hello, mom?
c23768 +++$+++ Theodore? Where are you? Are you alright?
c23768 +++$+++ I found dad.
c23768 +++$+++ He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
c23768 +++$+++ Mom, you know I had to do it. I just did it a little too late.
c23768 +++$+++ I gotta go. Love ya mom.
c14486 +++$+++ He asked me to marry him.
c14486 +++$+++ Very romantic setting.
c14486 +++$+++ So are you engaged, or what?
c15277 +++$+++ MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
c15277 +++$+++ I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
c15277 +++$+++ Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
c15277 +++$+++ Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
c15277 +++$+++ No.
c04820 +++$+++ You send telegrams here?
c04820 +++$+++ I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is--"  No, do you really?
c04820 +++$+++ Go on. Go on send the telegram.
c04820 +++$+++ "How would you like to have the story, you big tub of--of--"
c04820 +++$+++ Mush. Mush.
c04820 +++$+++ "Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
c04820 +++$+++ Send it collect.
c04820 +++$+++ Collect.
c23255 +++$+++ Mrs. Torrance, your husband introduced you as Winifred.  Now are you a Winnie or a Freddie?
c23255 +++$+++ I'm a Wendy.
c23255 +++$+++ Oh Wendy.  That's nice.  That's the prettiest.
c23255 +++$+++ Yeah, this is it.  How do you like it, Danny?  Is it big enough for you?
c23268 +++$+++ Only in a very general way.
c23268 +++$+++ Well...
c23268 +++$+++ Well, that sounds fine to me.
c04081 +++$+++ Byzantine?
c04081 +++$+++ Basil the II.
c04081 +++$+++ -All but one out of a hundred, I know.  All left to be led like donkeys back home.  Now if you will please-
c06828 +++$+++ How did you know it was Captain Charles?
c06828 +++$+++ I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
c06828 +++$+++ Yes, of course.  What do you want?
c21860 +++$+++ Maybe it's not true!
c21860 +++$+++ No way out.  No way out.
c21860 +++$+++ Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
c21860 +++$+++ No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
c21860 +++$+++ The majority.  The majority.  Yes. Let's hear from the majority.
c13509 +++$+++ Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
c13509 +++$+++ It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
c13509 +++$+++ A superhero's job is to protect society.  Don't blame me if society is a horrible, corrupt joke.
c13509 +++$+++ "A superhero's job is to protect.." Sorry, I can't take you seriously...I overheard you say that tomorrow the Cult of Good will be dead--I should be so lucky--what did that mean?
c13509 +++$+++ My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
c13509 +++$+++ Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
c13509 +++$+++ Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
c13509 +++$+++ I still have one left...
c13509 +++$+++ You've seen me...
c12829 +++$+++ Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
c12829 +++$+++ Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
c12829 +++$+++ You better.  Please answer the question.
c26490 +++$+++ Jack. What are you doing here?
c26490 +++$+++ I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
c26490 +++$+++ You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
c07528 +++$+++ I'm a scientist.  I have lived my whole life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I'd give it to him.
c07528 +++$+++ You mean the designs for the nanobot?  You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
c07528 +++$+++ Make me?  How?  You think he's going to torture me?
c27071 +++$+++ Ted, have you lost your mind?
c27071 +++$+++ You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
c27071 +++$+++ I don't LIKE you. We're JUST FRIENDS.
c27071 +++$+++ But that smile.
c27071 +++$+++ So you'll think about it?
c17641 +++$+++ What do we do?
c17641 +++$+++ He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
c17641 +++$+++ I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
c17641 +++$+++ I'll check back in an hour.
c02269 +++$+++ Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
c02269 +++$+++ Why not just buy your baby a night light?
c02269 +++$+++ That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
c02269 +++$+++ Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
c08562 +++$+++ Okay, Dad.
c08562 +++$+++ If anyone asks about Simone --
c08562 +++$+++ -- I know, I don't know anything.
c08562 +++$+++ I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
c22707 +++$+++ Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
c22707 +++$+++ Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
c22707 +++$+++ You like it?
c22707 +++$+++ Oh yeah!
c22707 +++$+++ I didn't think anyone would get it.
c22707 +++$+++ Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful.   It's... no, don't worry about it.  You're very funny.  Go back, that's great!
c22707 +++$+++ Okay.
c06949 +++$+++ Hello Nancy.
c06949 +++$+++ Hi daddy. I know what happened.
c06949 +++$+++ You know he's dead though, right?
c23977 +++$+++ This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
c23977 +++$+++ What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
c23977 +++$+++ Yes.
c04065 +++$+++ Which way are you going?
c04065 +++$+++ That way.  You?
c04065 +++$+++ That way.
c04065 +++$+++ And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
c04065 +++$+++ Right.
c23777 +++$+++ Think of this business like a big aquarium. You gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top.
c23777 +++$+++ Profits down there, philanthropy up here.  Besides, it beats the pants off bingo.
c23777 +++$+++ Nice set-up.
c23777 +++$+++ If it springs a leak, it'll be because Buzz is making waves.
c23777 +++$+++ He's earned an early retirement.  But enough about losers; Buzz Fazeli is history. Lets talk about your future.  I wanna show you something.
c05288 +++$+++ No.
c05288 +++$+++ I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
c05288 +++$+++ Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
c20537 +++$+++ And she saved it.
c20537 +++$+++ Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
c20537 +++$+++ I've got something better.
c10603 +++$+++ Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
c10603 +++$+++ Gotta hex from a voodoo?
c10603 +++$+++ You do.
c08102 +++$+++ Follow you where?
c08102 +++$+++ Down to my car.
c08102 +++$+++ It's a surprise.
c20215 +++$+++ You have Bellerophon.
c20215 +++$+++ Do I?
c20215 +++$+++ You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
c20215 +++$+++ 'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
c20215 +++$+++ Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
c20215 +++$+++ By asking me.
c20215 +++$+++ You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
c20215 +++$+++ You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
c20215 +++$+++ You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
c24658 +++$+++ Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
c24658 +++$+++ What sort of thing?
c24658 +++$+++ Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
c13716 +++$+++ And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
c13716 +++$+++ Then who does?
c13716 +++$+++ I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
c13716 +++$+++ Or you --  Or you --
c19784 +++$+++ Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
c19784 +++$+++ It is apparently not working.
c19784 +++$+++ Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
c07505 +++$+++ I knew him.  Probably one of the few he knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.
c07505 +++$+++ 'Bootstrap?'
c07505 +++$+++ Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
c07505 +++$+++ That's not true.
c07505 +++$+++ I swear, you look just like him.
c07505 +++$+++ It's not true my father was a pirate.
c07505 +++$+++ Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
c07505 +++$+++ He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
c07505 +++$+++ You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable life. And they're all 'merchant marines.'
c07505 +++$+++ My father did not think of my mother -- his family -- as a burden.
c07505 +++$+++ My father -- was not -- a pirate!
c11246 +++$+++ Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
c11246 +++$+++ Or else what? You'll kill me?
c11246 +++$+++ You'll never get the chance.
c11855 +++$+++ What are you thinking?
c11855 +++$+++ That I want you to take me home.
c11855 +++$+++ I don't want to come here anymore.
c26280 +++$+++ What you want?
c26280 +++$+++ Open up!
c26280 +++$+++ We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
c26280 +++$+++ Come back when the sun comes up.
c14710 +++$+++ Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
c14710 +++$+++ Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
c14710 +++$+++ All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
c23926 +++$+++ 35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
c23926 +++$+++ Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
c23926 +++$+++ Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
c23926 +++$+++ Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
c23926 +++$+++ Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
c23926 +++$+++ I don't want everyone to see.
c23926 +++$+++ Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
c23926 +++$+++ It's all I think about anymore.
c15643 +++$+++ It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
c15643 +++$+++ Bobby--
c15643 +++$+++ It's been a few years.
c15643 +++$+++ Yeah.
c15643 +++$+++ I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
c15643 +++$+++ I need help.
c15643 +++$+++ Tell me about it.
c15643 +++$+++ How can I reach you?
c15643 +++$+++ Are you okay?
c15643 +++$+++ Yeah, what's going on?
c16888 +++$+++ Call German.
c16888 +++$+++ Any particular reason?
c16888 +++$+++ We can't stay here.
c16888 +++$+++ They think I offed the Director.
c11325 +++$+++ What's- It's me, open up.
c11325 +++$+++ Oh.
c11325 +++$+++ Are you okay?  What's the matter?  Are you all right? What-
c11325 +++$+++ There's a spider in the bathroom.
c11325 +++$+++ What?
c11325 +++$+++ There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
c11325 +++$+++ That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
c11325 +++$+++ My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
c11325 +++$+++ Oooh.
c11325 +++$+++ I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
c11325 +++$+++ No.
c24985 +++$+++ The creator of what?
c24985 +++$+++ A show - that gives hope and joy and inspiration to millions.
c24985 +++$+++ You're the star.
c22976 +++$+++ Why it's just a snip of calico...
c22976 +++$+++ You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
c22976 +++$+++ No...not yet...
c19509 +++$+++ It just isn't.
c19509 +++$+++ Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
c19509 +++$+++ You had a rough couple years, that's all.
c19509 +++$+++ That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
c19509 +++$+++ And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
c19509 +++$+++ Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
c19509 +++$+++ You're serious.
c19509 +++$+++ Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
c19509 +++$+++ Like what?
c19509 +++$+++ Wow.
c22847 +++$+++ Ha. Maybe I should join SNL.
c22847 +++$+++ Need to get in that building?
c22847 +++$+++ No really?
c22847 +++$+++ There a story in that building?
c22847 +++$+++ Gale Weathers would find a way.
c06968 +++$+++ Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
c06968 +++$+++ Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
c06968 +++$+++ And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
c06968 +++$+++ Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
c09912 +++$+++ This is magnificent...
c09912 +++$+++ Thank you.
c09912 +++$+++ Yes.
c10864 +++$+++ How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
c10864 +++$+++ A mistake...
c10864 +++$+++ Agnes, how did your mother get you?
c10864 +++$+++ A mistake... it was a mistake...
c10864 +++$+++ Is that what she said?
c10864 +++$+++ If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint...
c10864 +++$+++ Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
c10864 +++$+++ I can't help it if I'm stupid.
c10864 +++$+++ ... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
c10864 +++$+++ Not my fault.
c10864 +++$+++ ... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
c10864 +++$+++ I was a mistake.
c10864 +++$+++ What the child?
c10864 +++$+++ Agnes...
c03231 +++$+++ I think one of us should fuck Josh...
c03231 +++$+++ Go ahead...
c03231 +++$+++ No, really...
c03231 +++$+++ God, you're really obsessed...
c03231 +++$+++ I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
c03231 +++$+++ I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
c03231 +++$+++ No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
c07824 +++$+++ So, we've got to come up with our movie. Our biography.
c07824 +++$+++ Right-
c07824 +++$+++ We find the man and then we dissect him-
c07824 +++$+++ Like a bug.
c07824 +++$+++ Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
c22578 +++$+++ Well?
c22578 +++$+++ I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
c22578 +++$+++ You haven't tried locking them up!
c22578 +++$+++ No, just the ring leaders. The fire-eaters. And the ones with big families ...  Barton -- where's that boy?
c02071 +++$+++ Honest mistake. Just give me the money back and all will be forgiven.
c02071 +++$+++ I can't do that.
c02071 +++$+++ Why not?
c02071 +++$+++ Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
c02071 +++$+++ Let me repeat -- Why not?
c02071 +++$+++ Because you killed one of my crew.
c02071 +++$+++ Buddy, that was business. Besides, you have more crew. Then there's you...
c02071 +++$+++ I'll get the money back, plus interest. I go on the grift for you. You get a cat, I get a cut. And we get square.
c02071 +++$+++ No. Just confidence.
c13976 +++$+++ I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
c13976 +++$+++ One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
c13976 +++$+++ All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
c23591 +++$+++ The most wonderful thing happened -
c23591 +++$+++ What?
c23591 +++$+++ They repealed Prohibition?
c09911 +++$+++ Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
c09911 +++$+++ Then you came to a desert and mountains...
c09911 +++$+++ Yes.
c09911 +++$+++ And you saw a shape ahead of you...
c09911 +++$+++ Yes!
c09911 +++$+++ We all have that dream.
c09911 +++$+++ All of you?
c09911 +++$+++ Every night.
c09911 +++$+++ We share everything.
c06435 +++$+++ Their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in Sicily.
c06435 +++$+++ Precisely. We are the true entrepreneurs, and Prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. America is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of Little Italy.
c06435 +++$+++ We'll start small. When we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. Only sell the best stuff. And keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
c06435 +++$+++ Don't worry. I got friends to take care of that.
c07499 +++$+++ I don't like the situation, Mister Sparrow.  The island is riddled with caves.  I will not put my men at a disadvantage.
c07499 +++$+++ Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
c07499 +++$+++ You would do that?
c07499 +++$+++ They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
c07499 +++$+++ I knew you'd listen to reason!
c08332 +++$+++ I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
c08332 +++$+++ You were prying before?
c08332 +++$+++ Yes, this afternoon. I was grilling Ann about your marriage this afternoon.
c08332 +++$+++ She held up very well.
c11858 +++$+++ Did you give him a gift?
c11858 +++$+++ No.
c11858 +++$+++ I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
c11858 +++$+++ It was a play.
c11858 +++$+++ I have expectations, too.
c26521 +++$+++ Then what?
c26521 +++$+++ McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
c26521 +++$+++ Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
c15859 +++$+++ Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
c15859 +++$+++ I take it back.
c15859 +++$+++ Good.
c19556 +++$+++ ....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
c19556 +++$+++ What?
c19556 +++$+++ I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
c16389 +++$+++ There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!
c16389 +++$+++ This isn't possible...
c16389 +++$+++ We're going to have to do something about Marla...
c16389 +++$+++ It's okay.  We okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
c00296 +++$+++ You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
c00296 +++$+++ Shut up.
c00296 +++$+++ Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
c00296 +++$+++ Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
c14876 +++$+++ So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
c14876 +++$+++ Yeah.
c14876 +++$+++ Of course.
c27165 +++$+++ What?  You're going to drive off without even saying hi?
c27165 +++$+++ Hi, Sandy.
c27165 +++$+++ Can't.  Got a passenger.
c19030 +++$+++ I do, now.
c19030 +++$+++ And you have horses? You love horses.
c19030 +++$+++ I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
c19030 +++$+++ Will you buy the sheep for me?
c19030 +++$+++ Where will you keep them?
c19030 +++$+++ Here. We'll collect them.
c19030 +++$+++ I will buy them for you.
c19030 +++$+++ Hmmm.
c21501 +++$+++ Why did I fall on you?
c21501 +++$+++ He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
c21501 +++$+++ I mean, I mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I mean, I mean, why did I fall <u>at all</u>?
c21501 +++$+++ Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
c17413 +++$+++ Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
c17413 +++$+++ I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
c17413 +++$+++ Shore it is. It always is, this time a year.
c06365 +++$+++ Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.
c06365 +++$+++ You living together?
c06365 +++$+++ She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
c06365 +++$+++ Explain how that works.
c06365 +++$+++ She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
c06365 +++$+++ She grow up in Livingtston, too?
c06365 +++$+++ No, no, no...  She's from Hoboken.
c06365 +++$+++ Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?
c06365 +++$+++ Every couple of months, huh?
c06904 +++$+++ You killed two men, Ben Harper.
c06904 +++$+++ That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
c06904 +++$+++ Would you have free candy for the kids, Preacher?
c23140 +++$+++ I'd like to do your hair sometime.
c23140 +++$+++ Why?
c23140 +++$+++ ... just, you could look very heavy...
c23140 +++$+++ Don't make conversation with me.
c23140 +++$+++ You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
c09987 +++$+++ I am funny.  I'm real funny.
c09987 +++$+++ Are you in town?  This sounds long distance.
c09987 +++$+++ Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
c07685 +++$+++ Well don't you?
c07685 +++$+++ I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
c07685 +++$+++ Really?
c07685 +++$+++ Oh. Okay. I'll try that then.
c17906 +++$+++ Hello I'm Dr...
c17906 +++$+++ Ambrose. I know.
c17906 +++$+++ Have we met?
c17906 +++$+++ Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
c26803 +++$+++ NY Times, Washington Post, War, War, War.  Times got the girlscout page twelve, Post in Section Two.... Horses in Mid-Stream...?
c26803 +++$+++ I don't think you're gonna need it.
c26803 +++$+++ Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
c26803 +++$+++ They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
c26803 +++$+++ What can it hurt is they offend me.
c01783 +++$+++ Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
c01783 +++$+++ No. I just have short hair.
c01783 +++$+++ Is that your chiquita?
c01783 +++$+++ She Chicano, yes?
c20806 +++$+++ How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
c20806 +++$+++ Huh?
c20806 +++$+++ Don't look so scared.
c20806 +++$+++ Well, I haven't come around.
c08220 +++$+++ The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
c08220 +++$+++ You can?
c08220 +++$+++ I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
c26862 +++$+++ Public Domain.
c26862 +++$+++ And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
c26862 +++$+++ We-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>.
c26862 +++$+++ No problem.  Here's the...
c15231 +++$+++ And I really wanted some ice cream too.
c15231 +++$+++ I can run out and get it.
c15231 +++$+++ No!  No!  You won't come back either.
c15231 +++$+++ I can't be staying long anyway.
c15231 +++$+++ How long then?
c15231 +++$+++ Long enough for us to do the nasty.
c15231 +++$+++ That's out.  No!  It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
c15231 +++$+++ A quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
c15231 +++$+++ You a blue-moon fool.
c15231 +++$+++ Then we'll do something else.
c15231 +++$+++ What else?
c15231 +++$+++ Trust me.
c15231 +++$+++ Trust me.
c08244 +++$+++ At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
c08244 +++$+++ Yes.
c08244 +++$+++ And you knew he'd be here.
c08244 +++$+++ I want you to look for Jacqueline.
c00068 +++$+++ My letters of appointment.
c00068 +++$+++ Appointment to what?
c00068 +++$+++ Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
c09528 +++$+++ Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
c09528 +++$+++ You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
c09528 +++$+++ No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
c09528 +++$+++ Beating you away.
c07437 +++$+++ The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
c07437 +++$+++ The middle colonies?
c07437 +++$+++ Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
c07437 +++$+++ Poor Richard says they'll make a Declaration of Independence by July.
c24035 +++$+++ ...little woman has gone crazy about our dinner party...City Council...?  What's the trouble...?
c24035 +++$+++ Main Street.
c24035 +++$+++ <u>Fuck</u> the traffic light.  I'm talking about three percent of the adjusted gross of a Major Motion Picture...
c19764 +++$+++ So how can I help you...?
c19764 +++$+++ I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
c19764 +++$+++ No clubs.  I wanna reach the TOP!  Carnegie Hall...!
c15819 +++$+++ So that stuff -- it kills people.
c15819 +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
c15819 +++$+++ Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
c15819 +++$+++ Have you been to the water board?
c15819 +++$+++ Hunh-uh.  What's that?
c15819 +++$+++ Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
c15819 +++$+++ Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
c02700 +++$+++ I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. I think I'm getting The Fear.
c02700 +++$+++ Nonsense. We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve.
c02700 +++$+++ That's what gives me The Fear.
c02700 +++$+++ Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
c02700 +++$+++ Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
c02700 +++$+++ Not much. Why?
c02700 +++$+++ I have to go.
c02700 +++$+++ GO?
c02700 +++$+++ Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
c02700 +++$+++ Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
c02700 +++$+++ No. This is serious. One more hour in this town and I'll kill somebody!
c02700 +++$+++ OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
c02700 +++$+++ Can we make it?
c02700 +++$+++ That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
c02700 +++$+++ I want to leave fast.
c02700 +++$+++ Do they pay you to screw that bear?
c08396 +++$+++ It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
c08396 +++$+++ I'd rather have a knife.
c08396 +++$+++ I'm working on it.
c02756 +++$+++ I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
c02756 +++$+++ Thanks, Dad.
c02756 +++$+++ An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
c02756 +++$+++ I didn't have much to do with it.
c02756 +++$+++ You wrote it, didn't you?
c02756 +++$+++ Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
c02756 +++$+++ Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
c02756 +++$+++ He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
c02756 +++$+++ Yeah... well... it's possible. Harry York and I both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and... well... There are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. That's the way of things, but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
c02756 +++$+++ Is Kaminski a Communist?
c02756 +++$+++ He's a socialist, then?
c24709 +++$+++ I want you to understand why you're here. You're automatically banned from public life under Control Council Directive No 24. We're here to look into your case before you appear in front of the Tribunal for Artists of the Denazification Commission. You understand that?
c24709 +++$+++ I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
c24709 +++$+++ That is correct.
c25504 +++$+++ Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
c25504 +++$+++ Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
c25504 +++$+++ Disappeared!
c13600 +++$+++ He's back, Col
c13600 +++$+++ Hi.
c13600 +++$+++ Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
c13600 +++$+++ No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
c17192 +++$+++ Did you kill anyone?
c17192 +++$+++ I don't like to talk about that.
c17192 +++$+++ It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
c17192 +++$+++ Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
c17192 +++$+++ Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
c17192 +++$+++ No.  I could have, though.
c17192 +++$+++ Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon?
c17192 +++$+++ Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
c17192 +++$+++ What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
c17192 +++$+++ Can't today.
c17192 +++$+++ I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
c17192 +++$+++ All righty.  I understand.
c27171 +++$+++ Aha!
c27171 +++$+++ Aha?
c27171 +++$+++ Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
c27171 +++$+++ Is this leading somewhere?
c27171 +++$+++ Potentially.  This is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  The cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  Piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
c27171 +++$+++ Starting with a screw?
c27171 +++$+++ What about the explosive?
c20803 +++$+++ What's wrong?
c20803 +++$+++ Smells like something crawled in there and died.
c20803 +++$+++ Come here, baby.
c11290 +++$+++ Uh... you-you wanna lift?
c11290 +++$+++ Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
c11290 +++$+++ No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
c11290 +++$+++ Oh, no, I have a car.
c11290 +++$+++ You have a car?  So...  I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
c11290 +++$+++ I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
c11290 +++$+++ Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
c11290 +++$+++ Me? Oh, downtown!
c11290 +++$+++ Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
c11290 +++$+++ Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
c11290 +++$+++ Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
c12233 +++$+++ And your sushi was remarkable.
c12233 +++$+++ The sushi?  I did the wine. Didn't you do the sushi?
c12233 +++$+++ Who did the sushi?
c21174 +++$+++ Wham... .
c21174 +++$+++ How do you like it?
c21174 +++$+++ It's quite--  -nice.
c21174 +++$+++ How about another one?
c21174 +++$+++ Hit me again, Mac.
c10937 +++$+++ But that's not like a real person at all.
c10937 +++$+++ Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
c10937 +++$+++ They ought to be.
c10937 +++$+++ Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
c10937 +++$+++ What are you?
c10937 +++$+++ I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
c10937 +++$+++ I bet you don't sound like real people.
c10937 +++$+++ We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
c10937 +++$+++ What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
c23882 +++$+++ All the facts you need are right in front of you.
c23882 +++$+++ Gimme a minute here... I think I've got it.
c23882 +++$+++ Do you?
c23882 +++$+++ Save your breath.  It's not an alien spacecraft.
c19064 +++$+++ We'd only just met.
c19064 +++$+++ Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
c19064 +++$+++ Species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. You've got a crocodile.  Bury your friend.
c07129 +++$+++ Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
c07129 +++$+++ Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
c07129 +++$+++ The Republican Party was never home to extremists.  You should know better. This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and McCarthy never did you any good in the long run, now did he?
c21910 +++$+++ That's proof Mary was here!  It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
c21910 +++$+++ Bates never denied Mary was here.
c21910 +++$+++ Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
c21910 +++$+++ Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
c06498 +++$+++ Oh, please, don't hurt me.
c06498 +++$+++ I just need to use the phone, lady.
c06498 +++$+++ Oh, let me get out of your way then.
c06498 +++$+++ Have a nice day.
c12765 +++$+++ Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
c12765 +++$+++ Yes.
c12765 +++$+++ Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
c12765 +++$+++ Like cats and dogs.
c12765 +++$+++ What did they argue about?
c12765 +++$+++ You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
c12765 +++$+++ Did they argue the day before he died?
c12765 +++$+++ Well -- he died on a Sunday and I have the weekends off -- but they were ripping at each other with both barrels Friday afternoon.
c12765 +++$+++ What was the nature of the argument?
c12765 +++$+++ Could you be more specific?
c22921 +++$+++ Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
c22921 +++$+++ I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
c22921 +++$+++ Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
c22921 +++$+++ You know.
c12622 +++$+++ Frank gone?
c12622 +++$+++ Yeah. but get outta here. He's comin' back.
c12622 +++$+++ Bull.
c12622 +++$+++ Alright, suit yourself.
c12622 +++$+++ He's comin' back?. What for?
c12622 +++$+++ 'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
c12622 +++$+++ Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me. and you. and really it's all thanks to Don. isn't it. remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
c12622 +++$+++ Oh he forced you, huh?
c12622 +++$+++ He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
c12622 +++$+++ Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see. I'll get you.
c27163 +++$+++ You mean this thing?
c27163 +++$+++ Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
c27163 +++$+++ I thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  Why didn't you buy a nice big power boat?
c27163 +++$+++ Yeah, or get me drowned.
c07681 +++$+++ Do you have the lettuce?
c07681 +++$+++ ... Yeah.
c07681 +++$+++ Have you cooked the burgers?
c07681 +++$+++ Well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
c06401 +++$+++ System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
c06401 +++$+++ True.
c06401 +++$+++ -- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
c03016 +++$+++ Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
c03016 +++$+++ Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
c03016 +++$+++ Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
c03016 +++$+++ All right. You got it. You win. I'll deliver it now.  Just give me a moment to set it up.
c13805 +++$+++ You break up with me because I won't fuck you.
c13805 +++$+++ That's not why we broke up.
c13805 +++$+++ You flaunt some slut in my face.
c13805 +++$+++ Sharon's far from a slut.
c13805 +++$+++ Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
c23803 +++$+++ Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
c23803 +++$+++ Calm down, Dr. Levine.
c23803 +++$+++ Please, Dr. Levine.
c16528 +++$+++ You think I'm a fake.
c16528 +++$+++ I think it's what you think.
c16528 +++$+++ Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
c01695 +++$+++ You're right.
c01695 +++$+++ Those who do not act are in a constant state of ethical indecision.
c01695 +++$+++ I want to stand for what I believe in, father.
c01695 +++$+++ Then you must find out what your beliefs are.
c01695 +++$+++ I believe these young men are right.
c01695 +++$+++ You know them personally?
c01695 +++$+++ Yes.
c01695 +++$+++ No. They would never do that.
c22725 +++$+++ Nice one.
c22725 +++$+++ Yeah?
c22725 +++$+++ I think you should wear that.
c22725 +++$+++ Mmmm.
c04757 +++$+++ You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
c04757 +++$+++ Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that--
c04757 +++$+++ Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
c04757 +++$+++ Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye.
c04757 +++$+++ Yes, of course.
c12278 +++$+++ Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
c12278 +++$+++ No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
c12278 +++$+++ Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
c12278 +++$+++ It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here -- I feel it a little myself. You're an angel, my dear - thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort.
c22399 +++$+++ What's she doing?
c22399 +++$+++ Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
c22399 +++$+++ I don't want to hear this.
c22399 +++$+++ Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
c22399 +++$+++ She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands.  You better get that ice.
c15976 +++$+++ No.
c15976 +++$+++ I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
c15976 +++$+++ Why?
c13060 +++$+++ This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
c13060 +++$+++ Are you still following me?
c13060 +++$+++ Please, Jill ... I love you.
c13060 +++$+++ Go away.
c13060 +++$+++ There are plenty of other safe places. Why don't we go back to my flat?
c13060 +++$+++ Leave me alone!
c13060 +++$+++ You've got to trust me. It sounds silly but I know we were meant to meet.
c13060 +++$+++ You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
c13060 +++$+++ I vas just trying to help. I decided to trust you. Maybe I was wrong. Whose side are you on really? Who are your friends? Who was the man who gave you the parcel? What's in it? It's the only thing you saved from the lorry .... It must he something very special.
c13060 +++$+++ I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
c13060 +++$+++ Oh ... Jesus!
c24507 +++$+++ He flies as well, then . . .
c24507 +++$+++ Constantly.
c24507 +++$+++ He has powers as we do . . .
c24507 +++$+++ We will bring him to his knees!
c07429 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c07429 +++$+++ I said, I'm not my sister.
c07429 +++$+++ I know that.
c07429 +++$+++ Do you?
c07429 +++$+++ Very well, then.
c01271 +++$+++ It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
c01271 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c01271 +++$+++ If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
c01271 +++$+++ I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
c01534 +++$+++ Eve?!
c01534 +++$+++ Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
c01534 +++$+++ I'm really sorry!
c01534 +++$+++ What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
c01534 +++$+++ I know...and I'm really sorry.
c01534 +++$+++ Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
c01534 +++$+++ Goodnight!
c22590 +++$+++ Let them take it!
c22590 +++$+++ Over my dead body.
c22590 +++$+++ I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
c22590 +++$+++ Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
c25085 +++$+++ My name is Calloway.
c25085 +++$+++ Martins.
c25085 +++$+++ You a friend of Lime's?
c25085 +++$+++ Yes.
c25085 +++$+++ No.
c12542 +++$+++ The bitched-out babe in back here is one Anna Tassio--we met one dark and stormy night in a Blair Witch chat room, we all did--
c12542 +++$+++ --Christ almighty--
c12542 +++$+++ --but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
c12542 +++$+++ --a six week bun in the oven--
c17477 +++$+++ No deal.
c17477 +++$+++ Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
c17477 +++$+++ Is that right?
c17477 +++$+++ Nice talk, Sugarmouth.
c15925 +++$+++ The well-kept secret is whether any of them has won your heart.
c15925 +++$+++ No.
c15925 +++$+++ Why?
c15925 +++$+++ I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
c15925 +++$+++ And there is no maiden in the whole world who inspires you?
c15925 +++$+++ There is one.
c15925 +++$+++ Who?!
c15925 +++$+++ You.
c15925 +++$+++ Me?
c15925 +++$+++ Yes. I would swear my love to you.
c15925 +++$+++ I cannot love as a woman the lady who will be wife to my King and my friend. And, in pledging my love to you, I cannot love any other woman.
c00993 +++$+++ Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
c00993 +++$+++ This isn't a game.
c00993 +++$+++ Quite right, but we still make the rules.
c00993 +++$+++ Rules are made to be broken.
c00993 +++$+++ People, too.
c00993 +++$+++ You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
c23453 +++$+++ Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
c23453 +++$+++ He's crazy.
c23453 +++$+++ No, he's not. You are.
c23453 +++$+++ You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
c23453 +++$+++ Fuck you, kid.
c07893 +++$+++ What are you doing?
c07893 +++$+++ I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
c07893 +++$+++ But they don't have a case against you.
c07893 +++$+++ Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
c07893 +++$+++ Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
c07893 +++$+++ Don't make no difference no more.
c07893 +++$+++ What friends?
c06634 +++$+++ It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
c06634 +++$+++ Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
c06634 +++$+++ Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
c06634 +++$+++ Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
c06634 +++$+++ Yes. That is to say--
c06634 +++$+++ Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
c06634 +++$+++ Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
c06634 +++$+++ That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
c06634 +++$+++ Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
c17185 +++$+++ You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
c17185 +++$+++ Huh?
c17185 +++$+++ To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
c17185 +++$+++ You mean, like posed for pictures?
c17185 +++$+++ Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
c17185 +++$+++ What's to sketch?
c17185 +++$+++ You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
c17185 +++$+++ Broke is more like it.
c17185 +++$+++ But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
c17185 +++$+++ Football in college.
c17185 +++$+++ You went to university?
c17185 +++$+++ Yes.  You were a Marine.
c06979 +++$+++ I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
c06979 +++$+++ Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
c06979 +++$+++ I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
c06979 +++$+++ But, gentlemen, I am afraid...
c27146 +++$+++ I say something funny?
c27146 +++$+++ No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
c27146 +++$+++ Yeah, but...
c21009 +++$+++ You haven't slept with her, have you?
c21009 +++$+++ That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
c21009 +++$+++ 'No comment' means 'yes.'
c21009 +++$+++ No, it doesn't.
c21009 +++$+++ Do you ever masturbate?
c21009 +++$+++ You see -- it means 'yes.'
c05878 +++$+++ Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
c05878 +++$+++ I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
c05878 +++$+++ You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
c05878 +++$+++ Because, my son, I am placing in your hands the future and destiny of Shangri-La.  For I am going to die.
c11752 +++$+++ Is that why you didn't want to talk about women before?
c11752 +++$+++ I didn't want to complicate the situation.
c11752 +++$+++ Attraction is a complication?
c11752 +++$+++ It can be.
c11752 +++$+++ It happened to you before?
c11752 +++$+++ Yes.
c11752 +++$+++ Who was she?
c11752 +++$+++ Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
c11752 +++$+++ What happened to her?
c11752 +++$+++ She was taken.
c11752 +++$+++ Did you --
c11752 +++$+++ No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
c11752 +++$+++ Was she the only one?
c11752 +++$+++ After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
c11752 +++$+++ I'm not sure that I care anymore.
c23583 +++$+++ You know I'm going to be twenty-five in June?
c23583 +++$+++ You are?
c23583 +++$+++ That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
c23583 +++$+++ About what?
c23583 +++$+++ About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
c23583 +++$+++ What's in Florida?
c23583 +++$+++ Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
c23583 +++$+++ Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
c23583 +++$+++ Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
c23583 +++$+++ You're entitled.
c23583 +++$+++ Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
c23583 +++$+++ Yeah.  With money like Rockefeller, and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller -
c23583 +++$+++ I want mine to wear glasses.
c23583 +++$+++ Glasses?
c23583 +++$+++ Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
c23583 +++$+++ They get those weak eyes from reading - you know, all those long columns of tiny figures in the Wall Street Journal.
c02860 +++$+++ Somebody's there, Barry.
c02860 +++$+++ Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
c02860 +++$+++ I need you so much, Claudette.
c00703 +++$+++ What are you doing here?
c00703 +++$+++ I wanted to see you.
c00703 +++$+++ Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
c00703 +++$+++ David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
c00703 +++$+++ I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
c00703 +++$+++ Yes.
c00703 +++$+++ Get out of here, Jack!
c00703 +++$+++ David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
c00703 +++$+++ A monster. I know, I know.
c00703 +++$+++ You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
c00703 +++$+++ Jack, are you really dead?
c00703 +++$+++ What do you think?
c00703 +++$+++ I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
c00703 +++$+++ You must believe me.
c00703 +++$+++ What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
c00703 +++$+++ I will not accept this! Now go away!
c05111 +++$+++ Hey. Knock it off. I don't want to have to listen to this while we're out there...
c05111 +++$+++ What do you mean 'We...?'
c05111 +++$+++ It's my charter. My party.
c05111 +++$+++ You got it.
c08744 +++$+++ You want to fuck her?
c08744 +++$+++ Stop it.
c08744 +++$+++ You behave as though you want to fuck her.
c08744 +++$+++ Rheya.  Not here.
c08744 +++$+++ And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
c08744 +++$+++ Let's go home.
c08744 +++$+++ You go home.
c08744 +++$+++ You talk like an actor.
c12896 +++$+++ Is it true?
c12896 +++$+++ Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
c12896 +++$+++ How the hell should I know?
c25231 +++$+++ Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
c25231 +++$+++ When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
c25231 +++$+++ You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
c18299 +++$+++ Mrs. Rand.
c18299 +++$+++ Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
c18299 +++$+++ But, Mrs. Rand --
c18299 +++$+++ I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
c18299 +++$+++ I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
c27257 +++$+++ I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
c27257 +++$+++ Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
c27257 +++$+++ I'd sooner wait outside.
c27257 +++$+++ But why?  Why?
c27257 +++$+++ Because I'm still scared!
c27257 +++$+++ Ohh!
c23249 +++$+++ Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
c23249 +++$+++ Talking to Tony.
c23249 +++$+++ No.  It's the little boy that lives in my mouth.
c03664 +++$+++ Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
c03664 +++$+++ Nothing.
c03664 +++$+++ You're kidding with that answer, right?
c03664 +++$+++ I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
c03664 +++$+++ Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
c03664 +++$+++ Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
c03664 +++$+++ It's an option.
c03664 +++$+++ Well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, I wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
c03664 +++$+++ Just forget it...
c14111 +++$+++ How much money did you leave up there?
c14111 +++$+++ Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
c14111 +++$+++ You're trusting.
c14111 +++$+++ Why do you say that?
c14111 +++$+++ How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
c14111 +++$+++ Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
c14111 +++$+++ Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
c14111 +++$+++ I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
c14111 +++$+++ Do you think anyone can see us down here?
c14111 +++$+++ Why? You wanna have sex or something?
c14111 +++$+++ Ooh! Can we?!
c14111 +++$+++ Really?
c14111 +++$+++ I was kidding.
c14111 +++$+++ Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
c14111 +++$+++ Typically male point of view.
c14111 +++$+++ How do you figure?
c14111 +++$+++ You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
c14111 +++$+++ Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
c14111 +++$+++ "Be there?"
c14111 +++$+++ Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
c14111 +++$+++ How flattering.
c14111 +++$+++ Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
c14111 +++$+++ Oh, you think so?
c14111 +++$+++ A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
c14111 +++$+++ And I actually date you?
c14111 +++$+++ Something wrong?
c14111 +++$+++ I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
c14111 +++$+++ I touched a nerve.
c14111 +++$+++ I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
c14111 +++$+++ It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
c14111 +++$+++ You were making a generalization about "broads!"
c14111 +++$+++ These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
c14111 +++$+++ How many?
c14111 +++$+++ How many what?
c14111 +++$+++ How many girls have you slept with?
c14111 +++$+++ How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
c14111 +++$+++ We might have; I don't remember. How many?
c14111 +++$+++ Including you?
c14111 +++$+++ It better be up to and including me.
c14111 +++$+++ Twelve.
c14111 +++$+++ Including you; yes.
c16946 +++$+++ When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
c16946 +++$+++ He took the day off.
c16946 +++$+++ Can't leave the desk.
c16854 +++$+++ Sidney remains optimistic.
c16854 +++$+++ Sidney.
c16854 +++$+++ Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
c16854 +++$+++ I was educated by nuns.
c16854 +++$+++ Yes.
c16854 +++$+++ I have excellent long-term memory.
c16854 +++$+++ Yes.
c16854 +++$+++ I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
c16854 +++$+++ Yes, Peter.
c16854 +++$+++ But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
c16854 +++$+++ You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
c16854 +++$+++ What color?
c16854 +++$+++ What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
c16854 +++$+++ Burnt sienna.
c16854 +++$+++ Mine was cobalt blue.
c16854 +++$+++ This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
c16854 +++$+++ Yes.
c16854 +++$+++ I kissed her while she was laughing.
c16854 +++$+++ I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
c13444 +++$+++ No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
c13444 +++$+++ Hi. Good.
c13444 +++$+++ I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
c13444 +++$+++ Well, I've been busy.
c13444 +++$+++ Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
c13444 +++$+++ Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
c13444 +++$+++ Yeah.  I think I want my money back.
c13444 +++$+++ What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
c13444 +++$+++ You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
c13444 +++$+++ You can't talk to me like...
c13444 +++$+++ Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my fuckin' money to sleep. You go get my money, or I'll put your fuckin' brain to sleep.
c13444 +++$+++ Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is personal.  I'll be there in the morning. You can fuckin' try me, fatso.
c01577 +++$+++ Oh, no.
c01577 +++$+++ What?
c01577 +++$+++ Honey?
c08541 +++$+++ Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
c08541 +++$+++ Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
c08541 +++$+++ Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
c16539 +++$+++ And what about love?
c16539 +++$+++ What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
c16539 +++$+++ Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
c11806 +++$+++ Yes, it's looks good.....We will use this for the soundtrack and we will have two guys up there with the spotlights. The others will just be house lights.
c11806 +++$+++ Great....How long will it go for?
c11806 +++$+++ Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
c24711 +++$+++ Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
c24711 +++$+++ I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
c24711 +++$+++ That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
c24711 +++$+++ That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
c24711 +++$+++ Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
c01719 +++$+++ See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
c01719 +++$+++ This was in fourth grade.
c01719 +++$+++ Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
c01719 +++$+++ They blamed my family for everything. They always said Mr. Langston saved Anthony's life.
c19937 +++$+++ And what?
c19937 +++$+++ And I won't tell anyone who you are.
c19937 +++$+++ Sounds fair enough.
c19937 +++$+++ It is a deal?
c19937 +++$+++ You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
c07136 +++$+++ ...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
c07136 +++$+++ Most don't.
c07136 +++$+++ You're discouraged.
c07136 +++$+++ You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you.
c01342 +++$+++ So how long will you be in England?
c01342 +++$+++ Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
c01342 +++$+++ You must have a visa or something...
c01342 +++$+++ No, no...
c21875 +++$+++ No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
c21875 +++$+++ Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
c21875 +++$+++ "Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
c21875 +++$+++ "Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
c21875 +++$+++ Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
c21875 +++$+++ Vat?
c21875 +++$+++ OH.  "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy, Yankee Doodle is my ... " Listen, this is not place to talk.  Come!
c21465 +++$+++ Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That beautiful, sensuous woman is a... <u>lesbian</u>?
c21465 +++$+++ Duh...
c21465 +++$+++ Since when?
c21465 +++$+++ Probably since she was born.
c21465 +++$+++ Allright. I admit it: I'm prejudiced. I don't want to work with a homosexual. You got me.
c21465 +++$+++ Okay, Joe...
c21465 +++$+++ I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
c21465 +++$+++ Fine, Joe.
c21465 +++$+++ And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
c21465 +++$+++ Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking: "I hope this guy doesn't touch me. I don't even want him to <u>breathe</u> on me?"
c05344 +++$+++ It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
c05344 +++$+++ You sound like my mother.
c05344 +++$+++ Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
c15683 +++$+++ And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
c15683 +++$+++ No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility...
c15683 +++$+++ Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
c00147 +++$+++ You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it.
c00147 +++$+++ He knew all along.
c00147 +++$+++ That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
c15100 +++$+++ What's ailing that dog?
c15100 +++$+++ I dunno.
c15100 +++$+++ Well ... make him keep quiet.
c15100 +++$+++ And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
c15100 +++$+++ I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
c04502 +++$+++ Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
c04502 +++$+++ No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
c04502 +++$+++ We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
c13627 +++$+++ What?
c13627 +++$+++ He'd bring me carnations.
c13627 +++$+++ So I got it wrong, then.
c13627 +++$+++ Not at all, honey.
c13627 +++$+++ Okay.
c11841 +++$+++ What's with the friggin numbers?
c11841 +++$+++ 28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
c11841 +++$+++ Kinda. Yeah.
c11414 +++$+++ No.
c11414 +++$+++ Okay.
c11414 +++$+++ Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
c11414 +++$+++ I guess.
c11414 +++$+++ Life gets messy.  Ugly messy.  But I don't understand you.  And I don't think I ever understood Lucy.  I don't understand throwing it away.  How do you throw all that away?  Any of it.  I want it all.  You guys want guarantees?  I want the possibilities.  And all kinds of crap comes with that.  A lot of bad shit. And I think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  All the good shit.  All the surprises.  It's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  We'd have had amazing children, you and me.  We'd have had a ride.  You'd have surprised yourself.  I'll never love anybody else, you know.
c11414 +++$+++ Me too.
c11414 +++$+++ Me too.
c22514 +++$+++ You go.
c22514 +++$+++ Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
c22514 +++$+++ I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
c22514 +++$+++ What?
c22514 +++$+++ About forever.
c22514 +++$+++ Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
c16103 +++$+++ In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
c16103 +++$+++ Is that what you used to do?
c16103 +++$+++ My days are not the old days, genius.
c16103 +++$+++ What are they?
c16103 +++$+++ The recent past.
c16103 +++$+++ Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
c16103 +++$+++ How do you know?
c16103 +++$+++ I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
c16103 +++$+++ Oh?
c16103 +++$+++ I guess it's getting serious.
c16103 +++$+++ I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
c22034 +++$+++ Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
c22034 +++$+++ Oh, anywhere downtown.
c22034 +++$+++ Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
c09307 +++$+++ The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
c09307 +++$+++ Yes.
c09307 +++$+++ What did he look like?
c09307 +++$+++ I didn't wait on him. Fifty or so, white, regular build, needed a shave -- that's all I remember.
c09307 +++$+++ He had an orange hat on.
c12550 +++$+++ Was that you laughing?
c12550 +++$+++ What?
c12550 +++$+++ Just now?
c12550 +++$+++ No.
c12550 +++$+++ Just...try and go back to sleep.
c12550 +++$+++ I get dreams. I don't like 'em.
c12550 +++$+++ What'd you dream?
c12550 +++$+++ Here.
c06875 +++$+++ You shot her?
c06875 +++$+++ No.
c06875 +++$+++ Who did?
c06875 +++$+++ I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
c06875 +++$+++ What?
c06875 +++$+++ What the hell are you saying?
c18806 +++$+++ Is that kid still bothering you?
c18806 +++$+++ Which one?
c18806 +++$+++ You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
c18806 +++$+++ That was about a year ago.
c18806 +++$+++ Well, is he?
c18806 +++$+++ That Richard.
c15544 +++$+++ I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund.
c15544 +++$+++ Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland.
c15544 +++$+++ Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history.
c15544 +++$+++ Why?
c15544 +++$+++ A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides.
c15544 +++$+++ Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people.
c21926 +++$+++ You look frightened. Have I been saying something frightening?
c21926 +++$+++ I don't know what you've been saying.
c21926 +++$+++ I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
c21926 +++$+++ Do what?
c21926 +++$+++ Buy a new one! In a new town! Where you won't have to hide your mother!
c21926 +++$+++ Shut up!
c21926 +++$+++ Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
c21926 +++$+++ Leave me alone!
c21926 +++$+++ Leave me alone!
c02374 +++$+++ This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
c02374 +++$+++ I thought everything was working out fine.
c02374 +++$+++ Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
c23780 +++$+++ You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
c23780 +++$+++ Look who's talking!
c23780 +++$+++ Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
c15771 +++$+++ This is just show and tell.
c15771 +++$+++ I'm waiting for the tell part.
c15771 +++$+++ She's calling the shots now.
c15771 +++$+++ You're impressed with her, aren't you?
c15771 +++$+++ She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
c07379 +++$+++ We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house.
c07379 +++$+++ Say fuck.
c07379 +++$+++ Fuck.
c07379 +++$+++ Get the fuck out of my house!
c15810 +++$+++ Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
c15810 +++$+++ And, what, I'm not serious?
c15810 +++$+++ You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
c15810 +++$+++ "Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
c15810 +++$+++ <u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
c27450 +++$+++ What?
c27450 +++$+++ I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
c27450 +++$+++ Nor to Elizabeth.
c27450 +++$+++ We all have our feelings.  I know that I have mine.  And... I wouldn't want to hurt yours.
c26642 +++$+++ When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
c26642 +++$+++ I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
c26642 +++$+++ Why did you jump?
c26642 +++$+++ What was it inside that told you to jump?
c02282 +++$+++ So, I met a new friend.
c02282 +++$+++ Would you like to talk about this friend?
c02282 +++$+++ His name is Frank.
c02282 +++$+++ Frank.
c02282 +++$+++ I think he saved my life.
c02282 +++$+++ How so?
c02282 +++$+++ Don't you watch the news?
c02282 +++$+++ A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
c02586 +++$+++ The antennae array's completely fried, we've got no radio, no laser, no highgain... No one's going to be coming to help us.
c02586 +++$+++ How much oh-two do we have?
c02586 +++$+++ Oxygen is not the problem.
c02586 +++$+++ Carbon dioxide?
c02586 +++$+++ It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
c02586 +++$+++ We can take the filters from the Clark...
c02586 +++$+++ I thought of that, with the filters from the Clark, we've got enough breathable air for twenty hours. After that, we'd better be on our way home.
c02586 +++$+++ What about the life readings you picked up?
c02586 +++$+++ The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
c02586 +++$+++ What's causing the readings?
c02586 +++$+++ So where is the rest of the crew? We've been over every inch of this ship and all we've found is blood. Dr. Weir? Any suggestions?
c11972 +++$+++ Where were you tonight?
c11972 +++$+++ Home. Watching TV.
c11972 +++$+++ All night?
c11972 +++$+++ Were you drinking?
c18716 +++$+++ Yes, Sir.
c18716 +++$+++ As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
c18716 +++$+++ I see .. Well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. I'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
c04714 +++$+++ I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
c04714 +++$+++ Well what does he want?
c04714 +++$+++ He has a reputation for being tough.
c08714 +++$+++ -- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
c08714 +++$+++ Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
c08714 +++$+++ I'm working on it.
c08714 +++$+++ It's gettin' done Sid.
c23473 +++$+++ His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
c23473 +++$+++ You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
c23473 +++$+++ Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
c23473 +++$+++ Jesus.
c23473 +++$+++ Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
c23473 +++$+++ It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
c23473 +++$+++ No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
c23473 +++$+++ Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.
c14215 +++$+++ No.
c14215 +++$+++ Oh, my, yes.
c14215 +++$+++ Get outta here!  You and Louis?
c14215 +++$+++ Unbelievable...  ...you hearing this?  Unbelievable.
c03300 +++$+++ I didn't have a chance to thank you.
c03300 +++$+++ What did I do?
c03300 +++$+++ Got me out of trouble.
c03300 +++$+++ Nonsense- Samuel would have done something.
c03300 +++$+++ We need to talk.
c03300 +++$+++ Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
c03300 +++$+++ Actually, no.
c03300 +++$+++ Somehow I guessed.
c01644 +++$+++ Alright, now tell me. What is it?
c01644 +++$+++ There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. Sometimes, in some cases, it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment, you know, sneak in and hide and observe.
c01644 +++$+++ You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
c01644 +++$+++ Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
c01644 +++$+++ It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
c01644 +++$+++ Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
c01644 +++$+++ Now, how are you going to do that?
c01644 +++$+++ Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
c01644 +++$+++ What will I say when she comes to the door?
c01644 +++$+++ You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
c01644 +++$+++ I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
c01644 +++$+++ You've got a point there.
c06692 +++$+++ -- you crazy? You can't do this!
c06692 +++$+++ Sure I can, Lionel.
c06692 +++$+++ See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here.
c05160 +++$+++ Am I supposed to feel happy now?
c05160 +++$+++ You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
c05160 +++$+++ Viscera?
c05160 +++$+++ We'd better get back downstairs ASAP.
c02975 +++$+++ Did you talk with Humphries?
c02975 +++$+++ This is not the place...
c02975 +++$+++ Just tell me, did you talk with him?
c02975 +++$+++ Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say?
c17206 +++$+++ After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
c17206 +++$+++ I thought you'd given up on my picture.
c17206 +++$+++ Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
c24325 +++$+++ It was Lucy!  Lucy went to the cops!
c24325 +++$+++ Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
c24325 +++$+++ She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
c24325 +++$+++ That you?
c24325 +++$+++ Yeah, hold on.
c24325 +++$+++ Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
c24325 +++$+++ For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
c22256 +++$+++ Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
c22256 +++$+++ Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
c22256 +++$+++ 'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
c22256 +++$+++ I thought all for the best.
c22256 +++$+++ NO! Mercutio!
c01606 +++$+++ Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
c01606 +++$+++ Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
c01606 +++$+++ Oh my God. Is her son OK?
c14398 +++$+++ I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
c14398 +++$+++ Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
c14398 +++$+++ I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
c14398 +++$+++ Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
c14398 +++$+++ Ah ha.  What did he want?
c14398 +++$+++ Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
c14398 +++$+++ I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
c14398 +++$+++ Listen, you want my advice?  Steer clear.  He's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' He's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that I will be immortal if he has some of my spunk.  I'm offended.  Right away I smell <u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care for his drift.  I sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from Jesus to mend his ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And what's funny is, now I don't mind bein' inside.  If I was out, even Born Again, I'd probably get restless again.  It's maybe better I stay here, what do you think?
c14398 +++$+++ I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
c14398 +++$+++ You come and visit.
c14398 +++$+++ Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
c17853 +++$+++ You going to pull a Big Gulp with that?
c17853 +++$+++ No, but if you're nice I'll let you buy me a Slurpee. You know your 7-11speak pretty well.
c17853 +++$+++ I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
c17853 +++$+++ Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
c17853 +++$+++ I didn't. Cherry.
c25154 +++$+++ Hello...?
c25154 +++$+++ Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
c25154 +++$+++ What is happening?
c25154 +++$+++ Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
c25154 +++$+++ Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
c19678 +++$+++ So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
c19678 +++$+++ Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
c19678 +++$+++ What?
c22342 +++$+++ When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
c22342 +++$+++ Shouldn't be long.  A couple of weeks maybe.
c22342 +++$+++ It'll be more than enough.  We can get out of here...
c14831 +++$+++ I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
c14831 +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
c14831 +++$+++ You are mistaken.
c24632 +++$+++ Are you sleeping?
c24632 +++$+++ No.
c24632 +++$+++ Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
c24632 +++$+++ You seem...I don't know...well, distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to.
c11571 +++$+++ Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
c11571 +++$+++ Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
c11571 +++$+++ Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
c11571 +++$+++ Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
c11571 +++$+++ Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
c11571 +++$+++ I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
c11571 +++$+++ Now, Fran --
c11571 +++$+++ Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.
c02810 +++$+++ You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
c02810 +++$+++ Yes, Mama.
c02810 +++$+++ Yes, Mama.
c01383 +++$+++ He black alright, he just ain't blue.
c01383 +++$+++ Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
c01383 +++$+++ You seen my snake-skin shoes?
c11252 +++$+++ Jesus...
c11252 +++$+++ How well did, er, do you know him?
c11252 +++$+++ Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
c11252 +++$+++ No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
c11252 +++$+++ Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
c11252 +++$+++ Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
c11252 +++$+++ What do you mean, maniacs?
c11252 +++$+++ Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
c03850 +++$+++ You are at the University, Candy?
c03850 +++$+++ Yes, I am.
c03850 +++$+++ And what are you studying?
c03850 +++$+++ Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.
c03850 +++$+++ Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
c07147 +++$+++ ...This month's checks.
c07147 +++$+++ That DEA agent called again. You don't want to talk to him?
c07147 +++$+++ He's goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
c14274 +++$+++ See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
c14274 +++$+++ Nothing is easy.
c14274 +++$+++ How long have we known each other, Jerry?
c14274 +++$+++ Till today, I haven't believed a word.  Now, I'm curious.  Six months, eleven days.  I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me.  Where to?
c21153 +++$+++ Right now?
c21153 +++$+++ He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
c21153 +++$+++ I'm gonna take her home first.
c21153 +++$+++ I'd get over there, Terry. I'll take the little lady home.
c21153 +++$+++ You know Johnny when he gets mad.
c07946 +++$+++ Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
c07946 +++$+++ I'm not much on rear window ethics.
c07946 +++$+++ Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
c07946 +++$+++ Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
c07946 +++$+++ You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
c15784 +++$+++ I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
c15784 +++$+++ Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
c15784 +++$+++ Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
c15784 +++$+++ I'll say.  Holy moley.
c15784 +++$+++ Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
c06645 +++$+++ Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
c06645 +++$+++ What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
c06645 +++$+++ Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
c06253 +++$+++ I'm sorry we gotta rush like this...
c06253 +++$+++ That's all right, that's all right...
c06253 +++$+++ I'm gonna see you tonight...
c26653 +++$+++ Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
c26653 +++$+++ Please answer my question.
c26653 +++$+++ I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
c26653 +++$+++ What is her name?
c26653 +++$+++ Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
c26653 +++$+++ Carlotta Valdes?
c26653 +++$+++ Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
c26653 +++$+++ How long has she had the room?
c26653 +++$+++ Oh, it must be two weeks. Yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
c26653 +++$+++ Does she sleep here? Ever?
c26653 +++$+++ When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
c06298 +++$+++ O'Reilly!
c06298 +++$+++ Yes, sir?
c06298 +++$+++ Dammit, Radar, wait till I call you! Tell Major Burns...
c06298 +++$+++ Yes, dammit, and...
c26328 +++$+++ You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her.  How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
c26328 +++$+++ She's dead.
c26328 +++$+++ Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
c26328 +++$+++ I've had time to get over it.
c26328 +++$+++ You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
c26328 +++$+++ Oz.
c26328 +++$+++ You're too quick for me.
c12016 +++$+++ I.A.'s going to talk to you more about Nilsen.  They're handling the investigation, we're not. Stay in touch with Dr. Gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
c12016 +++$+++ She killed him.
c12016 +++$+++ Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
c12016 +++$+++ Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
c12016 +++$+++ You don't but it, do you?  She knew nobody would but it.  She knew I'd say she did it.  And she knew nobody would buy it.
c13443 +++$+++ Yeah, that works out.
c13443 +++$+++ But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
c13443 +++$+++ You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
c13443 +++$+++ Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
c13443 +++$+++ So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
c13443 +++$+++ I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
c13443 +++$+++ Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
c09525 +++$+++ You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
c09525 +++$+++ Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
c09525 +++$+++ So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
c09525 +++$+++ My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
c09525 +++$+++ Which is?
c09525 +++$+++ Emily.  Just kidding.
c09525 +++$+++ The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
c09525 +++$+++ As in the...?
c09525 +++$+++ As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
c09525 +++$+++ Right.
c17779 +++$+++ She threw a punch at a man on the team.
c17779 +++$+++ Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
c17779 +++$+++ What is that supposed to mean...?
c17779 +++$+++ I think its meaning is clear.
c17779 +++$+++ What, you're saying she was overwrought.
c17779 +++$+++ That could be.
c17779 +++$+++ Because that's understandable, because. She blew the raid.
c17779 +++$+++ One moment, I'm not done with you...  Give him the file...
c21784 +++$+++ Hi, Barney!
c21784 +++$+++ Miss Vivian.
c21784 +++$+++ Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
c21784 +++$+++ Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
c21784 +++$+++ Yeah, well, I check out today.
c21784 +++$+++ You're not accompanying him to New York?
c21784 +++$+++ Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
c14186 +++$+++ No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
c14186 +++$+++ Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
c14186 +++$+++ What about Basil? Where's my snake?
c14186 +++$+++ Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
c14186 +++$+++ Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
c12072 +++$+++ ... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
c12072 +++$+++ "We"?  You and...
c12072 +++$+++ Yes and no...
c14901 +++$+++ This stuff really works? No shit?
c14901 +++$+++ Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
c14901 +++$+++ I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
c16321 +++$+++ Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
c16321 +++$+++ Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
c16321 +++$+++ Yeah, couple a muskies. No pike yet. How d'you feel?
c16321 +++$+++ Oh, fine.
c16321 +++$+++ Not on your feet too much?
c16321 +++$+++ No, no.
c16321 +++$+++ You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
c16321 +++$+++ Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
c16321 +++$+++ Was it reasonable?
c16321 +++$+++ Yah, it's good. No pike yet, but it's good.
c13260 +++$+++ I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
c13260 +++$+++ I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
c13260 +++$+++ You sure?
c13260 +++$+++ Mmkay.
c20128 +++$+++ You sure you didn't see one of these?
c20128 +++$+++ Gross. What is it?
c20128 +++$+++ No way. I see one of those, I'd puke.
c16339 +++$+++ We'll split up the week.  You can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
c16339 +++$+++ You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
c16339 +++$+++ I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
c16339 +++$+++ Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
c16339 +++$+++ I don't know -- am I?
c08549 +++$+++ With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
c08549 +++$+++ We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
c08549 +++$+++ And what may I ask brought this on?
c02798 +++$+++ Where you goin'?
c02798 +++$+++ Wherever they're going, I'm going.
c02798 +++$+++ Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
c19959 +++$+++ 'Yes' what?
c19959 +++$+++ 'Yes' is the answer to your question.
c19959 +++$+++ I believe you did.
c21804 +++$+++ Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.
c21804 +++$+++ What do I do?
c21804 +++$+++ Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini.  Which way is my way?
c10826 +++$+++ I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
c10826 +++$+++ To do what?
c10826 +++$+++ But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
c07055 +++$+++ Oh, I suppose you would've just let them take over.  These aren't fraternity pranks, John.  It's anarchy.  A revolution!
c07055 +++$+++ I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
c07055 +++$+++ Why not?
c07055 +++$+++ I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance.
c25088 +++$+++ Get the next plane.
c25088 +++$+++ As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
c25088 +++$+++ Do you mind if I use that line in my next Western? You can't chuck me out, my papers are in order.
c02774 +++$+++ Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
c02774 +++$+++ I always told ya, Frances. You got real ability.
c02774 +++$+++ I know what ability you're interested in.
c02774 +++$+++ Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
c02774 +++$+++ Yeah? What is he -- muscleman? Lifeguard?
c25812 +++$+++ How much did you lose?
c25812 +++$+++ About twelve hundred.
c25812 +++$+++ It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
c01866 +++$+++ ...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
c01866 +++$+++ How long will I be in here?
c01866 +++$+++ How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
c13694 +++$+++ Reggie -- stop!
c13694 +++$+++ Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
c13694 +++$+++ I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
c13694 +++$+++ Don't be an idiot!
c07523 +++$+++ What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
c07523 +++$+++ Aaabout...?
c07523 +++$+++ This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
c07523 +++$+++ A man?
c07523 +++$+++ Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
c07523 +++$+++ I'm not sure.  That's the funny thing about him.  He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.
c26422 +++$+++ Okay, I don't want to play this game anymore.
c26422 +++$+++ It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
c26422 +++$+++ Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.
c12979 +++$+++ Oh, thank God.
c12979 +++$+++ I'm still here.
c12979 +++$+++ You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
c17989 +++$+++ The cab's waiting!
c17989 +++$+++ Where should I hide the car keys?
c17989 +++$+++ Did you lock the garage door?
c23932 +++$+++ I thought you were KIA, Johnny...
c23932 +++$+++ That was just a mix up.
c23932 +++$+++ What happened to your eye ?
c13890 +++$+++ Where did you get this material?
c13890 +++$+++ The apple core club.
c13890 +++$+++ The apple core?
c13890 +++$+++ No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
c13890 +++$+++ How do they do that?
c13890 +++$+++ But what?
c03601 +++$+++ Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
c03601 +++$+++ Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
c03601 +++$+++ Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
c07356 +++$+++ So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
c07356 +++$+++ I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
c07356 +++$+++ Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
c07356 +++$+++ But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
c07356 +++$+++ It's mine.
c19095 +++$+++ He just came up screaming.
c19095 +++$+++ Did he say anything?
c19095 +++$+++ He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
c19095 +++$+++ And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
c19095 +++$+++ The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
c19095 +++$+++ <u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
c19095 +++$+++ Yes.
c19095 +++$+++ Is the dead guy in there?
c19095 +++$+++ Um.  No, no.  Let's go.
c06591 +++$+++ No. Are you?
c06591 +++$+++ No.
c06591 +++$+++ You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
c06591 +++$+++ Why not?
c00157 +++$+++ Good morning. How's it going?
c00157 +++$+++ Are you reasonably awake?
c00157 +++$+++ Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
c00157 +++$+++ Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
c00157 +++$+++ No.
c25167 +++$+++ Do you have a suit?  Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too.  And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you?
c25167 +++$+++ Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
c25167 +++$+++ So what?
c25167 +++$+++ I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they?
c23617 +++$+++ What's going on with you two?
c23617 +++$+++ I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she's getting married.
c23617 +++$+++ There's a reason I always tell that Tony Pee-Pants story, you know.
c23617 +++$+++ Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
c23617 +++$+++ Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn't split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
c23617 +++$+++ Mom, please.
c23617 +++$+++ Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasn't just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
c23617 +++$+++ So she flirted with Tony, and you got mad and sent him away. Who did that leave?  You and Amy. Reunited.
c00845 +++$+++ Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
c00845 +++$+++ Lucky, I guess.
c00845 +++$+++ That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture?
c00845 +++$+++ Uh huh.
c00845 +++$+++ Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
c14606 +++$+++ Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
c14606 +++$+++ You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
c14606 +++$+++ This sack of shit is called Tin- Tin.
c14606 +++$+++ Don't any of your little pals have real, grown up names?
c14606 +++$+++ Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
c10421 +++$+++ Kathy Price...
c10421 +++$+++ Yes...
c10421 +++$+++ Yes.
c23208 +++$+++ Want a drink?
c23208 +++$+++ No thanks.
c23208 +++$+++ Okay, thanks.
c18055 +++$+++ Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
c18055 +++$+++ You won't die if you let me help.
c18055 +++$+++ Bullshit!
c18055 +++$+++ But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
c18055 +++$+++ You can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
c04977 +++$+++ That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?
c04977 +++$+++ No.
c04977 +++$+++ Does that bother you?
c25805 +++$+++ Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
c25805 +++$+++ I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
c25805 +++$+++ But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
c25805 +++$+++ Somebody's got to do it--
c25805 +++$+++ Well, let's hear the poem--
c25805 +++$+++ Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
c25805 +++$+++ Very good, Mary--
c25805 +++$+++ But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
c25805 +++$+++ What's the matter, Mary?
c25805 +++$+++ I'm getting seasick--
c25805 +++$+++ H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
c25805 +++$+++ Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
c11804 +++$+++ There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
c11804 +++$+++ It's not so much.
c11804 +++$+++ Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
c11804 +++$+++ Donations only! And make the thing non-lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.
c10201 +++$+++ And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
c10201 +++$+++ Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
c10201 +++$+++ Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
c10201 +++$+++ I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.
c05716 +++$+++ Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
c05716 +++$+++ I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
c05716 +++$+++ Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
c25311 +++$+++ What is it?
c25311 +++$+++ This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I'm terribly sorry to disturb you but there's been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
c25311 +++$+++ We need a double-room and as I understand you're here alone we'd be much obliged if you'd agree to move to a single room...
c21143 +++$+++ My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
c21143 +++$+++ She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
c21143 +++$+++ A pig!  A pig!  She's saying he's a pig.
c01209 +++$+++ Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
c01209 +++$+++ Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
c01209 +++$+++ Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
c01209 +++$+++ Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
c01209 +++$+++ Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
c01209 +++$+++ How be dat?
c01209 +++$+++ I don't know who I am.
c01209 +++$+++ Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother.
c20318 +++$+++ I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
c20318 +++$+++ You were a tiger last night.
c20318 +++$+++ And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
c20318 +++$+++ Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
c20318 +++$+++ So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
c20318 +++$+++ I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
c05220 +++$+++ Any word from that gallery?
c05220 +++$+++ Not yet.
c05220 +++$+++ Nervous?
c05220 +++$+++ You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
c00519 +++$+++ What's this?  What's going on?
c00519 +++$+++ Nothing.
c00519 +++$+++ Shouldn't we examine their personal effects?
c25347 +++$+++ ... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
c25347 +++$+++ I'm staying, Jean.
c25347 +++$+++ No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
c25347 +++$+++ Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
c11159 +++$+++ There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
c11159 +++$+++ --it was all in hundreds, wasn't it?
c11159 +++$+++ A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
c11159 +++$+++ Could buy a lot of steaks, 350,000 dollars.
c11159 +++$+++ I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
c11159 +++$+++ Which people?
c11159 +++$+++ The ones who could disburse the money.
c11159 +++$+++ Who were they?
c11159 +++$+++ Sloan knew which five, didn't he?
c24577 +++$+++ No, Billy.  We can't drop the lawsuit.  You know how much we need the money.
c24577 +++$+++ Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
c24577 +++$+++ It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
c24577 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c02006 +++$+++ Take your time.
c02006 +++$+++ What?
c02006 +++$+++ Being patient.  Don't rush things.  I get it.
c03603 +++$+++ Well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?
c03603 +++$+++ And I don't just mean the SEC. We could have the FBI breathing down our necks.
c03603 +++$+++ I certainly hope not.
c03603 +++$+++ I can keep my mouth shut, Mister Fellowes.
c27310 +++$+++ The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.
c27310 +++$+++ My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?
c27310 +++$+++ Us.  You mean the Watchmen.
c21569 +++$+++ You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
c21569 +++$+++ I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
c21569 +++$+++ And do you amuse the guests?
c21569 +++$+++ No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
c21569 +++$+++ You're drinking it.
c21569 +++$+++ I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
c21569 +++$+++ Would it make you anymore amusing?
c21569 +++$+++ Whatever you say.
c21569 +++$+++ I didn't say anything.
c21569 +++$+++ I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
c03051 +++$+++ It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
c03051 +++$+++ My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
c03051 +++$+++ War?  No!  I did not!  When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable.  There's no middle ground at all?  We're the King's children!
c15310 +++$+++ Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
c15310 +++$+++ Your Reverence.
c15310 +++$+++ Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
c11880 +++$+++ No, Marty. Shemp's molecular structure is completely intact!
c11880 +++$+++ Then where the hell is he?
c11880 +++$+++ The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
c11880 +++$+++ The future? What are you talking about? Where's Shemp?!
c11880 +++$+++ Now hold on a minute, Professor! Hold the phone. Are you trying to tell me that this -- all of this here -- that this is -- it's a -- a --
c05797 +++$+++ How'd the camera get so high like that?
c05797 +++$+++ And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
c05797 +++$+++ Right... This just glided along.
c20559 +++$+++ Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
c20559 +++$+++ Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
c20559 +++$+++ ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
c15115 +++$+++ I wanted to give it all to the church.
c15115 +++$+++ My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
c15115 +++$+++ That isn't it. It's ... the loneliness, Mr. Scratch ... the loneliness!
c15115 +++$+++ The loneliness? Lonely with all your gold, Mister Stevens? That hardly makes sense.
c15115 +++$+++ I want someone to talk to ...
c15115 +++$+++ You can talk to me ...
c15115 +++$+++ No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
c15115 +++$+++ Why don't you?
c15115 +++$+++ Oh, that's what you want -- well, you can be perfectly honest with Jabez Stone -- now.
c15581 +++$+++ What <u>is</u> that?
c15581 +++$+++ It's a SAT-tracker.
c15581 +++$+++ I don't know what that means.
c15581 +++$+++ Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
c15581 +++$+++ I don't know what that means.
c15581 +++$+++ 230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
c15581 +++$+++ I don't know what that means.
c15581 +++$+++ It means the NSA can read the time off your wristwatch.
c15581 +++$+++ Why are they after <u>me</u>?
c15581 +++$+++ If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
c15581 +++$+++ Pal, you're cooked. It's over. What you did, who you were...that's done. I'd find a quiet job somewhere shoveling snow.
c10354 +++$+++ Oh, the uncle is missing.
c10354 +++$+++ Not Cole's Uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
c10354 +++$+++ So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
c10354 +++$+++ Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
c10354 +++$+++ The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
c10354 +++$+++ Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
c10354 +++$+++ Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
c23446 +++$+++ And what about for you?
c23446 +++$+++ Huh?
c23446 +++$+++ What about for you?
c23446 +++$+++ For me?  I'll have the same thing.
c23446 +++$+++ Do me a favor, will you?
c23446 +++$+++ What's that, Sol?
c23446 +++$+++ Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
c23446 +++$+++ What's the difference?
c23446 +++$+++ It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
c23446 +++$+++ Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
c03401 +++$+++ If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
c03401 +++$+++ Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
c03401 +++$+++ It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
c03401 +++$+++ So I understand.
c03401 +++$+++ Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
c03401 +++$+++ You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
c03401 +++$+++ A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
c03401 +++$+++ Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
c03401 +++$+++ The Senators admire you.
c03401 +++$+++ They fear me.
c03401 +++$+++ I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
c19851 +++$+++ Out!!!!
c19851 +++$+++ C'mon Johnny.
c19851 +++$+++ Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
c11463 +++$+++ Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
c11463 +++$+++ General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
c11463 +++$+++ Look.  How many other Princesses are there?
c11463 +++$+++ Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
c11463 +++$+++ And only you can become a Queen?
c11463 +++$+++ Well...no, but --
c11463 +++$+++ Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
c20159 +++$+++ Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week.
c20159 +++$+++ I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
c20159 +++$+++ Don't talk to me like that.
c20159 +++$+++ Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
c20159 +++$+++ Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
c20159 +++$+++ Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
c20159 +++$+++ I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
c20159 +++$+++ That's disgusting.
c20709 +++$+++ Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
c20709 +++$+++ No.
c20709 +++$+++ You got a place to stay?
c20709 +++$+++ No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
c20709 +++$+++ You in music?
c20709 +++$+++ Get in.
c22841 +++$+++ They found another note?
c22841 +++$+++ Uh-huh. Another News clipping. Another one about Sid's mom. Dewey, whether we like it  or not it looks like we're going to have to  go back into our past.
c22841 +++$+++ You mean OUR past as in Me and Sid. This has nothing to do with you Gale.
c22841 +++$+++ This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
c22841 +++$+++ Do you really mean it this time Gale?
c22841 +++$+++ Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
c22841 +++$+++ Why would the police come to you?
c22841 +++$+++ Again, I am the author of the definitive book on the Woodsboro murders.!  What about you?
c22841 +++$+++ What about me?
c22841 +++$+++ You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
c22841 +++$+++ So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
c22841 +++$+++ It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
c22841 +++$+++ What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
c22841 +++$+++ It didn't work Dewey.  We tried,  we're different.
c22841 +++$+++ You used to say that was our strength.
c22841 +++$+++ Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
c22841 +++$+++ Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
c22841 +++$+++ All of what Dewey?  You do know something, don't you?
c22841 +++$+++ Off the record.
c22841 +++$+++ Always.
c22841 +++$+++ Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
c22841 +++$+++ And?
c22841 +++$+++ The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
c22841 +++$+++ Someone stole Sid's file?
c22841 +++$+++ I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
c22841 +++$+++ I'm sorry, this is too good!
c22841 +++$+++ What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
c22841 +++$+++ Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it?
c22841 +++$+++ And who is that?
c09659 +++$+++ Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods.
c09659 +++$+++ Cathy!
c09659 +++$+++ Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
c09659 +++$+++ Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods.  He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it?  I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think?
c18024 +++$+++ My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I was at the police station earlier today--
c18024 +++$+++ I remember you.
c18024 +++$+++ I was wondering if I could talk to you?
c18024 +++$+++ Are you a cop?
c18024 +++$+++ No.  I'm an archaeologist.
c18024 +++$+++ What do you want?
c18024 +++$+++ I don't think we have anything to talk about, Miss Hillman.
c02905 +++$+++ They're gonna search the van.
c02905 +++$+++ As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
c02905 +++$+++ What?
c07848 +++$+++ A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--
c07848 +++$+++ Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
c07848 +++$+++ Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
c13141 +++$+++ It's nice to see you.
c13141 +++$+++ Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
c13141 +++$+++ Why?
c09298 +++$+++ Hey, Sheriff.
c09298 +++$+++ Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
c09298 +++$+++ What does the Manager say?
c09298 +++$+++ Let's take a look.
c17029 +++$+++ Oh, yes, George.
c17029 +++$+++ What does that mean?
c17029 +++$+++ Listen to this.  I have an alibi, I'm going to the Como Inn, why? Why?  The place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  Why?  Because I probably did it.  Are you going to turn me in?  George?  Are you going to turn me in?
c17029 +++$+++ What if you don't get caught?
c17029 +++$+++ They come to you, you going to turn me in?
c17029 +++$+++ Why would they come to me?
c17029 +++$+++ They're going to come to everyone.
c17029 +++$+++ Why would I do it?
c17029 +++$+++ You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
c17029 +++$+++ No.
c17029 +++$+++ Are you sure?
c17029 +++$+++ Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight.  That's something I have to do.  If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this, then I have to come in here...
c15369 +++$+++ So, Mr. Johnson --
c15369 +++$+++ Tor!
c15369 +++$+++ Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
c15369 +++$+++ Mm, not good-lookink enough.
c15369 +++$+++ No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that.
c10268 +++$+++ What, did you get amnesia?...How'd you get here?
c10268 +++$+++ Hauser left me a note.
c10268 +++$+++ Not any more.
c16231 +++$+++ Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
c16231 +++$+++ Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
c16231 +++$+++ What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
c12599 +++$+++ ...Just doin' my job.
c12599 +++$+++ You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
c12599 +++$+++ Well, I don't know... Call it a fringe benefit.
c12599 +++$+++ Most of the night...
c20989 +++$+++ It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
c20989 +++$+++ Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
c20989 +++$+++ But... wait... there are things to say.
c20989 +++$+++ Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
c00202 +++$+++ I been waiting a long time for some money.
c00202 +++$+++ How much?
c00202 +++$+++ Jesus.
c09328 +++$+++ Look at this fellow... or this one.
c09328 +++$+++ Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
c09328 +++$+++ He thinks he looks young.
c09328 +++$+++ What's this country coming to?
c09328 +++$+++ My guess: he's wondering whether to get more fries or go straight to the chocolate sundae.
c13922 +++$+++ Maid's night off?
c13922 +++$+++ Why?
c13922 +++$+++ What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
c13922 +++$+++ I gave everybody the night off.
c13922 +++$+++ Easy, it's an innocent question.
c13922 +++$+++ I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray. Frankly you really saved my a... my neck tonight.
c00596 +++$+++ An interesting idea, Majesty. But -
c00596 +++$+++ Yes?
c00596 +++$+++ You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
c00596 +++$+++ And the result satisfies.
c00596 +++$+++ Yes, of course. My concern is to protect you from any suspicion of favouritism.
c00596 +++$+++ Ah-ha. Favouritism. But I so want Mozart.
c00596 +++$+++ I'm sure there is a way, Majesty. Some kind of a little contest. I could perhaps put together a small Committee, and I could see to it naturally that it will select according to Your Majesty's wishes.
c00596 +++$+++ You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
c00596 +++$+++ Well. There it is.
c16334 +++$+++ The dynamite...
c16334 +++$+++ Dynamite?
c16334 +++$+++ Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
c16334 +++$+++ What does that mean?
c16334 +++$+++ It means it was homemade.
c16334 +++$+++ This is... really a shock...
c16334 +++$+++ Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
c16334 +++$+++ I'll ask the questions, son.
c02890 +++$+++ Are you okay?
c02890 +++$+++ Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The world's my oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my brother's heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don't believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything's hunky-dory.
c02890 +++$+++ Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
c05317 +++$+++ What are you doing up?
c05317 +++$+++ I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
c05317 +++$+++ I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
c05317 +++$+++ That has nothing to do with it.
c05317 +++$+++ Okay.
c12890 +++$+++ It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
c12890 +++$+++ Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
c12890 +++$+++ Sure.
c14488 +++$+++ For a price.
c14488 +++$+++ Good God.
c14488 +++$+++ A small price.
c14488 +++$+++ I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
c14488 +++$+++ And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
c06255 +++$+++ Don't you think I feel lousy about this too?
c06255 +++$+++ All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
c06255 +++$+++ I don't wanna talk about it!
c07631 +++$+++ Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and ...
c07631 +++$+++ I told you, George. I'm not going.
c07631 +++$+++ No I'm not.
c26292 +++$+++ Where you coming from?
c26292 +++$+++ All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
c26292 +++$+++ You've been around.
c26292 +++$+++ I guess I've got wander in my blood.
c26292 +++$+++ Where you headed?
c26292 +++$+++ I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some work there.
c26292 +++$+++ You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
c26292 +++$+++ If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
c26292 +++$+++ What happens if you lose?
c26292 +++$+++ I pack up and go somewhere else.
c26292 +++$+++ I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
c12955 +++$+++ Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
c12955 +++$+++ My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
c12955 +++$+++ A favor?
c12955 +++$+++ Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
c12955 +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry --
c12955 +++$+++ No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
c12955 +++$+++ Are they really?
c12955 +++$+++ Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
c12955 +++$+++ No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
c12955 +++$+++ You're doing everything yourself?
c12955 +++$+++ That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
c23690 +++$+++ So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
c23690 +++$+++ Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
c23690 +++$+++ Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
c23690 +++$+++ You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
c23690 +++$+++ Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
c23690 +++$+++ I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little asshole!
c13791 +++$+++ _ Your father raped someone?
c13791 +++$+++ Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
c13791 +++$+++ Yes.
c13791 +++$+++ I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
c13791 +++$+++ Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
c22542 +++$+++ You don't like the one he was now?
c22542 +++$+++ He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
c22542 +++$+++ She died.
c02777 +++$+++ Don't start, Farmer.
c02777 +++$+++ It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
c02777 +++$+++ The chauffeur. He's watching.
c02777 +++$+++ He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
c02777 +++$+++ I know.
c15094 +++$+++ You could have knocked me down with a feather -- Selectman -- me.
c15094 +++$+++ I'll never get my washing done.
c15094 +++$+++ That's one thing I want to talk to you about, Mary.
c15094 +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Selectman!
c15094 +++$+++ I'm serious.
c15094 +++$+++ It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
c15094 +++$+++ But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
c15094 +++$+++ But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
c15094 +++$+++ Well -- that's the last time -- we'll have servants to do it.
c15094 +++$+++ And I don't want to have a washwoman for a wife.
c21383 +++$+++ The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
c21383 +++$+++ What're you doing here anyway?
c21383 +++$+++ Coffee and a donut.
c21383 +++$+++ Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
c01430 +++$+++ ... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
c01430 +++$+++ I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
c01430 +++$+++ What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
c01430 +++$+++ They say we got to turn around and come right back.  That's what they say.  I got a plan.
c01466 +++$+++ The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model.  Check it out on the Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
c01466 +++$+++ What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
c01466 +++$+++ Garbage man?
c06777 +++$+++ But she still might call!
c06777 +++$+++ Are you coming or not?
c06777 +++$+++ Not a chance!
c00561 +++$+++ What does he look like?
c00561 +++$+++ You might be disappointed.
c00561 +++$+++ Why?
c00561 +++$+++ Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
c20414 +++$+++ The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
c20414 +++$+++ Dear oh dear.
c20414 +++$+++ We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
c20414 +++$+++ Yes.
c20414 +++$+++ Of course.
c26485 +++$+++ Say, Ned... ?
c26485 +++$+++ Yeah.
c26485 +++$+++ How many men you killed?  Ain't you gonna answer?
c26485 +++$+++ I don't like the question.
c26485 +++$+++ Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
c26485 +++$+++ Five. I killed five of 'em.  That counts a Mexican I killed.  He come at me with a knife.
c01369 +++$+++ Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
c01369 +++$+++ No.
c01369 +++$+++ Have you had any before?
c01369 +++$+++ No.
c01369 +++$+++ Not really. Maybe a little.
c12300 +++$+++ I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
c12300 +++$+++ I agree.
c12300 +++$+++ Of course. I would like to look.
c13018 +++$+++ And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
c13018 +++$+++ That's the only angle.
c13018 +++$+++ Hang on...
c06899 +++$+++ Close your eyes.
c06899 +++$+++ Why?
c06899 +++$+++ I've got something for you.
c06899 +++$+++ You ask too many questions. You want the surprise or not?
c23691 +++$+++ Thank God, that sucked ass.
c23691 +++$+++ Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
c23691 +++$+++ The N word?
c23691 +++$+++ Norwegian Ass Raper.
c23691 +++$+++ The rest of you are graduated. You can go home today.
c00490 +++$+++ Do you want to talk about it.
c00490 +++$+++ I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
c00490 +++$+++ No.  I mean your relationship.
c00490 +++$+++ We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
c00490 +++$+++ Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
c00490 +++$+++ People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
c00490 +++$+++ Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
c00490 +++$+++ Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
c00490 +++$+++ I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
c07007 +++$+++ Leon, I would like to ask you something.
c07007 +++$+++ Anything, Ninotchka.
c07007 +++$+++ If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
c07007 +++$+++ I promise... I swear.
c07007 +++$+++ Did you make any change in this room?
c07007 +++$+++ When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?
c18587 +++$+++ I'll need more men to look.
c18587 +++$+++ Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
c18587 +++$+++ I know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  So you better start.
c18613 +++$+++ That's right.
c18613 +++$+++ Who's going to do it?
c18613 +++$+++ Me.
c18613 +++$+++ Michael, you're not going down there.
c18613 +++$+++ I am.  You're not.
c18613 +++$+++ It's a construction job.  I'm the only one that can do it.
c02559 +++$+++ I don't know what happened to Justin.
c02559 +++$+++ I'm telling you, I saw it...
c02559 +++$+++ I know what I saw and it wasn't a fucking "optical effect!"
c01038 +++$+++ Hello?
c01038 +++$+++ Mr. Thomerson.
c01038 +++$+++ Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
c01038 +++$+++ Yes I did.
c01038 +++$+++ Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
c15371 +++$+++ Excuse me, Sir...?
c15371 +++$+++ Yes?
c15371 +++$+++ Uh, uh, I'm a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and I just wanted to meet you.
c15371 +++$+++ My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
c15371 +++$+++ Eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "Don Quixote." So I'm trying to finish a promo for something else.  But I can't find the soundtrack --  I think I left it in Malta.
c04503 +++$+++ I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
c04503 +++$+++ Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
c04503 +++$+++ The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
c04503 +++$+++ And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
c04503 +++$+++ Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.
c16954 +++$+++ What do you want?
c16954 +++$+++ What happened to this car?
c16954 +++$+++ What's it got to do with you?
c16954 +++$+++ This is my brother's car.
c16954 +++$+++ Oh ay?
c16954 +++$+++ Yeah.
c16954 +++$+++ Was the steering faulty?
c21043 +++$+++ Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
c21043 +++$+++ W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
c21043 +++$+++ So long, kid.
c21043 +++$+++ Shhh...
c15848 +++$+++ ... I told you, I'm not hungry.
c15848 +++$+++ Patience.  It's time to eat.
c15848 +++$+++ Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
c15848 +++$+++ It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
c15848 +++$+++ Will it take long to get there? How far away is he?
c15848 +++$+++ Not far, not far.  Be patient. Soon you will see him.  Why wish you become a Jedi?
c15848 +++$+++ Because of my father, I guess.
c15848 +++$+++ How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
c26102 +++$+++ Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
c26102 +++$+++ oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
c26102 +++$+++ Yeah...?
c26102 +++$+++ We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
c26102 +++$+++ I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
c26102 +++$+++ No, no, I'm sure, but -- you understand. It should only be a couple of days. What's the thing you're working on?
c26102 +++$+++ It's called Tron. It's a security program itself, actually. Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems... If it finds anything going on that's not scheduled, it shuts it down. I sent you a memo on it.
c26102 +++$+++ Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
c26102 +++$+++ No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
c26102 +++$+++ Ok
c05474 +++$+++ Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
c05474 +++$+++ Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
c05474 +++$+++ Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
c05474 +++$+++ Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
c15214 +++$+++ Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
c15214 +++$+++ One has nuthin' to do with the other.
c15214 +++$+++ Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
c15214 +++$+++ I'm getting paid...
c15214 +++$+++ ...peanuts.
c15214 +++$+++ I truly hope so.  I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
c26553 +++$+++ Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
c26553 +++$+++ Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
c26553 +++$+++ It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
c22152 +++$+++ Hear she's retarded.
c22152 +++$+++ She ain't retarded, she's shy.
c22152 +++$+++ Does that bum have to say that?
c06491 +++$+++ I'm so sorry, Stu. I <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. I really, really liked you.
c06491 +++$+++ Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
c06491 +++$+++ Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
c01107 +++$+++ Look, it isn't proof, okay? Someone may have put the chemical in the outlet, but we found it as a vapor in Cosgrove's clothes.
c01107 +++$+++ And the putty around the door?
c01107 +++$+++ Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
c01107 +++$+++ But the right guess on this is arson.
c01107 +++$+++ I don't guess.
c01107 +++$+++ I don't work for them, either.
c22281 +++$+++ He sees this differently, as you well know.
c22281 +++$+++ I didn't expect that he would.
c22281 +++$+++ You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
c22281 +++$+++ Not a word.  But no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do.  And so I place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me.  You work for some government agency and you carry a gun, and in my world, that makes you a cop.
c17794 +++$+++ In and out.  Yes.  And Mama... and Mama, is not your real Mama, is she Franklin?
c17794 +++$+++ She my foster.
c17794 +++$+++ She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
c17794 +++$+++ No.
c17794 +++$+++ Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
c17794 +++$+++ We got KittyKat...
c17794 +++$+++ Yes.... yes...
c17794 +++$+++ ...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
c17794 +++$+++ Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
c17794 +++$+++ The government says.  Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.  The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  You can't see Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty Cat.  That's what the <u>Government</u> says...
c21683 +++$+++ Friends of yours, huh?
c21683 +++$+++ The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
c21683 +++$+++ What's their program?
c21683 +++$+++ They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
c21683 +++$+++ You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
c21683 +++$+++ No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
c21683 +++$+++ De nada.
c00319 +++$+++ So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
c00319 +++$+++ No.
c00319 +++$+++ She just seemed... depressed... ?
c00319 +++$+++ She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
c00319 +++$+++ What was she running from?
c00319 +++$+++ I don't know.
c00319 +++$+++ If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
c00319 +++$+++ Yes.
c00319 +++$+++ September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
c00319 +++$+++ We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
c00319 +++$+++ Why do you think he did it?
c00319 +++$+++ It got to be too much for him.
c00319 +++$+++ You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
c00319 +++$+++ There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
c00319 +++$+++ I didn't mean to...
c00319 +++$+++ You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
c00319 +++$+++ No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
c18471 +++$+++ It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
c18471 +++$+++ In the morning -- go. I'll not die until then --- I'll not die ---- I'll watch --- they shall not hurt you.
c18471 +++$+++ They shall not hurt you
c00054 +++$+++ How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
c00054 +++$+++ It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
c00054 +++$+++ It's just something I had.  You know
c00054 +++$+++ Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
c04372 +++$+++ Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
c04372 +++$+++ Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
c04372 +++$+++ I asked around.
c13069 +++$+++ Damn! Blast!
c13069 +++$+++ What's the matter?
c13069 +++$+++ You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
c13069 +++$+++ All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
c13069 +++$+++ All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
c13910 +++$+++ Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
c13910 +++$+++ ...Just a minute...
c13910 +++$+++ Oh... thank you.
c12892 +++$+++ Okay.
c12892 +++$+++ What's her name?
c12892 +++$+++ Betty.
c12892 +++$+++ Okay.
c10743 +++$+++ So. How are you adjusting?
c10743 +++$+++ I'm adjusting okay.
c10743 +++$+++ And your new apartment?
c10743 +++$+++ Apartment's okay.
c10743 +++$+++ Are you taking your medication?
c10743 +++$+++ It gives me headaches.
c10743 +++$+++ Yeah.
c07843 +++$+++ They came to me with an offer. 800,000 for the negative and all the prints.
c07843 +++$+++ And they went to the stockholders in New York.
c07843 +++$+++ I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
c10802 +++$+++ Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
c10802 +++$+++ What's the plan?
c10802 +++$+++ WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
c19411 +++$+++ How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
c19411 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c19411 +++$+++ One moment, please.
c15274 +++$+++ You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
c15274 +++$+++ How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
c15274 +++$+++ But my mom gave me the map.
c15274 +++$+++ I lugged it all over town!
c15274 +++$+++ I made the polar bear pants.
c15274 +++$+++ But I ate your Mom's pie.
c15274 +++$+++ It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
c09902 +++$+++ The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
c09902 +++$+++ That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
c09902 +++$+++ She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
c09902 +++$+++ No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
c09926 +++$+++ I am the oldest.
c09926 +++$+++ No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
c09926 +++$+++ My father has gone to a better place.
c09926 +++$+++ Of course.  You're just tired. Mara, will you look after Alexander tonight?
c09245 +++$+++ Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams.
c09245 +++$+++ Leave him alone, Tran.
c09245 +++$+++ He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
c09245 +++$+++ Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale.
c07787 +++$+++ A kiss for each page.
c07787 +++$+++ Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
c07787 +++$+++ Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
c04574 +++$+++ Joe.
c04574 +++$+++ What?
c04574 +++$+++ Oh yeah, thanks...
c12164 +++$+++ But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --
c12164 +++$+++ I'll take you home if you'd like.
c12164 +++$+++ God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
c12164 +++$+++ ... We could try that.
c14921 +++$+++ What happened? Were you kicked out?
c14921 +++$+++ No.
c14921 +++$+++ I'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
c06204 +++$+++ He has to go, Samuel.
c06204 +++$+++ What? Who?
c06204 +++$+++ Creasy.
c06204 +++$+++ Why? You were so pleased with him.
c06204 +++$+++ Pinta likes him too much.  She thinks of him as a father.
c06204 +++$+++ It's not.
c21445 +++$+++ Do you need a break?
c21445 +++$+++ No.
c21445 +++$+++ While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
c21445 +++$+++ That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
c21445 +++$+++ Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
c21445 +++$+++ Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
c19716 +++$+++ Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
c19716 +++$+++ No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
c19716 +++$+++ My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
c19716 +++$+++ I have work to do at the plant.
c19716 +++$+++ I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
c12902 +++$+++ Maybe I oughtta get there a little early. For good luck.
c12902 +++$+++ Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
c12902 +++$+++ Let me see your hand.
c12902 +++$+++ All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
c12902 +++$+++ Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
c07886 +++$+++ Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
c07886 +++$+++ What?
c07886 +++$+++ You asleep?
c07886 +++$+++ Yeah.
c07886 +++$+++ Huh?
c07886 +++$+++ Yeah, what?
c07886 +++$+++ Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
c07886 +++$+++ Nobody. I love you, remember?
c07886 +++$+++ Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
c07886 +++$+++ What did I say?
c07886 +++$+++ That he's got a pretty face.
c07886 +++$+++ I never noticed his face.
c07886 +++$+++ You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
c07886 +++$+++ You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want.
c05942 +++$+++ -- but he didn't.
c05942 +++$+++ Then who was he?
c05942 +++$+++ Just some guy... they found.
c05942 +++$+++ Somewhere.
c07165 +++$+++ Yessir?
c07165 +++$+++ I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
c07165 +++$+++ Did you go up to his trailer?
c07165 +++$+++ Yes I did.
c07165 +++$+++ Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
c07165 +++$+++ Where does he work?
c07165 +++$+++ I can't say.
c07165 +++$+++ Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.
c03385 +++$+++ I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
c03385 +++$+++ No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
c03385 +++$+++ He's listed on the blueprints as I. Shandor.
c18513 +++$+++ Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
c18513 +++$+++ I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
c18513 +++$+++ Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
c18513 +++$+++ Oh . . .
c18513 +++$+++ I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
c18513 +++$+++ Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess.
c25919 +++$+++ He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
c25919 +++$+++ I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
c25919 +++$+++ I'm almost finished. I'm about to come to the punch line.
c25919 +++$+++ I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
c25919 +++$+++ But these are white people, anybody. The punch...
c25919 +++$+++ It's only a tale.
c05183 +++$+++ What?!
c05183 +++$+++ Either I just pissed my pants or...
c05183 +++$+++ Thundercats are go!
c17861 +++$+++ "You might think what I've done is shocking..."
c17861 +++$+++ "To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
c17861 +++$+++ That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
c17861 +++$+++ This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
c17861 +++$+++ She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
c17861 +++$+++ That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
c17861 +++$+++ You're probably right..."People think just because you're beautiful and popular, life is easy and fun. Nobody understood I had feelings too."
c17861 +++$+++ That's good. Have you done this before?
c20181 +++$+++ Sean, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about... Isn't going to be easy for me to say.
c20181 +++$+++ Then don't say it.
c20181 +++$+++ I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
c20181 +++$+++ To do what?
c20181 +++$+++ Sort it all out.
c20181 +++$+++ And you're going to have time.  There's been a change of plans.
c20181 +++$+++ A change of plans?
c20181 +++$+++ Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
c20181 +++$+++ Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
c20181 +++$+++ Lovely.
c01254 +++$+++ I don't know... I like the Army.
c01254 +++$+++ C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
c01254 +++$+++ Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
c08907 +++$+++ There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
c08907 +++$+++ We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
c08907 +++$+++ Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
c08907 +++$+++ You want me to contact Starfleet?
c08907 +++$+++ Is there a problem?
c08907 +++$+++ Thank you, Number One.
c26100 +++$+++ What for?
c26100 +++$+++ To warn him.
c26100 +++$+++ That Dillinger's on to him.
c20704 +++$+++ You know anything about the stations here?
c20704 +++$+++ It's hard to say. Doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. All it was was appendix.
c20704 +++$+++ Did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
c26843 +++$+++ You can't have a war without an enemy.
c26843 +++$+++ No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
c26843 +++$+++ Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
c26843 +++$+++ Ten Days.  There going to be any Back End in this thing?
c26843 +++$+++ W...what?
c26843 +++$+++ ...there gonna be any money in this thing?
c26843 +++$+++ Lots n lotsa cash.  Stay on for Gracie, she'll get you a ticket
c05964 +++$+++ The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.
c05964 +++$+++ You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
c05964 +++$+++ Then why can't they see rapes, or assaults... or suicides?
c20852 +++$+++ Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
c20852 +++$+++ Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
c20852 +++$+++ Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
c19740 +++$+++ Have you ever omitted telling me. things before?
c19740 +++$+++ No.
c19740 +++$+++ Then why?
c19740 +++$+++ I wanted it over fast.  It felt dirty to not tell you.
c19740 +++$+++ Can you quit?
c19740 +++$+++ No.
c19740 +++$+++ Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
c20217 +++$+++ Only four more cars.
c20217 +++$+++ And if we donit find him - weill search the whole train again.
c20217 +++$+++ Whatis Hunt doing on the TGV?
c20217 +++$+++ High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
c20217 +++$+++ But why tell us?
c20217 +++$+++ Heis putting on a show, Barnes.
c20217 +++$+++ I donit know.  It didnit say on the tickets.
c00041 +++$+++ This is so patronizing.
c00041 +++$+++ Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
c00041 +++$+++ Why 're you doing this?
c00041 +++$+++ I told you
c00041 +++$+++ You don't care if I die
c00041 +++$+++ Sure, I do
c00041 +++$+++ Why?
c00041 +++$+++ Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
c00041 +++$+++ Like you could find one
c00041 +++$+++ Just let me sit down.
c26614 +++$+++ Just let me talk to you.
c26614 +++$+++ What about?
c26614 +++$+++ Why?
c13249 +++$+++ Buffy, honey?
c13249 +++$+++ Yeah?
c13249 +++$+++ Have you gained a few pounds?  Maybe it's that outfit...
c13249 +++$+++ Maybe.
c13249 +++$+++ What's Bobby gonna say?
c13249 +++$+++ Aren't we the chatty ones.  Kiss noise.
c24854 +++$+++ Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
c24854 +++$+++ Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
c24854 +++$+++ Who'd you butcher at the house?
c24854 +++$+++ Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
c24854 +++$+++ Huh?
c24854 +++$+++ He's brought in the heavy mob.
c24854 +++$+++ What?
c24854 +++$+++ Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
c24854 +++$+++ They look a right load of wallies. Patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' Household Cavalry.  Watch it.
c25374 +++$+++ Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
c25374 +++$+++ Yes... they were.
c25374 +++$+++ Good.  Where are the English?
c25374 +++$+++ Everywhere.  Where is the food?
c25374 +++$+++ It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
c25374 +++$+++ I know...
c25374 +++$+++ He's on the other side of the river.
c12328 +++$+++ ... Gentlemen, I quoted this man on national television today he is obviously a financial sophisticate of some reknown.
c12328 +++$+++ Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
c12328 +++$+++ He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
c12328 +++$+++ Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
c12328 +++$+++ Right, Chief.
c20617 +++$+++ I found this.
c20617 +++$+++ I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
c20617 +++$+++ In the garage.
c20617 +++$+++ Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
c20617 +++$+++ What was my mama like?
c20617 +++$+++ She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
c20617 +++$+++ Really?
c20617 +++$+++ Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
c20617 +++$+++ Do you miss her?
c20617 +++$+++ Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
c20617 +++$+++ That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me.  Seeya in the morning.
c01937 +++$+++ Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
c01937 +++$+++ Yes.
c01937 +++$+++ I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
c01937 +++$+++ Yes. What is it you want?
c01937 +++$+++ Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
c01937 +++$+++ I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
c24565 +++$+++ Ally Jones.
c24565 +++$+++ How is Mrs. Stephens?
c24565 +++$+++ We're...not together.
c24565 +++$+++ I'd heard that.  But she's well?
c24565 +++$+++ And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
c15234 +++$+++ Where are you going?
c15234 +++$+++ To get my money.
c15234 +++$+++ Tina, it's not like that.
c05620 +++$+++ The whole summer, man.  Party in Tahoe.
c05620 +++$+++ I don't know.
c05620 +++$+++ It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
c05620 +++$+++ Hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
c19601 +++$+++ Thirty fuckin' years I've been with Rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and I know what you think --
c19601 +++$+++ All your other fluzzies?
c19601 +++$+++ Yeah. Yes.
c19601 +++$+++ You're making me feel so dirty and shitty. I feel like a big piece of shit right now.
c19601 +++$+++ Are you gonna tell her what you've done?
c19601 +++$+++ Yes.
c19601 +++$+++ Will you say my name?
c19601 +++$+++ Well can you do me one favor and don't do that.
c02800 +++$+++ You're on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
c02800 +++$+++ That's fine with me...  Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
c02800 +++$+++ Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
c02800 +++$+++ Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --
c12663 +++$+++ Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
c12663 +++$+++ Oh yeah?
c12663 +++$+++ Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
c12663 +++$+++ Jeffrey!!
c12663 +++$+++ Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
c12663 +++$+++ I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
c12663 +++$+++ Yeah.
c12663 +++$+++ Jeffrey?. Why?
c12663 +++$+++ I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. and it's all secret.
c12663 +++$+++ Yeah. you're a mystery. I like you. very much.
c19256 +++$+++ Whole different story; isn't it?
c19256 +++$+++ You're fired. You're outta the department.
c19256 +++$+++ There's not a soul in this county isn't sick to death of your bullshit, Charley. You made yourself scarce, you could make a lot of people happy.
c19256 +++$+++ Now or later, Charley. You won't have any trouble finding me.
c20724 +++$+++ My mother. died in '72. They told me after. They said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.
c20724 +++$+++ What?
c20724 +++$+++ I'm sorry but I have to go.
c24162 +++$+++ Well Filmore--
c24162 +++$+++ Well Cooper...
c24162 +++$+++ I guess not Cooper...
c11269 +++$+++ You are the boy ...
c11269 +++$+++ I should go
c11269 +++$+++ That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
c11269 +++$+++ Promise me she'll have her home.
c11269 +++$+++ She does.
c11269 +++$+++ Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
c16696 +++$+++ That was over thirty years ago.  I paid for that and then some.
c16696 +++$+++ You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
c16696 +++$+++ Yeah.
c16696 +++$+++ You remember Mary Finelli?
c16696 +++$+++ What are you saying?
c16696 +++$+++ You know what I'm saying.
c16696 +++$+++ Well, I think you do.
c23635 +++$+++ I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
c23635 +++$+++ You don't live around here, do you?
c23635 +++$+++ No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
c23635 +++$+++ Is he here in Borderdale?
c23635 +++$+++ Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
c17215 +++$+++ You okay?
c17215 +++$+++ Oh Clayton.
c17215 +++$+++ Did I hurt you?
c17215 +++$+++ Nothing I didn't deserve.
c17215 +++$+++ Pray you, undo this button.
c26945 +++$+++ Well maybe your wife...
c26945 +++$+++ She isn't here.
c26945 +++$+++ When...when will she be back?
c26945 +++$+++ I don't know.
c26945 +++$+++ I have to go.
c11481 +++$+++ You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
c11481 +++$+++ I can't think of any.
c11481 +++$+++ Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
c11481 +++$+++ Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
c11481 +++$+++ Maybe I'll get lucky.  You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
c06663 +++$+++ Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
c06663 +++$+++ You're Walter, aren't you?
c06663 +++$+++ I just wanted to make sure.
c17825 +++$+++ It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
c17825 +++$+++ Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
c17825 +++$+++ Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
c17825 +++$+++ Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
c17825 +++$+++ But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
c17825 +++$+++ And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
c17825 +++$+++ That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
c17825 +++$+++ Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
c01898 +++$+++ Yes, I come.
c01898 +++$+++ I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
c01898 +++$+++ But Sacha always puts out that light --
c01898 +++$+++ Yes, I come, I will do it.
c02055 +++$+++ We had to finalize the deal.
c02055 +++$+++ Everything looks in order.
c02055 +++$+++ This has to happen fast.
c02055 +++$+++ There'll be red flags.
c23897 +++$+++ I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
c23897 +++$+++ I know that.
c23897 +++$+++ You saw through me?
c23897 +++$+++ You could put it that way.
c23897 +++$+++ I assure you my intentions weren't bad.
c23897 +++$+++ My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
c24689 +++$+++ The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
c24689 +++$+++ Why him?
c24689 +++$+++ Then what?
c15348 +++$+++ No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
c15348 +++$+++ Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
c15348 +++$+++ So did you get his autograph?
c16495 +++$+++ Excuse me...
c16495 +++$+++ Listen, I'm not feeling well.
c16495 +++$+++ Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
c16495 +++$+++ Listen, you're very nice... b...
c16495 +++$+++ So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I'm not coming up to your apartment.  That was never my idea.
c16495 +++$+++ Oh... You mean you don't want to.
c16495 +++$+++ Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
c16495 +++$+++ You're married.
c16495 +++$+++ No.
c16495 +++$+++ Divorced.
c16495 +++$+++ No, I...
c16495 +++$+++ Will you stop!...  ... I'm in love with you...
c07178 +++$+++ This was my wife's father's place. Originally.
c07178 +++$+++ You married into it.
c07178 +++$+++ We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago.
c07178 +++$+++ You married into it.
c07178 +++$+++ I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
c16399 +++$+++ Why... why... why... ?
c16399 +++$+++ Why what?
c16399 +++$+++ Why can't I get rid of you?  Why can't I just wish you away?
c16399 +++$+++ You need me.
c16399 +++$+++ No, no, I don't.  I thank you, I really do.  Thank you, but I don't need you anymore.
c16399 +++$+++ Noooo, please...
c04215 +++$+++ I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
c04215 +++$+++ You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
c04215 +++$+++ Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
c04215 +++$+++ What are your beliefs, Earl?
c04215 +++$+++ They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
c04215 +++$+++ How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
c04215 +++$+++ I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
c04215 +++$+++ "Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
c04215 +++$+++ Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
c12228 +++$+++ Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate these people.
c12228 +++$+++ They make gypsies look good.
c12228 +++$+++ Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
c12228 +++$+++ We're not completely helpless. I've been reading the book. There's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
c25624 +++$+++ Jaeger?
c25624 +++$+++ What?
c25624 +++$+++ You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
c25624 +++$+++ Yeah.  So?
c25624 +++$+++ That's in two days.
c25624 +++$+++ Like I said; so?
c25624 +++$+++ They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
c25624 +++$+++ What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
c25624 +++$+++ We're going to war, aren't we.  If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
c25624 +++$+++ Why would they do all that if we weren't?
c19318 +++$+++ How long have you lived here?
c19318 +++$+++ Two years.
c19318 +++$+++ There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
c19318 +++$+++ Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
c19318 +++$+++ I've felt that way, yeah.
c23071 +++$+++ That's it, then.
c23071 +++$+++ That's all?
c23071 +++$+++ Sorry to waste your time.
c23071 +++$+++ Oh, no problems. Don't worry.
c23071 +++$+++ Yes.
c27398 +++$+++ Where did you get this cauliflower?
c27398 +++$+++ From your office, sir.
c27398 +++$+++ Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
c27398 +++$+++ Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
c24058 +++$+++ I have to tell you, I can not <u>express</u> to you how <u>happy</u>...
c24058 +++$+++ And we're glad to have you here...
c24058 +++$+++ My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
c24058 +++$+++ Why would they be illegal?
c23192 +++$+++ I don't want to fight, George.
c23192 +++$+++ I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
c23192 +++$+++ I do, Jill.
c24583 +++$+++ I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
c24583 +++$+++ Do they have any reputation for drugs?
c24583 +++$+++ No, nothing like that.  The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions  in a respectful way.  They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
c24583 +++$+++ Oh yes.  Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school.  It's like he was their little treasure.  He was such a beautiful boy.  That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott.
c05539 +++$+++ Someone worthy of respect, lad.  She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side.  Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
c05539 +++$+++ How is it this hag knows the truth?
c05539 +++$+++ Think there be truth only in beauty, lad?  If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
c05539 +++$+++ Aye.  On the morrow we go, but tonight...  ... tonight is for making merry.
c01920 +++$+++ No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
c01920 +++$+++ -- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
c01920 +++$+++ -- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
c15400 +++$+++ How's your mother?
c15400 +++$+++ Al!
c15400 +++$+++ Our neighbors gave me a ride.
c15400 +++$+++ Where is she? Is she all right?
c24696 +++$+++ Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
c24696 +++$+++ For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
c24696 +++$+++ I'm very sorry.
c24696 +++$+++ I'm Steve. What's your name?
c24696 +++$+++ David. David Wills. I'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee. Sir.
c24696 +++$+++ Sounds a lot of run.  So they sent the big guns to check up on me. We recruiting children now?
c24696 +++$+++ You call me sir again and I'll make you listen to Beethoven.
c11716 +++$+++ Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
c11716 +++$+++ I ain't scared of you.
c11716 +++$+++ Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
c11716 +++$+++ All right, Bain.  Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
c12922 +++$+++ You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
c12922 +++$+++ Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
c12922 +++$+++ I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
c12922 +++$+++ And you?  Still a pig.  Just a much fatter one.
c12922 +++$+++ No reason to get nasty.  Yeah, I've stayed in the organization.  But then again I never got the percentage you did.
c12922 +++$+++ Or you didn't know what to do with it.
c12922 +++$+++ Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
c12922 +++$+++ What building?
c12922 +++$+++ Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
c12922 +++$+++ Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
c01044 +++$+++ God, you're a slob.
c01044 +++$+++ But a fabulous cook.
c01044 +++$+++ What are we having?
c01044 +++$+++ I think your dinner's burning.
c25614 +++$+++ Epps.
c25614 +++$+++ Yeah.
c25614 +++$+++ I want you to know... I don't know.  I just think you're a hell of a guy.
c25614 +++$+++ Thanks.
c25614 +++$+++ This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
c25614 +++$+++ Threatened to blow my brains out?
c25614 +++$+++ Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.
c26497 +++$+++ We've met once or twice. Last time was in...
c26497 +++$+++ County. I was in for fraud.
c26497 +++$+++ I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
c03047 +++$+++ Congress is bitterly opposed to allowing Negroes in the army!
c03047 +++$+++ We already have black soldiers in our army...
c03047 +++$+++ What's the difference?
c19392 +++$+++ Did I scowl at you?
c19392 +++$+++ No, you smiled.
c19392 +++$+++ I know, I kind of blend in here.
c10513 +++$+++ Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
c10513 +++$+++ Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
c10513 +++$+++ Give me some time to blow the man down...
c08974 +++$+++ They destroyed the simulator room and you with it.
c08974 +++$+++ The <u>Kobayshi Maru</u> scenario frequently wreaks havoc with students and equipment.  As I recall you took the test three times yourself. Your final solution was, shall we say, unique?
c08974 +++$+++ It had the virtue of never having been tried.
c08974 +++$+++ Yours was not a solution which would have occurred to a Vulcan mentality.
c08974 +++$+++ So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot,g,'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
c08974 +++$+++ Than you. Yes, I see that. By the way, thank you for this.
c19985 +++$+++ Hiya.
c19985 +++$+++ I'm Mr. Shelby from 304.
c19985 +++$+++ What can I do for you, Leonard?
c19985 +++$+++ I'm sorry... um... ?
c19985 +++$+++ Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls -  MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99
c13216 +++$+++ What's up, Walter?
c13216 +++$+++ I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
c13216 +++$+++ Yeah.  Can some of you guys help me?
c06322 +++$+++ How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
c06322 +++$+++ Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
c06322 +++$+++ Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
c22314 +++$+++ We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
c22314 +++$+++ Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
c22314 +++$+++ Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
c22314 +++$+++ It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
c22314 +++$+++ I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
c22314 +++$+++ Because...I know.
c01987 +++$+++ Four four.  A record.
c01987 +++$+++ You don't seem too happy about it.
c01987 +++$+++ Let me guess, Russia came up?
c17893 +++$+++ Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa?
c17893 +++$+++ Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or...
c17893 +++$+++ That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on.
c17893 +++$+++ No wisdom, no insight, no plan.
c18057 +++$+++ That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
c18057 +++$+++ Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
c18057 +++$+++ You're being stupid.  Check out the bathroom.  Maybe we can sneak out a window --
c00253 +++$+++ Finished what?
c00253 +++$+++ Learning language.
c00253 +++$+++ All 900.
c11724 +++$+++ You're one of them, aren't you?
c11724 +++$+++ 'Them'?
c11724 +++$+++ An assassin?
c11724 +++$+++ Until a minute ago.
c11724 +++$+++ If I still was what I used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
c02666 +++$+++ Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
c02666 +++$+++ Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
c02666 +++$+++ Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
c02666 +++$+++ You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
c02666 +++$+++ All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
c02666 +++$+++ Climax together.
c02666 +++$+++ Does that ever happen?
c02666 +++$+++ Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'
c01563 +++$+++ Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
c01563 +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
c01563 +++$+++ Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
c04642 +++$+++ How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
c04642 +++$+++ Oh, lots.
c04642 +++$+++ Yeah, that's right.
c04642 +++$+++ But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
c04642 +++$+++ I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
c04642 +++$+++ I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
c04642 +++$+++ Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
c04642 +++$+++ Oh, please, Mike...
c04642 +++$+++ Give me a break!
c04642 +++$+++ No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
c04642 +++$+++ In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
c04642 +++$+++ I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS. I'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. Now, what do you think you think about then? The future? "In the future I'm going to do this? Become that?"  What "future"? No. What you think is: how will I be regarded in the end? After I'm gone.
c00818 +++$+++ Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
c00818 +++$+++ Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
c00818 +++$+++ Good.
c00818 +++$+++ Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
c00818 +++$+++ Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
c00818 +++$+++ Yes sir.
c00818 +++$+++ Just perfect.
c00818 +++$+++ A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
c00818 +++$+++ You see the Army leaving and you see the loss of a tool. I see a power void to be filled. As we have the most power, we may move with impunity.
c00818 +++$+++ I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
c12047 +++$+++ ... What's the matter?
c12047 +++$+++ Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
c12047 +++$+++ You're back.
c12047 +++$+++ It's Monday morning.
c12047 +++$+++ It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
c12047 +++$+++ You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
c12047 +++$+++ Basquiat, what did you take?
c14272 +++$+++ What took so long?  You were in there all day.
c14272 +++$+++ That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
c14272 +++$+++ Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
c14272 +++$+++ Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
c14272 +++$+++ If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
c14272 +++$+++ Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
c14272 +++$+++ Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
c14272 +++$+++ Change lanes.  Then watch your rearview.
c15452 +++$+++ Ray, maybe this isn't ...
c15452 +++$+++ No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
c15452 +++$+++ Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
c21543 +++$+++ Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.
c21543 +++$+++ Why not?
c21543 +++$+++ Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
c07065 +++$+++ We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
c07065 +++$+++ That fruitcake!  What about him?
c07065 +++$+++ Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
c07065 +++$+++ Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico.  The FBI's onto it.  We could have a problem with that.
c24956 +++$+++ Like the claw.
c24956 +++$+++ Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
c24956 +++$+++ Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
c15108 +++$+++ What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
c15108 +++$+++ Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
c15108 +++$+++ Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
c15108 +++$+++ Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
c15108 +++$+++ Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --
c13590 +++$+++ Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
c13590 +++$+++ In your dreams.
c13590 +++$+++ Are you busting my chops or what?
c21923 +++$+++ Mary is Lila's sister?
c21923 +++$+++ Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
c21923 +++$+++ Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
c21923 +++$+++ He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates...
c21923 +++$+++ No. An old woman, his mother.  That was early this evening. And we haven't seen or heard from him since. I went out to the motel, just got back. No one was in the office, and...
c01875 +++$+++ Actually, Kayleigh, the reason I came back to town was to talk to you.
c01875 +++$+++ Me? Are you kidding? Why?
c01875 +++$+++ Remember when I was a kid I had all these blackouts?
c01875 +++$+++ Of course.
c01875 +++$+++ Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
c01875 +++$+++ Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
c01875 +++$+++ When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
c01875 +++$+++ What do you want to know, Evan?
c01875 +++$+++ It's just... did he... what happened in the basement?
c01875 +++$+++ It was a long time ago.
c01875 +++$+++ I know, but...
c01875 +++$+++ No, but I think something really bad might've happened to us.
c21470 +++$+++ <u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.
c21470 +++$+++ So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
c21470 +++$+++ I <u>know</u> the difference. That doesn't mean I'm always able to recognize the difference.
c21470 +++$+++ I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.
c26208 +++$+++ I'm really not very -
c26208 +++$+++ You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
c26208 +++$+++ You don't know the chicken places around where you live?  Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
c04588 +++$+++ You know where he went?
c04588 +++$+++ What's he done?
c04588 +++$+++ He stole something. From a friend of mine.
c04588 +++$+++ He must be a good friend.
c04588 +++$+++ We're very close.
c04588 +++$+++ What'd he steal?
c04588 +++$+++ A chip. Goes in a computer.
c04588 +++$+++ One chip?
c04588 +++$+++ The most important one. Can you help me find him?
c04588 +++$+++ Got to trust someone.
c19744 +++$+++ Thanks for the lift.
c19744 +++$+++ I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
c19744 +++$+++ That's right.
c19744 +++$+++ Thanks.
c21093 +++$+++ Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
c21093 +++$+++ Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
c21093 +++$+++ Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
c21093 +++$+++ Please, Larry.  I have to hurry.
c11371 +++$+++ Oh.
c11371 +++$+++ Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
c11371 +++$+++ Well, hi!
c11371 +++$+++ Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
c11371 +++$+++ Oh, yeah, really, oh!
c11371 +++$+++ I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
c11371 +++$+++ Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
c11371 +++$+++ Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
c11371 +++$+++ Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
c07375 +++$+++ Too many stairs.
c07375 +++$+++ Got us in here, didn't I?
c07375 +++$+++ Shoulda got an apartment.
c07375 +++$+++ 478-0150.
c03326 +++$+++ I'm Jack Hardemeyer.  I'm the mayor's assistant. What can I do for you?
c03326 +++$+++ I'm an old friend of the mayor's.  I just want to say hello to him.
c03326 +++$+++ I know who you are, Doctor Venkman.  Busting any ghosts lately?
c03326 +++$+++ Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You read me?
c03049 +++$+++ But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
c03049 +++$+++ They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
c03049 +++$+++ George, I'm afraid if you go through with this madness I must tender my resignation as your aide. I see where we're headed, you're putting your trust in the likes of Hamilton and Arnold...
c03049 +++$+++ How many generals do we have like Arnold?  He's got guts -- he's vain, and he fights!
c03049 +++$+++ And, Hamilton?  Greene?
c03049 +++$+++ They help me understand why we fight.
c03049 +++$+++ Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
c21158 +++$+++ This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
c21158 +++$+++ I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
c21158 +++$+++ I wish I knew.
c21158 +++$+++ So do I, Charley. For your sake.
c21158 +++$+++ What do you want me to do, Johnny?
c21158 +++$+++ Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
c21158 +++$+++ Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
c21158 +++$+++ Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
c21158 +++$+++ Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
c21158 +++$+++ Then don't.
c21158 +++$+++ This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way.  But you can't have it both ways.  Am I right, Sonny?
c23569 +++$+++ If there is one thing I admire, it's a girl with a shapely ankle.
c23569 +++$+++ Me too.  Bye now.
c23569 +++$+++ Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
c21130 +++$+++ So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
c21130 +++$+++ I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
c21130 +++$+++ You think he misses me at all?
c21130 +++$+++ You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
c09180 +++$+++ This is a mistake.
c09180 +++$+++ He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
c09180 +++$+++ My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
c03535 +++$+++ Grusinskaya --
c03535 +++$+++ Yes.
c03535 +++$+++ You do believe that I really love you?
c03535 +++$+++ Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
c03535 +++$+++ I want to be good to you -- madly good.
c03535 +++$+++ Suzette will be back here in a minute.
c03535 +++$+++ I'll go -- good-bye.
c03535 +++$+++ I --
c24570 +++$+++ My name is...
c24570 +++$+++ Mister, I don't want to know your name.
c24570 +++$+++ No you don't.
c19172 +++$+++ My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
c19172 +++$+++ Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
c19172 +++$+++ My son Magua's pain is my pain.
c19172 +++$+++ Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
c19172 +++$+++ Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
c03398 +++$+++ I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
c03398 +++$+++ Sneaking around with your brother?
c03398 +++$+++ Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
c03398 +++$+++ I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
c03398 +++$+++ Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
c03398 +++$+++ Why do you play at being drunk?
c03398 +++$+++ How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
c03398 +++$+++ Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it?  The Emperor himself, didn't you know?  Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front?  Burning patriotism? Filial love?  He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor.  Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
c01754 +++$+++ Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
c01754 +++$+++ I don't know about that.
c01754 +++$+++ Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
c01754 +++$+++ The one and only Little Richard.
c16889 +++$+++ What makes them think that?
c16889 +++$+++ They found my eyelash.
c16889 +++$+++ Where?
c16889 +++$+++ Could be worse.  They could have found it in your eye.
c22865 +++$+++ It just occurred to me that I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
c22865 +++$+++ Now that it's out of your system.
c22865 +++$+++ And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
c22865 +++$+++ Oh it did?
c22865 +++$+++ Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
c22865 +++$+++ No, no. I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule. I just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff.
c23167 +++$+++ God, there's Lester...
c23167 +++$+++ Don't go, Jackie...
c23167 +++$+++ I can't just let him stand by the door...
c23167 +++$+++ Don't leave me...
c23167 +++$+++ I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
c23167 +++$+++ I don't know -- I've got to.
c04339 +++$+++ Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
c04339 +++$+++ It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
c04339 +++$+++ I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing.
c04339 +++$+++ Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
c04339 +++$+++ Got it.
c22687 +++$+++ I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.
c22687 +++$+++ What if our guys open up, sir?
c22687 +++$+++ Have it your way, Captain.
c14099 +++$+++ Do I know you?
c14099 +++$+++ You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
c14099 +++$+++ Caitlin Bree. Yeah?
c14099 +++$+++ I'm her sister.
c14099 +++$+++ Yep. I remember you got caught in my parents' room with Caitlin once.
c15126 +++$+++ Go on.
c15126 +++$+++ We have a pregnant woman out there --  -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
c15126 +++$+++ No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
c15126 +++$+++ Yes, you're right.  It will be done.
c10893 +++$+++ And you had a sister who died in the convent.
c10893 +++$+++ Who told you this?
c10893 +++$+++ Do you still go to church?
c10893 +++$+++ What business is it of yours..?
c10893 +++$+++ Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
c10893 +++$+++ Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
c10893 +++$+++ But what you believe makes no difference to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does make all the difference to Agnes.
c10893 +++$+++ Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me.
c21571 +++$+++ They'll know whether he killed himself.
c21571 +++$+++ I don't.
c21571 +++$+++ How did you meet him?
c21571 +++$+++ On a train. He said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
c21571 +++$+++ Nice of him.
c21571 +++$+++ He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
c21571 +++$+++ That's all there is.
c04133 +++$+++ Do you know what this is?
c04133 +++$+++ I presume it's a sword.
c04133 +++$+++ A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
c04133 +++$+++ Your murder weapon?
c04133 +++$+++ It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
c04133 +++$+++ For the moment.
c19582 +++$+++ Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?
c19582 +++$+++ No.
c19582 +++$+++ ...Lily...?
c19582 +++$+++ No.
c19582 +++$+++ She's my love...my life...love of it... In school when you're 12 years old. In school, in six grade....and I saw her and I didn't go to that school...but we met. And my friend knew her...I would say, "What's that girl?"  "How's that Lily?" "Oh, she's a bad girl...she sleeps with guys..."  My friend would say this....but then sometime...I went to another school, you see? But then...when high school at the end, what's that?  What is that?  When you get to the end?
c19582 +++$+++ Graduation?
c19582 +++$+++ No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
c19582 +++$+++ Yeah...So I go to her school for that for grade twelve...and we meet...she was fuckin...like a doll...porcelain doll...and the hips...child bearing hips...y'know that?  So beautiful. But I didn't have sex with anyone, you know?  I was not...I couldn't do anything...always scared, y'know... she was...she had some boyfriends...they liked her y'know...but I didn't like that. I couldn't get over that I wasn't a man, but she was a woman. Y'see?  Y'see I didn't make her feel ok about that....I would say, "How many men you been with?" She told me, I couldn't take it...take that I wasn't a man....because if I hadn't had sex with women...like as many women as she had men...then I was weak...a boy.... But I loved her...you understand? ....well, of course, I wanted to have sex with her...and I did and we were together....we met...age twelve, but then again...age seventeen...something, somethin... I didn't let her forget that I thought she was a bad...a slut.....a slut I would call her and hit her....I hit her for what she did...but we married...Lily and me and we married...but I cheated on her...over and over and over again...because I wanted to be a man and I couldn't let her be a woman...a smart, free person who was something...my mind then, so fuckin' stupid, so fuckin....jesus christ, what would I think...did I think....? ...for what I've done...She's my wife for thirty eight years...I went behind her... over and over...fucking asshole I am that I would go out and fuck and come home and get in her bed and say "I love you..."  This'z Jack's mother. His mother Lily...these two that I had and I lost .... and this is the regret that you make...the regret you make is the something that you take...blah...blah...blah... something, something.....  Gimme a cigarettee?
c10319 +++$+++ Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
c10319 +++$+++ They g-got the wrong g-guy.
c10319 +++$+++ I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
c21565 +++$+++ Good evening, Miss.
c21565 +++$+++ How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
c21565 +++$+++ I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
c21565 +++$+++ How long would that take?
c21565 +++$+++ Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
c21565 +++$+++ Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...
c16299 +++$+++ ...Well, that passed.
c16299 +++$+++ Yah?
c16299 +++$+++ Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
c16299 +++$+++ You had breakfast yet, Margie?
c16299 +++$+++ Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
c16299 +++$+++ Let's go take a look at that trooper.
c12249 +++$+++ I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
c12249 +++$+++ At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
c12249 +++$+++ Otho'll know what to do.
c12249 +++$+++ What's he going to do?  Viciously rearrange their environment?
c12249 +++$+++ Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
c12249 +++$+++ Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
c12249 +++$+++ Just don't tell Lydia.
c12249 +++$+++ I think she's in with them.
c19928 +++$+++ I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
c19928 +++$+++ It gets worse.
c19928 +++$+++ Then don't.
c13973 +++$+++ Father, I have sinned...
c13973 +++$+++ We'll talk about that later.
c13973 +++$+++ Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
c01995 +++$+++ Come on.  Try.
c01995 +++$+++ Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
c01995 +++$+++ Not when you have no choice.
c14626 +++$+++ Have we met?
c14626 +++$+++ I don't think so.
c14626 +++$+++ Did you know Sebastian well?
c14626 +++$+++ You might say that.
c14626 +++$+++ Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
c14626 +++$+++ I'm sure you're going to love it there.
c14583 +++$+++ I'm tired now.
c14583 +++$+++ Go to bed then.  Miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  God knows what the future will bring.
c14583 +++$+++ Autumn is coming.  I'll shut the windows for you.
c18343 +++$+++ A prior engagement overcame me.
c18343 +++$+++ What?
c18343 +++$+++ Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
c18343 +++$+++ Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
c18343 +++$+++ I just can't believe you could be so --
c10072 +++$+++ Mary ah, forget it.
c10072 +++$+++ What?
c10072 +++$+++ No, forget it, it was stupid.
c10072 +++$+++ Nah, really, it was moronic.
c18210 +++$+++ Where did you find this?
c18210 +++$+++ It was nailed to the cellar wall.
c18210 +++$+++ Runic?
c21434 +++$+++ What do you want?
c21434 +++$+++ Beer.  We need to go over your Q and A.
c21434 +++$+++ Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
c21434 +++$+++ Sure. It's fine.
c21434 +++$+++ Thank you.
c18995 +++$+++ Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?
c18995 +++$+++ I suppose...
c18995 +++$+++ Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
c18995 +++$+++ Yes.
c18995 +++$+++ How long was that?
c18995 +++$+++ So, you were a failure at the longest, most important relationship in your life.
c24484 +++$+++ Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
c24484 +++$+++ A normal person.
c24484 +++$+++ We can get to work on that oil!
c15446 +++$+++ What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
c15446 +++$+++ No... Could you?
c15446 +++$+++ No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
c15446 +++$+++ The what?
c15446 +++$+++ What?
c15297 +++$+++ So what do you keep in there?
c15297 +++$+++ Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
c15297 +++$+++ Everything. Just for the record.
c01074 +++$+++ How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
c01074 +++$+++ I don't know.
c01074 +++$+++ What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
c01074 +++$+++ I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
c06087 +++$+++ Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
c06087 +++$+++ We're square.
c06087 +++$+++ Thanks, man. You need anything, you call.
c06087 +++$+++ You rode?
c11466 +++$+++ You just stick by old Barbatus. He'll watch out for you.  Whatsamatter, kid?  Leave a girl behind?
c11466 +++$+++ Yeah.  Well -- no.  She's kind of playing hard to get.  As a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  So, what's on the schedule?  A brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
c11466 +++$+++ Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
c07657 +++$+++ You have no right to do this.
c07657 +++$+++ Well if I don't who will?
c07657 +++$+++ David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
c13541 +++$+++ Lady, try making some sense.
c13541 +++$+++ You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
c13541 +++$+++ What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
c13541 +++$+++ They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
c13541 +++$+++ Who smashed the phone?
c13541 +++$+++ They're holding my husband downstairs.
c13541 +++$+++ Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
c13541 +++$+++ They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
c13541 +++$+++ Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
c13541 +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
c13541 +++$+++ You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
c13541 +++$+++ I don't believe you.
c13541 +++$+++ You're the one who's not to be believed.
c13541 +++$+++ My name is --
c13541 +++$+++ I don't want to know --
c13541 +++$+++ My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
c13541 +++$+++ Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
c13541 +++$+++ I realize you don't want to be involved.
c13541 +++$+++ I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
c13541 +++$+++ You won't disconnect.
c13541 +++$+++ Oh won't I?
c13541 +++$+++ Because you know you'll be killing us.
c13541 +++$+++ Then hang up!  Do it!
c26541 +++$+++ ...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
c26541 +++$+++ That's right.
c26541 +++$+++ And what did your team do...
c26541 +++$+++ Well, we...
c26541 +++$+++ ...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear.  Isn't that what you did?
c26541 +++$+++ Yes.
c26541 +++$+++ ...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
c26541 +++$+++ ...We did everything we could...
c26541 +++$+++ ...to save her and to save the baby.  Is that...
c26541 +++$+++ Yes!
c26541 +++$+++ You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
c26541 +++$+++ Tell us.
c13231 +++$+++ I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
c13231 +++$+++ I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
c13231 +++$+++ What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
c13231 +++$+++ I can't talk right now.
c13231 +++$+++ What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
c13231 +++$+++ No...look I'm busy...
c13231 +++$+++ Listen to me...I don't want to lose this piece -
c13231 +++$+++ I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
c13231 +++$+++ Can't you see I'm busy here?
c01562 +++$+++ See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
c01562 +++$+++ I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
c01562 +++$+++ Well, we're here to help!
c06924 +++$+++ Tell me what, boy?
c06924 +++$+++ Nothin'!
c06924 +++$+++ No. No.
c11351 +++$+++ Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
c11351 +++$+++ I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
c11351 +++$+++ Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
c06518 +++$+++ Tell me why!
c06518 +++$+++ Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
c06518 +++$+++ When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
c06518 +++$+++ Would you settle for a husband?
c06518 +++$+++ What's this, Diz?
c06518 +++$+++ That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
c06518 +++$+++ You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
c00027 +++$+++ You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
c00027 +++$+++ You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
c00027 +++$+++ How much?
c10030 +++$+++ We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
c10030 +++$+++ Why?
c10030 +++$+++ They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
c10030 +++$+++ I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
c10030 +++$+++ There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
c10030 +++$+++ You're crazy.
c15449 +++$+++ I ... I'm not gonna do it.
c15449 +++$+++ What?
c15449 +++$+++ Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
c04672 +++$+++ -- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
c04672 +++$+++ Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
c04672 +++$+++ And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
c04672 +++$+++ -- and we are sure...
c21431 +++$+++ Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
c21431 +++$+++ They sabotaged me.
c21431 +++$+++ I knew you were going to say that. I don't buy it, and I don't see a case.
c21431 +++$+++ Correct. I don't.
c14836 +++$+++ People...  after me.
c14836 +++$+++ Who?
c14836 +++$+++ I don't know who they are.
c14836 +++$+++ Why are they after you?
c14836 +++$+++ Don't know much, do you?
c05075 +++$+++ Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
c05075 +++$+++ For what? For seeking the truth?
c05075 +++$+++ Please come quietly.
c05075 +++$+++ We're not going to hurt you.
c24048 +++$+++ How do they know that, you told them?
c24048 +++$+++ No.
c24048 +++$+++ What did you say to them...?
c24048 +++$+++ I didn't say anything to them.
c24048 +++$+++ How do you know you saw it?
c24048 +++$+++ I don't know.
c24048 +++$+++ Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
c24048 +++$+++ I don't...
c24048 +++$+++ You didn't see it...
c24048 +++$+++ You were there.  At...at 10:35...?
c25852 +++$+++ Well hello, Sherm.
c25852 +++$+++ You wanted to talk?
c25852 +++$+++ Yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
c25852 +++$+++ That what you got me up here for?
c25852 +++$+++ You're a Cowboy, you're a Brother.  Come back, no hard Feelings.
c25852 +++$+++ Forget it, Ringo.
c25852 +++$+++ Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
c25852 +++$+++ You're the boss.  One thing, though.
c02781 +++$+++ Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
c02781 +++$+++ I took the early rounds.
c02781 +++$+++ I'll bet.
c02781 +++$+++ I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
c02781 +++$+++ So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
c02781 +++$+++ Beats me.
c25854 +++$+++ So what about you Cowboys anyway?
c25854 +++$+++ If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
c25854 +++$+++ There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
c21520 +++$+++ 'I am not a missing link.'
c21520 +++$+++ Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
c21520 +++$+++ Well, maybe they're not.
c21520 +++$+++ No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
c21520 +++$+++ Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
c00857 +++$+++ Do you have a boyfriend?
c00857 +++$+++ No, not really.
c00857 +++$+++ Interesting.
c00857 +++$+++ Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
c00857 +++$+++ Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
c00857 +++$+++ Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
c00857 +++$+++ Growing. I'm glad you said that.
c03213 +++$+++ So what should we do?
c03213 +++$+++ Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
c03213 +++$+++ I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
c10366 +++$+++ Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
c10366 +++$+++ No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
c10366 +++$+++ You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
c10366 +++$+++ Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
c10366 +++$+++ What'll it be?
c10366 +++$+++ Fill 'er up.
c10366 +++$+++ I haven't got it yet.
c13297 +++$+++ What nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
c13297 +++$+++ I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
c13297 +++$+++ Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
c13297 +++$+++ Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
c13297 +++$+++ You should think about leaving, too, man.  Sell this place... Something's going on here.  I don't know.  Something real weird.
c04137 +++$+++ You're one of William's kids, huh?
c04137 +++$+++ His only kid.
c04137 +++$+++ Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
c04137 +++$+++ We were very close.
c04137 +++$+++ The resemblance is amazing.
c04137 +++$+++ I'll send them right up.
c21856 +++$+++ You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
c21856 +++$+++ Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
c21856 +++$+++ I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
c21856 +++$+++ A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty!
c09860 +++$+++ Not the only one.
c09860 +++$+++ The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
c09860 +++$+++ Neither will we.
c09860 +++$+++ Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
c09860 +++$+++ Then we'll never make it.
c13291 +++$+++ I can't!
c13291 +++$+++ You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
c13291 +++$+++ She has died.  You are the next to be called.  Why do you think you were sent to me?  Trained as you were?  You bear the mark.
c20572 +++$+++ Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
c20572 +++$+++ That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
c20572 +++$+++ Committed?
c20572 +++$+++ Committed.
c20572 +++$+++ Yes, it does.
c14849 +++$+++ That shelter was in this bill.
c14849 +++$+++ Alan
c14849 +++$+++ ) Listen, you little...
c16512 +++$+++ Robert Eroica...
c16512 +++$+++ Now don't...
c16512 +++$+++ That's good.
c19449 +++$+++ Mr. Kelson, here's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism.
c19449 +++$+++ What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
c19449 +++$+++ He can see you Thursday.
c19449 +++$+++ I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
c19449 +++$+++ The police used him as a witness in this case.
c19449 +++$+++ Nice suit.
c04092 +++$+++ I carried that rifle in World War I.  This book is a 16th Century policy report for the King of Austria.  The diploma is my con- ference of degree in Latin from Trinity College.  Class of 1672.  It goes on.
c04092 +++$+++ That's why Smith called you MacLeod.
c04092 +++$+++ Yes.
c04092 +++$+++ He knows about you.
c04092 +++$+++ He is older than I.
c04092 +++$+++ What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
c04092 +++$+++ Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
c04092 +++$+++ That's insane.
c04092 +++$+++ Perhaps.  There is something more. An inheritance.
c04092 +++$+++ Of bodies.
c04092 +++$+++ I didn't kill the watchman.
c04092 +++$+++ You killed those other two.
c04092 +++$+++ Not the same.
c04092 +++$+++ What about that family in '31?
c04092 +++$+++ Sometimes innocents become involved.
c04092 +++$+++ You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
c04092 +++$+++ There are differences.
c04092 +++$+++ You kill with your left hand?
c04092 +++$+++ Is that a threat?
c03006 +++$+++ I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
c03006 +++$+++ Yes?
c03006 +++$+++ What's the weather like outside?
c03006 +++$+++ I never get tired of that joke.
c03458 +++$+++ Hello.
c03458 +++$+++ Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
c03458 +++$+++ Benjamin?
c03458 +++$+++ Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
c03458 +++$+++ Where are you?
c03458 +++$+++ -- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
c03458 +++$+++ Where are you?
c03458 +++$+++ Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
c03458 +++$+++ Did you get a room?
c03458 +++$+++ No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
c03458 +++$+++ Give me an hour.
c03458 +++$+++ I'll be there in an hour.
c26217 +++$+++ That was very good.
c26217 +++$+++ Thank you.
c26217 +++$+++ If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?
c26217 +++$+++ Sure. No problem.
c26217 +++$+++ Absolutely.
c07531 +++$+++ Somebody has to.
c07531 +++$+++ Same old Daniel.
c07531 +++$+++ Oh no.  Not by a long shot.  I may look like the old Daniel O'Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.
c07531 +++$+++ Is that so?
c07531 +++$+++ Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
c07531 +++$+++ The big house?
c07531 +++$+++ The big house.
c07531 +++$+++ A cage by any other name would still smell like sweaty ugly men.
c14643 +++$+++ That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
c14643 +++$+++ Yes it does.
c14643 +++$+++ No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
c14643 +++$+++ I can't win with you.
c14643 +++$+++ It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
c14643 +++$+++ I do not.
c14643 +++$+++ Lighten up.
c14643 +++$+++ Fine.
c07218 +++$+++ So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
c07218 +++$+++ I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
c07218 +++$+++ I don't think I am.
c24172 +++$+++ Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
c24172 +++$+++ How much of this shit do they have, White!!
c24172 +++$+++ They must have got their hands on a test vial!
c24172 +++$+++ There's enough in one vial...
c25264 +++$+++ I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
c25264 +++$+++ Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
c25264 +++$+++ I can't tell you that yet. But he's being well looked after.
c25264 +++$+++ Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brother's not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than he'd bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news...
c18258 +++$+++ Who are you? How did you know who I am?
c18258 +++$+++ Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
c18258 +++$+++ But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
c18258 +++$+++ Ah keeps the ol' circle turning -- this ol' clock needs plenty o' care. Time is money, Miss Archuh, and money -- it drives that ol' global economy and keeps big Daddy Earth a-spinnin' on 'roun'. Ya see, without that capital fo'mation --
c18258 +++$+++ Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
c18258 +++$+++ I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
c18258 +++$+++ So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
c18258 +++$+++ Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
c18258 +++$+++ That smart?!
c18258 +++$+++ But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
c18258 +++$+++ 'Cause they's little pigglies! They's tryin' to inspire panic, make that stock git cheap so's they can snitch it all up fo' themselves! But Norville, he's got some tricks up his sleeve, he does...
c16355 +++$+++ I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
c16355 +++$+++ Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
c16355 +++$+++ Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
c16355 +++$+++ I've done you enough favors.
c12869 +++$+++ You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
c12869 +++$+++ No. I'll do them later.
c12869 +++$+++ Francesca?
c12869 +++$+++ What?
c12869 +++$+++ Are you all right?
c12869 +++$+++ Yes.
c12869 +++$+++ Francesca?
c12869 +++$+++ We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
c07471 +++$+++ Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
c07471 +++$+++ The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
c07471 +++$+++ Remember.
c13923 +++$+++ Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
c13923 +++$+++ What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
c13923 +++$+++ Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
c13923 +++$+++ Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
c13923 +++$+++ When was the last time?
c13923 +++$+++ Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
c23123 +++$+++ She's got a...
c23123 +++$+++ Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
c23123 +++$+++ Yeah, I think so.
c23123 +++$+++ That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
c23123 +++$+++ I don't know.
c23123 +++$+++ Gee, that's very serious...
c23123 +++$+++ I know.
c23123 +++$+++ Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
c23123 +++$+++ She did?
c23123 +++$+++ It turned out to be cancer.
c23123 +++$+++ Wow.
c23123 +++$+++ I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
c14933 +++$+++ Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
c14933 +++$+++ Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
c14933 +++$+++ Nothing wrong with research.
c10644 +++$+++ Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
c10644 +++$+++ Tripp.
c10644 +++$+++ Hit your brakes.
c24635 +++$+++ How are you tonight, Mr. Falco?
c24635 +++$+++ Is "he" inside?
c24635 +++$+++ But of course...
c24635 +++$+++ A Senator, an Agent and Something - With - Long - Red - Hair.
c02425 +++$+++ That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE...
c02425 +++$+++ Five this week; how many the week before?
c02425 +++$+++ And the week before that?
c13100 +++$+++ Do you have any music?
c13100 +++$+++ What?
c13100 +++$+++ John, play the Sinatra.
c11266 +++$+++ I'm getting a chest cold..
c11266 +++$+++ Bartok... a question.
c11266 +++$+++ What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
c00412 +++$+++ Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
c00412 +++$+++ Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
c00412 +++$+++ I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
c26883 +++$+++ Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.
c26883 +++$+++ Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
c26883 +++$+++ ...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
c26883 +++$+++ What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes.
c26942 +++$+++ What?
c26942 +++$+++ That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
c26942 +++$+++ No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it.  My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there.  Let's deal with that.  I'm willing to deal with that.  I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
c21956 +++$+++ I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
c21956 +++$+++ What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
c21956 +++$+++ Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
c01274 +++$+++ Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --
c01274 +++$+++ You and the Colonel go back.
c01274 +++$+++ He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
c01274 +++$+++ You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
c01274 +++$+++ It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
c01274 +++$+++ Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
c25599 +++$+++ What?
c25599 +++$+++ We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
c25599 +++$+++ What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
c13493 +++$+++ Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue...
c13493 +++$+++ No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -
c13493 +++$+++ ...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
c13493 +++$+++ Denying?
c13493 +++$+++ Mr. Chairman -
c08437 +++$+++ Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
c08437 +++$+++ Maya, how are you?
c08437 +++$+++ I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
c08437 +++$+++ Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
c08437 +++$+++ You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
c20460 +++$+++ No ..........I.
c20460 +++$+++ I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
c20460 +++$+++ She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
c20460 +++$+++ She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
c20460 +++$+++ Oh...
c19219 +++$+++ What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?
c19219 +++$+++ Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!
c19219 +++$+++ Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
c18935 +++$+++ What? This?
c18935 +++$+++ -- OK?
c18935 +++$+++ No thanks.
c16058 +++$+++ Come on.
c16058 +++$+++ Hey!
c16058 +++$+++ Time for what?
c20636 +++$+++ My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
c20636 +++$+++ It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
c20636 +++$+++ Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
c19616 +++$+++ You don't want any water?
c19616 +++$+++ No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
c19616 +++$+++ Are you on drugs right now?
c19616 +++$+++ If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
c19616 +++$+++ Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
c19616 +++$+++ Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
c19616 +++$+++ Linda, you're safe.  Ok. It's alright. You're my friend.  You and Earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
c19616 +++$+++ -- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
c19616 +++$+++ No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl.  When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand?  I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments...  I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
c10360 +++$+++ James called me last night looking for you.
c10360 +++$+++ When?
c10360 +++$+++ The usual, 9:15.
c10360 +++$+++ He probably wanted to drive over.
c10360 +++$+++ Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
c10360 +++$+++ No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
c10360 +++$+++ Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
c10360 +++$+++ I don't know what to do.
c10360 +++$+++ You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
c03608 +++$+++ I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
c03608 +++$+++ It's not your fault.
c03608 +++$+++ You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
c03608 +++$+++ I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
c03608 +++$+++ You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
c00825 +++$+++ Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
c00825 +++$+++ In English, Pinkerton.
c00825 +++$+++ There are only four banks within that travel radius which they have not robbed.
c00825 +++$+++ Can you put men at all four?
c00825 +++$+++ No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
c00825 +++$+++ Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
c19663 +++$+++ Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
c19663 +++$+++ Your Majesty has had many women --
c19663 +++$+++ That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
c19663 +++$+++ It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
c19663 +++$+++ What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
c19663 +++$+++ There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
c19663 +++$+++ You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
c19663 +++$+++ Not criticize -- plead.  Love.  Love your people, and you will not bear to see them hungry.  Love women, and they will love you.  Love yourself, and --
c19663 +++$+++ That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
c19663 +++$+++ At least help Raoul.
c19663 +++$+++ Silence!  I order you!
c19663 +++$+++ Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
c19663 +++$+++ Thank you, your Majesty.
c25729 +++$+++ You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
c25729 +++$+++ He started it.
c25729 +++$+++ But you're the more intelligent one.
c25729 +++$+++ That's true.
c25729 +++$+++ Then why did you do it?
c25729 +++$+++ Because I hate him--because I love you!
c25729 +++$+++ Well, he was in the navy.
c18629 +++$+++ Besides that.
c18629 +++$+++ I don't know, what else is there?
c18629 +++$+++ I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
c18629 +++$+++ The one that goes underwater?
c18629 +++$+++ Yes, it's great!
c18629 +++$+++ No, Kelly, I don't want to...
c18629 +++$+++ Come on, it's fun!
c18629 +++$+++ Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
c18629 +++$+++ You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
c18629 +++$+++ No, think of something else.
c18629 +++$+++ I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
c13655 +++$+++ Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
c13655 +++$+++ Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
c13655 +++$+++ Why would you do that?
c13655 +++$+++ The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
c13655 +++$+++ So?
c13655 +++$+++ And anyway, he's seen our faces.
c13655 +++$+++ He described me down to a T. Knows what Jude looks like.
c23345 +++$+++ An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
c23345 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c23345 +++$+++ I was afraid of this.
c20774 +++$+++ We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
c20774 +++$+++ Wayne, if it was anybody else---
c20774 +++$+++ Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
c20774 +++$+++ What are we talking about?
c20774 +++$+++ Two guys?
c20774 +++$+++ Okay. I'll take two guys off.
c20774 +++$+++ No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
c20774 +++$+++ I can't do that. Five guys.
c20774 +++$+++ I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
c01410 +++$+++ You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
c01410 +++$+++ I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
c01410 +++$+++ I didn't start this, R.L.
c17426 +++$+++ I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
c17426 +++$+++ You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
c17426 +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
c17426 +++$+++ Didn' you have no breakfast?
c17426 +++$+++ Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
c13269 +++$+++ You were supposed to be here at three.
c13269 +++$+++ I forgot.
c13269 +++$+++ Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
c13269 +++$+++ Oh my God you're having an affair.
c03586 +++$+++ Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
c03586 +++$+++ An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
c03586 +++$+++ You're discharged.
c03586 +++$+++ Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
c12323 +++$+++ It's that gardener!
c12323 +++$+++ Yes, Chauncey Gardiner.
c12323 +++$+++ He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
c17179 +++$+++ I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
c17179 +++$+++ Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
c17179 +++$+++ He says here good-bye.  I find it in his room.  He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
c11047 +++$+++ Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
c11047 +++$+++ Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
c11047 +++$+++ The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
c11047 +++$+++ It's good luck before an audition. She'll be all right once it starts.
c02267 +++$+++ It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
c02267 +++$+++ So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
c02267 +++$+++ And you'd never been there before?
c13987 +++$+++ The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
c13987 +++$+++ It didn't end very well, did it?
c13987 +++$+++ It ended -  Then there was Susie - that ended, too.  I guess he didn't make her very happy -  You know, I was thinking - that Rosebud you're trying to find out about -
c13987 +++$+++ Yes -
c13987 +++$+++ Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
c13987 +++$+++ In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
c13987 +++$+++ You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
c13987 +++$+++ Just old age.  It's the only disease, Mr. Thompson, you don't look forward to being cured of.  You ought to see Mr. Leland.  There's a whole lot of things he could tell you - if he wanted to.
c02458 +++$+++ Shut up!
c02458 +++$+++ She knows it was our fault!
c02458 +++$+++ No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
c19569 +++$+++ Doc it's Janet.
c19569 +++$+++ What's up?
c19569 +++$+++ I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
c19569 +++$+++ He's doing the interview with the lady --
c19569 +++$+++ I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
c19569 +++$+++ Doc, go get Frank and put him on the phone.
c07235 +++$+++ Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it!  Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
c07235 +++$+++ I got you, Del...
c07235 +++$+++ ...well, then you ain't got much.
c07235 +++$+++ Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
c03957 +++$+++ They took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. In the boards, in the walls. Watching the world, but not able to TOUCH it.
c03957 +++$+++ And the blood let you out?
c03957 +++$+++ Yes. They'll never find us.
c26119 +++$+++ I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
c26119 +++$+++ Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
c26119 +++$+++ Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
c26119 +++$+++ I don't have time, Sark. And neither do you. End of line.
c21339 +++$+++ Is that the good new, Sir, or --
c21339 +++$+++ You're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience, so you're volunteering for a mission I've been ordered to put together.  Do you know what top secret is?
c21339 +++$+++ Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
c09965 +++$+++ I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
c09965 +++$+++ How...how do you know?
c09965 +++$+++ You told me this was how it happened.
c09965 +++$+++ Yeah.
c14676 +++$+++ Why not?
c14676 +++$+++ Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
c14676 +++$+++ That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
c06810 +++$+++ Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
c06810 +++$+++ I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
c06810 +++$+++ I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
c06810 +++$+++ You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
c06810 +++$+++ Yes -- an excellent idea.
c13970 +++$+++ Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world!
c13970 +++$+++ Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go.  And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
c13970 +++$+++ You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
c13970 +++$+++ No! You mean right at the end?  ALFREDO That's right, Toto, right at the end? And don't ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know...
c06243 +++$+++ That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
c06243 +++$+++ I heard you, Ma.
c06243 +++$+++ She's twenty-nine, Ma.
c16246 +++$+++ Sabotage? I don't understand...
c16246 +++$+++ I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
c16246 +++$+++ You have no right to blame Duval --
c16246 +++$+++ That line was tampered with...
c16246 +++$+++ I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
c16246 +++$+++ You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
c16246 +++$+++ I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
c16246 +++$+++ It's possible --
c10400 +++$+++ They lied.
c10400 +++$+++ 'They lied.' Indeed! When did they lie? And do you know what a lie is?
c10400 +++$+++ I do. Yes.
c10400 +++$+++ You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
c10400 +++$+++ That's not my handwriting.
c10400 +++$+++ You've just said you signed it.
c10400 +++$+++ Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
c10400 +++$+++ Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.
c00258 +++$+++ It's up to you now, Angel!
c00258 +++$+++ I'm so tired...
c00258 +++$+++ You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
c00258 +++$+++ Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
c01827 +++$+++ Here's what I've got.  Remember Vladimir Neski? Russian politician? Seven years ago, he was due to speak to a group of European Oil ministers here at the hotel. He never did. He was murdered.
c01827 +++$+++ By who?
c01827 +++$+++ Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
c05738 +++$+++ I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
c05738 +++$+++ C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
c05738 +++$+++ In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
c05738 +++$+++ You did it for Namath.
c05738 +++$+++ Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
c05738 +++$+++ Now you're talking.
c06855 +++$+++ Can I help you?
c06855 +++$+++ Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
c06855 +++$+++ I don't play for no team.
c06855 +++$+++ Come on, jerky, you can tell me.  Got a white wife, huh?  Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for?  You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
c06855 +++$+++ Okay, buddy.  Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  It's just a certified mail delivery.
c23050 +++$+++ Is there a man?
c23050 +++$+++ A man, my lord?
c23050 +++$+++ There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
c23050 +++$+++ A theatre poet?
c23050 +++$+++ An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
c23050 +++$+++ That dog!
c03485 +++$+++ Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
c03485 +++$+++ There!
c03485 +++$+++ What?
c03485 +++$+++ Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
c03485 +++$+++ Him?
c03485 +++$+++ I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
c03485 +++$+++ There's no risk?
c01900 +++$+++ Here's to you, sir.
c01900 +++$+++ Er, good luck, yes.
c01900 +++$+++ I'd better be going.
c01900 +++$+++ I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
c21808 +++$+++ Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
c21808 +++$+++ The body?
c21808 +++$+++ Have you any money?
c21808 +++$+++ I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.
c27118 +++$+++ I told you you could do it.
c27118 +++$+++ I was like a different person tonight.
c27118 +++$+++ You were the new and improved you.
c27118 +++$+++ I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
c27118 +++$+++ No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
c27118 +++$+++ It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
c27118 +++$+++ You ARE home. But go ahead, finish school, do what you feel you need to do. In the meantime, I'll be your point person here on the magazine.
c27118 +++$+++ Really? You'd do that for me?
c27118 +++$+++ I've been very lazy for a long, long time.
c27118 +++$+++ You seem like you're anything but lazy, Uncle Billy.
c27118 +++$+++ I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
c27118 +++$+++ My parents always say hard work builds character.
c27118 +++$+++ It's not like I didn't have ideas, I had plenty of ideas. But I never even shared them with your father. Never had the guts.
c27118 +++$+++ What kind of ideas?
c27118 +++$+++ Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
c27118 +++$+++ You think we should be more open minded?
c27118 +++$+++ The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
c27118 +++$+++ In other words, our scope is too narrow.
c27118 +++$+++ That's perfect.
c03998 +++$+++ Nice, Barry.
c03998 +++$+++ Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
c03998 +++$+++ You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
c03998 +++$+++ We didn't even really have it.  I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
c03998 +++$+++ Not the point.
c03998 +++$+++ Oh, so what's the point then?
c03998 +++$+++ "Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
c14046 +++$+++ Am I missing something here?
c14046 +++$+++ I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
c14046 +++$+++ He was?
c14046 +++$+++ You dog! I didn't see you go back there.
c23279 +++$+++ It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
c23279 +++$+++ I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
c23279 +++$+++ Was it a prescription?
c23279 +++$+++ What the hell does that matter?
c23279 +++$+++ It wasn't- I'll bet you it wasn't. Because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
c23279 +++$+++ Marty, Marty, you should hear yourself!
c23279 +++$+++ Well... was it a prescription?
c23279 +++$+++ I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
c23279 +++$+++ What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
c23279 +++$+++ You want to know what I think?
c23279 +++$+++ Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
c23037 +++$+++ I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
c23037 +++$+++ Oh, my love  You ran from me before.
c23037 +++$+++ You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
c23037 +++$+++ If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
c00898 +++$+++ Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
c00898 +++$+++ I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
c00898 +++$+++ I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
c00898 +++$+++ I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
c00898 +++$+++ Nobody does work like this on-line. It's in your PC, or in a mainframe. Self-contained. They'd have to be, like, watching people. Physically.  Oh Jesus.
c22773 +++$+++ You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure.  You have to think of it in his situation.  He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people.  Never the good, always the bad.  Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  He'd be all right.  There'd be just the good aspects of him.  Which is a wonderful crook.  A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
c22773 +++$+++ And killing.
c22773 +++$+++ There's nothing you can do.  I'm not asking you to do anything.  You came into my office.
c07887 +++$+++ Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
c07887 +++$+++ What did I do?
c07887 +++$+++ You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
c07887 +++$+++ All I did...
c07887 +++$+++ You're hurting my arm.
c25315 +++$+++ It's wet. Will this do?
c25315 +++$+++ Where's your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
c25315 +++$+++ Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
c25315 +++$+++ Shut up! Where's your wallet?
c25315 +++$+++ Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My finger's on the trigger, you hear!
c26568 +++$+++ Hello, I'm calling from...
c26568 +++$+++ If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
c26568 +++$+++ I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
c26568 +++$+++ From the magazine?
c26568 +++$+++ This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
c26568 +++$+++ How come you're calling me from...?
c26568 +++$+++ This is Miss Costello...?
c26568 +++$+++ Yes.  Price...
c26568 +++$+++ Pardon?
c26568 +++$+++ Kathy Price.
c26568 +++$+++ We find that your subscription lapsed...
c26568 +++$+++ My subscription lapsed three years ago...
c26568 +++$+++ That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
c26568 +++$+++ Missus...
c26568 +++$+++ We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
c26568 +++$+++ We get it at work.  We get the magazine at work.
c26568 +++$+++ No.  At Chelsea Childcare.  Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey?  I'm late for work.
c05080 +++$+++ Paul! You son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? I haven't seen you in what, five, six, years?
c05080 +++$+++ A long time.
c05080 +++$+++ Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
c05080 +++$+++ Nothin' much.
c05080 +++$+++ Me neither. Nothing too exciting. So tell me, to what do I owe the honor?
c05080 +++$+++ I need to see you, Jake.
c05080 +++$+++ I need to see you.
c20523 +++$+++ Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
c20523 +++$+++ I thought I told you to lose this guy.
c20523 +++$+++ Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
c20523 +++$+++ I think the phrase was &quot;Sleazoid Geek&quot;.
c20523 +++$+++ You're still asking me to break the law.
c19458 +++$+++ I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
c19458 +++$+++ Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
c19458 +++$+++ Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
c09622 +++$+++ Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
c09622 +++$+++ I do.
c09622 +++$+++ Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
c09622 +++$+++ Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
c09622 +++$+++ The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today, Mr. Appleton.  We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee?
c09622 +++$+++ I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
c09622 +++$+++ A statement?
c26082 +++$+++ Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
c26082 +++$+++ Captain, what have I done -
c26082 +++$+++ What you have done is betray every man on this ship.
c26082 +++$+++ Worse. I have betrayed you. I do not expect you to forgive me.
c26082 +++$+++ If you think it would help.
c06345 +++$+++ Is there a crowd in the street?
c06345 +++$+++ No, sir.
c06345 +++$+++ Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
c06345 +++$+++ I think it must have been a sea- gull.
c06345 +++$+++ A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it?
c06345 +++$+++ I-it's all right, Mrs. Brewster. It was just a sea-gull.  Er. nothing's happened yet! No, I'm watching. Don't worry. Ju-just leave it all to me!
c04368 +++$+++ How do you feel?
c04368 +++$+++ Fast and loose, man.
c04368 +++$+++ I feel tight -- but good.
c11954 +++$+++ I hope these are your shoes.
c11954 +++$+++ Hi, Charlie.
c11954 +++$+++ Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
c05785 +++$+++ We don't get many Sandmen. I think we've only had one other since I've been here.
c05785 +++$+++ A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
c05785 +++$+++ I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
c05785 +++$+++ It's all right with me. Is he here?
c05785 +++$+++ No -- Look, I'm in a hurry.
c24810 +++$+++ Mr. Van Orton... ?
c24810 +++$+++ Ilsa... you're alright?
c24810 +++$+++ Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
c24810 +++$+++ Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
c24810 +++$+++ There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
c25536 +++$+++ How are you?
c25536 +++$+++ Hello, Macaulay.  Come in.
c25536 +++$+++ That's all right.  What are you drinking?
c19037 +++$+++ Your father had been very sick.
c19037 +++$+++ He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
c19037 +++$+++ Cow.
c19037 +++$+++ Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
c19037 +++$+++ Me. First break of day.
c19037 +++$+++ I pooped.
c19811 +++$+++ Morpheus, I don't think this is a good idea.
c19811 +++$+++ Why?
c19811 +++$+++ I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
c19811 +++$+++ What do you believe in?
c19811 +++$+++ What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
c19811 +++$+++ That's why we're here.
c19811 +++$+++ Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
c19811 +++$+++ Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
c19811 +++$+++ And you still believe I'm the One?
c19811 +++$+++ Yeah?  What about the other five guys?  The five before me?  What about them?
c08049 +++$+++ What?
c08049 +++$+++ I said, who the hell made the map?
c08049 +++$+++ I did.
c08049 +++$+++ This isn't the Tomahawk.
c08049 +++$+++ This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
c26375 +++$+++ Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
c26375 +++$+++ I'm just going to my car?
c26375 +++$+++ That's right on my way.
c26375 +++$+++ My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
c26375 +++$+++ My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
c26375 +++$+++ Do you have to call me that?
c26375 +++$+++ Maybe I don't want you to.
c18701 +++$+++ Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
c18701 +++$+++ How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
c18701 +++$+++ They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
c18701 +++$+++ Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
c18701 +++$+++ That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
c18701 +++$+++ Listen to me saying what?
c18701 +++$+++ I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
c18701 +++$+++ We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is "Jennifer <u>Eight</u>."
c00725 +++$+++ Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I--
c00725 +++$+++ Why not?
c00725 +++$+++ You don't have to do nothing.
c24865 +++$+++ You weren't disappointed in her, then.
c24865 +++$+++ In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't.
c24865 +++$+++ She was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... Straight from leaving you.
c24865 +++$+++ She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't.
c04332 +++$+++ How's work?
c04332 +++$+++ Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
c04332 +++$+++ No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
c04332 +++$+++ My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
c04332 +++$+++ I guess.
c11983 +++$+++ Do you have a cigarette?
c11983 +++$+++ I don't smoke.
c11983 +++$+++ I quit.
c11166 +++$+++ You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
c11166 +++$+++ Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
c11166 +++$+++ She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
c11166 +++$+++ That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
c11166 +++$+++ Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
c11166 +++$+++ Where?  What do you mean, where?
c11166 +++$+++ --I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
c19873 +++$+++ I hate parties --
c19873 +++$+++ Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
c19873 +++$+++ No.
c03423 +++$+++ All right.
c03423 +++$+++ During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
c03423 +++$+++ Okay.
c03423 +++$+++ You sure you really want to?
c03423 +++$+++ Yes.
c03423 +++$+++ Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
c03423 +++$+++ I do.
c03423 +++$+++ Benjamin -- I really do.
c26458 +++$+++ The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
c26458 +++$+++ About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
c26458 +++$+++ What'd Ned say?
c26458 +++$+++ L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
c26458 +++$+++ Then... what?
c26458 +++$+++ A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
c26458 +++$+++ Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
c13246 +++$+++ Invite me in, Pike.
c13246 +++$+++ Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
c13246 +++$+++ You look like shit, Benny.
c15302 +++$+++ A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
c15302 +++$+++ We felt his presence.
c15302 +++$+++ I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
c15302 +++$+++ Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
c15302 +++$+++ Yes?
c15302 +++$+++ Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
c15302 +++$+++ I am your Truthsayer, my lord...  He is here, my lord.
c13348 +++$+++ He walked eighteen?!
c13348 +++$+++ It's a league record.
c13348 +++$+++ League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
c03749 +++$+++ How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
c03749 +++$+++ A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
c03749 +++$+++ Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
c03749 +++$+++ She's crying because she's so happy.
c15506 +++$+++ Way to go, Tracy!  Isn't this exciting?
c15506 +++$+++ Yeah.
c15506 +++$+++ Hell, good luck!
c15506 +++$+++ Thanks!
c04675 +++$+++ She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
c04675 +++$+++ So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
c04675 +++$+++ Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
c04675 +++$+++ Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
c04675 +++$+++ I don't need it.
c04675 +++$+++ You want Botox?
c04675 +++$+++ What the hell is Botox?
c04675 +++$+++ It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
c04675 +++$+++ Why in God's name would I want...?
c04675 +++$+++ No frown lines.  New watch?
c04675 +++$+++ It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
c04675 +++$+++ Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
c04675 +++$+++ It was a gift from a client.
c04675 +++$+++ Set one side for Bel Air.
c04675 +++$+++ Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
c04675 +++$+++ We did not.
c04675 +++$+++ You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
c04675 +++$+++ Denial is not a river in Egypt.
c18789 +++$+++ Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
c18789 +++$+++ No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
c18789 +++$+++ That does sound lucky.
c18789 +++$+++ Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most idiotic.
c16332 +++$+++ I must've left the original in the copy machine.
c16332 +++$+++ "The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
c16332 +++$+++ Hmm?
c16332 +++$+++ You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
c16332 +++$+++ Pretend you're me.  You find this. What would you do?
c26706 +++$+++ Blood money. Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all. In no way have you mentioned that money. And I find that to be very very offensive.
c26706 +++$+++ You're sick.
c26706 +++$+++ And if you think you can fuck me, don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated Fisher. Protected. Backed up on floppy. Do you get me? I want my fucking money!
c26706 +++$+++ Not a prayer.
c26706 +++$+++ You need help.
c23372 +++$+++ It is only me.
c23372 +++$+++ Katrina.  Why do you follow?
c23372 +++$+++ I apologize if I worried you.
c23372 +++$+++ But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and...  To thank you.
c09663 +++$+++ Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
c09663 +++$+++ She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
c09663 +++$+++ Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
c09663 +++$+++ What's the matter with them?
c02883 +++$+++ Dad, when I called the machine to check our messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr. Franklin said he wouldn't permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home, if you still feel the same way --
c02883 +++$+++ That's very nice of Ted, but I'll call him tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.
c02883 +++$+++ I didn't want to talk about this in front of Scott because he gets upset. But you don't believe in God anymore?
c02883 +++$+++ Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this is hard on you kids. After Jenny's death, this is probably the last thing you need. But I can't do it any longer. My congregation needs spiritual leadership. Well, they can't get that from me anymore. My faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what's the point?
c02883 +++$+++ It's just, all our lives you've been a pastor. For twenty years you've preached trust in the lord. And then one day you wake up and say fuck him?
c02883 +++$+++ I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not connected anymore.
c02883 +++$+++ That happens, you'll get it back.
c02883 +++$+++ Kate, give your old man a little credit. Every person who chooses the service of God as their life's work has something in common. I don't care if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun, a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you'll look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've all done it. I'm not going through a lapse. What I've experienced is closer to awakening. I'm not trying to shake your faith. I've just decided not to devote my life to God anymore.
c02883 +++$+++ Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
c04684 +++$+++ Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
c04684 +++$+++ What does your lawyer think?
c04684 +++$+++ Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
c04684 +++$+++ But you don't agree?
c04684 +++$+++ How do you know?
c04684 +++$+++ I told you. I was hungry.
c14385 +++$+++ I don't see no sign of guts in you.
c14385 +++$+++ No. No chains either.
c14385 +++$+++ You ain't man enough to wear them!
c14385 +++$+++ But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
c14385 +++$+++ Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
c14385 +++$+++ You phony creep!
c09187 +++$+++ Where did you stop last?
c09187 +++$+++ What the hell do you think you're doing?
c09187 +++$+++ Where did you stop last?
c09187 +++$+++ Stay right there...
c09187 +++$+++ What was your last stop?
c09187 +++$+++ Elmo's...
c09187 +++$+++ About five miles back.
c05473 +++$+++ I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
c05473 +++$+++ You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
c05473 +++$+++ Yeah... I'd like that.
c08212 +++$+++ Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
c08212 +++$+++ ...Browsing.
c08212 +++$+++ Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
c08212 +++$+++ I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
c08212 +++$+++ NO! I could never hurt anyone!
c21581 +++$+++ I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
c21581 +++$+++ Wonder what?
c21581 +++$+++ If you're doing all this just for me.
c21581 +++$+++ That, and the fun of it.
c21581 +++$+++ That's right.
c18464 +++$+++ Jeez, that's a full carat --
c18464 +++$+++ How much?
c18464 +++$+++ How much?
c06470 +++$+++ Yeah, I know - Picasso. <u>Guernica</u>, right? That's what everybody says - although personally, I don't see the resemblance. What are you drinking?
c06470 +++$+++ Uhh - martini?
c06470 +++$+++ Olive or eyeball?
c06470 +++$+++ Olive. - Where exactly am I?
c06470 +++$+++ Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
c06470 +++$+++ Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're quite a celebrity down here.
c12828 +++$+++ Michael -- get off the phone.
c12828 +++$+++ Why?
c12828 +++$+++ Because I'm expecting a call.
c12828 +++$+++ -- But it's Sunday.
c12828 +++$+++ I gotta go.  I'll call you later.
c04473 +++$+++ Fraulein -- will you permit me?
c04473 +++$+++ I usually don't.
c04473 +++$+++ In that case, I permit you.
c14514 +++$+++ Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
c14514 +++$+++ No, no.
c14514 +++$+++ Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
c09458 +++$+++ What will your father say?
c09458 +++$+++ As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
c09458 +++$+++ What time do they expect us?
c09458 +++$+++ For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
c09458 +++$+++ Then we can have dinner, see a show, and spend one more night.
c25941 +++$+++ Hey!  Wow!
c25941 +++$+++ What?  What is it?
c25941 +++$+++ Woody!  Buzz!
c25941 +++$+++ Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
c25941 +++$+++ See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
c23696 +++$+++ Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
c23696 +++$+++ What's a dying giraffe sound like?
c23696 +++$+++ Kay.
c02041 +++$+++ Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
c02041 +++$+++ I haven't read that.
c02041 +++$+++ I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
c02041 +++$+++ When *doesn't* he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped." Would you?
c02076 +++$+++ What about Customs?
c02076 +++$+++ I'll worry about Customs.
c02076 +++$+++ Take a deep breath. You sound like you just broke up with your boyfriend or something.
c07357 +++$+++ What the fuck is funny about this?
c07357 +++$+++ God.
c07357 +++$+++ Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
c15951 +++$+++ Do you keep any drugs in your house?
c15951 +++$+++ No. Of course not, nothing like that.
c15951 +++$+++ Are you sure?
c15951 +++$+++ Well of course I'm sure. I'd tell you. Christ, I don't even smoke grass.
c15951 +++$+++ Are you planning to be home soon? LA, I mean.
c15951 +++$+++ I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
c19359 +++$+++ Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
c19359 +++$+++ You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
c19359 +++$+++ Philip Swann?
c19359 +++$+++ You know of him?
c19359 +++$+++ I saw him in Vegas once.
c19359 +++$+++ Are you a gambling man?
c19359 +++$+++ When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
c19359 +++$+++ Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
c19359 +++$+++ Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real.
c09497 +++$+++ ...The thousand dollars, of course, was only due in the event that you succeeded in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I hope the trip has afforded you some pleasure despite the failure of its main objective you need no longer consider yourself obligated to us in any way...
c09497 +++$+++ You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
c09497 +++$+++ I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
c09497 +++$+++ I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've had a good run, haven't we?
c09497 +++$+++ I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on here without money. It's time we all moved on. Besides I'm sick of Mongi. Especially now with everything -- I really want to move to the North. I need to check out San Remo next week, find somewhere new to keep the boat. But it would be great, though, if you came with me. Our last trip before you leave. There's a jazz festival -- we could say goodbye in style. What do you think? A last trip?
c16686 +++$+++ I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
c16686 +++$+++ Strike out, eh?
c16686 +++$+++ Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
c16686 +++$+++ A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
c16686 +++$+++ When ya go back on?
c16686 +++$+++ Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.  A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.
c23312 +++$+++ It has come to pass.
c23312 +++$+++ What?
c23312 +++$+++ I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
c23312 +++$+++ Are you talking about me?
c23312 +++$+++ And all those like you.
c23312 +++$+++ You mean black people?
c23312 +++$+++ Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
c23312 +++$+++ Check your driver's license.
c06149 +++$+++ We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
c06149 +++$+++ This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
c06149 +++$+++ This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
c06149 +++$+++ I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
c06149 +++$+++ I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
c06149 +++$+++ He's bright.
c06149 +++$+++ They talked about me like
c06149 +++$+++ I wasn't there. Like I was some kind of pedigreed dog or a horse. Like I was invisible.
c13520 +++$+++ I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
c13520 +++$+++ You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
c13520 +++$+++ Uh-huh..
c15139 +++$+++ Gene -- you smilin'?
c15139 +++$+++ No.  I never smile any more.
c15139 +++$+++ Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
c15139 +++$+++ Gene, Jesus, what a bull he is!
c10413 +++$+++ They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
c10413 +++$+++ Why is that?
c10413 +++$+++ Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
c10413 +++$+++ ...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
c10413 +++$+++ ...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
c10413 +++$+++ Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
c10413 +++$+++ I am seventy-four years old.
c10413 +++$+++ What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
c10413 +++$+++ I am on the staff of...
c10413 +++$+++ ...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
c07971 +++$+++ Hi.
c07971 +++$+++ Hi there.
c07971 +++$+++ You remember me?
c07971 +++$+++ I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
c05032 +++$+++ Demons? I don't know what to tell you. It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. The problem, Jacob, is that you have no context for it. You're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after Freud. How the hell am I supposed to make it fit?
c05032 +++$+++ I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
c05032 +++$+++ Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
c05032 +++$+++ But I see them.
c05032 +++$+++ Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
c05032 +++$+++ I'venever understood you, you know that? You were by far the best pupil I've ever had, bar none. Intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. Who knows, maybe you've been "elected" to see demons. Maybe you're in touch with ... some- thing. Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob. Nothing.
c22694 +++$+++ The, uh, Cynthia Branson estate was worth how much?  Because her family...
c22694 +++$+++ What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
c22694 +++$+++ Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
c22694 +++$+++ That's right.
c22694 +++$+++ Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
c09075 +++$+++ The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
c09075 +++$+++ Absolutely.
c09075 +++$+++ Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
c20857 +++$+++ It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
c20857 +++$+++ It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
c20857 +++$+++ That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
c03036 +++$+++ Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
c03036 +++$+++ Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
c03036 +++$+++ I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
c17061 +++$+++ Is that what you're saying?
c17061 +++$+++ That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  I'd like something off the other list.  Which, very least, that I'm entitled to.  If I'm still working here, which for the moment I guess that I am.  What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to you.
c17061 +++$+++ The deal still stands, our other thing.
c14087 +++$+++ Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
c14087 +++$+++ Let me borrow your car.
c14087 +++$+++ May I be blunt with you?
c14087 +++$+++ If you must.
c14087 +++$+++ We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.
c14087 +++$+++ There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.
c23620 +++$+++ Ah, a philosopher.
c23620 +++$+++ Shrink, actually.
c23620 +++$+++ Crikey.
c23620 +++$+++ What?
c23620 +++$+++ Nothing, nothing.
c23620 +++$+++ You Yanks and your therapy. It's great.  It's all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
c19919 +++$+++ You act like you never had peanut butter before --
c19919 +++$+++ I haven't.
c19919 +++$+++ -- What kind of childhood did you have?
c19919 +++$+++ Do you love Drew?
c19919 +++$+++ Come again?
c19919 +++$+++ When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
c19919 +++$+++ Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
c19919 +++$+++ I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
c19919 +++$+++ No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
c19919 +++$+++ I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
c19919 +++$+++ I've got plenty of friends.
c19919 +++$+++ I can see why.
c03591 +++$+++ No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
c03591 +++$+++ Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
c03591 +++$+++ Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
c03591 +++$+++ Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
c03591 +++$+++ I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
c03591 +++$+++ Good night.
c03759 +++$+++ Here.  Finish the job.
c03759 +++$+++ I'm utterly satisfied.
c03759 +++$+++ You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
c03759 +++$+++ More clowning!  Don't you see?
c03759 +++$+++ We never quit fighting until we're dead.
c03759 +++$+++ You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
c03759 +++$+++ I'm going to shoot you now.
c03759 +++$+++ No!
c03759 +++$+++ My self-respect is gone--and my soldier's honor with it.  It is now very easy for me to shoot an unarmed man.
c03759 +++$+++ New dignity can be yours--as a merciful man.  You can change!
c03759 +++$+++ Like the saber-toothed tiger.
c03759 +++$+++ Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
c03759 +++$+++ Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
c03759 +++$+++ If you want to be found that way.
c03759 +++$+++ What is this thing that kills me?
c03759 +++$+++ Man, as man was meant to be--a vengeful ape who murders.  He will soon be extinct.  It's time, it's time.
c03759 +++$+++ I've enjoyed being man.
c16489 +++$+++ Will you shut-up!!!
c16489 +++$+++ You're a true <u>friend</u>.
c16489 +++$+++ I'm not. Believe me. <u>I'm</u> scum.
c16489 +++$+++ You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
c16489 +++$+++ I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
c16489 +++$+++ That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
c16489 +++$+++ I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
c16489 +++$+++ WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ...  You know none of this is true -                           PARRY the Grail, the voices...                           Jack... There's a part of you that                         Come on...what are knows this isn't true.                             saying... I know who you are...                              I know who you are.. or who you were.                                   You're acting really- You don't belong on the                            No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent                        Jack... man....you're a teacher...                         Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?...
c21233 +++$+++ That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
c21233 +++$+++ Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
c21233 +++$+++ You know that Super Bowl party?  They changed the date.  It's on <u>tonight</u>, eight-thirty.
c21233 +++$+++ Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
c21233 +++$+++ I said not as a rule.
c21233 +++$+++ So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
c21233 +++$+++ Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
c21233 +++$+++ What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
c21233 +++$+++ What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
c21233 +++$+++ Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
c21233 +++$+++ Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
c21233 +++$+++ And the one driving the other car?
c21233 +++$+++ What're you talking about?
c21233 +++$+++ Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
c21233 +++$+++ Glenn Michaels.
c21233 +++$+++ He did, huh.  Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em.  I might not even take 'em off first.
c21081 +++$+++ I want those men put back to bed, Mister Turkle!
c21081 +++$+++ Yes, ma'am...
c21081 +++$+++ Yes, ma'am...
c24332 +++$+++ ...so, while it's a laugh riot for the whole family, and Tim Conway is just about as funny as they come, especially when he goes...
c24332 +++$+++ Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
c24332 +++$+++ Am I the only one who cares about this? At least I watched "Dog Day Afternoon!"
c03066 +++$+++ Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.
c03066 +++$+++ It's the freest land on earth.
c03066 +++$+++ Well, we must be who we must be...
c15903 +++$+++ Stop the damn car.
c15903 +++$+++ No way.
c15903 +++$+++ All right. Anything for you, Snake.  Although I was going to take you to Cuervo Jones' place.
c19706 +++$+++ Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
c19706 +++$+++ Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
c19706 +++$+++ I don't know, Jack. He's got no face for me.
c19706 +++$+++ You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
c19706 +++$+++ Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
c19706 +++$+++ What's one way?
c19706 +++$+++ We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
c19706 +++$+++ We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
c19706 +++$+++ He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
c19706 +++$+++ No other possibilities?
c19706 +++$+++ You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
c19706 +++$+++ Why?
c19706 +++$+++ Because he has a genuine taste for it, Jack.
c19706 +++$+++ ...I'm going to see Lecktor.
c02060 +++$+++ Grifters...
c02060 +++$+++ We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
c02060 +++$+++ Isn't it always?
c15378 +++$+++ Ed!  What's with these revised pages?!  A scene in a smelting factory?  A buffalo stampede?? <u>Three-hundred soldiers storming Anzio</u> <u>Beach</u>??!  What's going on here?  I can't afford to film this nonsense!
c15378 +++$+++ Don't worry.  We're not gonna film any of it.
c15378 +++$+++ I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
c03453 +++$+++ Mr. McCleery?
c03453 +++$+++ You heard me. Out of here.
c03453 +++$+++ Because I don't like you.
c08118 +++$+++ Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
c08118 +++$+++ So you wanna git bit, huh?
c08118 +++$+++ Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
c08118 +++$+++ You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
c08118 +++$+++ Then. That time has passed. Right now, Mr. Blonde is the only one I completely trust. He's too fuckin' homicidal to be workin' with the cops.
c08118 +++$+++ Fuck sides! What we need is a little solidarity here. Somebody's stickin' a red hot poker up our asses and we gotta find out whose hand's on the handle. Now I know I'm no piece of shit...  And I'm pretty sure you're a good boy...  And I'm fuckin positive you're on the level. So let's figure out who's the bad guy.
c26383 +++$+++ You never did answer my question.
c26383 +++$+++ Still playing?
c26383 +++$+++ That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
c26383 +++$+++ Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
c07494 +++$+++ Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
c07494 +++$+++ Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
c07494 +++$+++ We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs.
c04286 +++$+++ God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.
c04286 +++$+++ Huh?
c04286 +++$+++ That stupid hillbilly slut.
c04286 +++$+++ You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
c12447 +++$+++ Jesus, man, can you change the station?
c12447 +++$+++ Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
c12447 +++$+++ I've had a--
c12447 +++$+++ I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
c12447 +++$+++ That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
c24234 +++$+++ Typical male.
c24234 +++$+++ Typical male.
c24234 +++$+++ Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
c09240 +++$+++ Is there a reward in this?
c09240 +++$+++ Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
c09240 +++$+++ Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
c09240 +++$+++ Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
c09240 +++$+++ Hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... You want my opinion, it's the girl. She had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
c09240 +++$+++ Hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
c02348 +++$+++ Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
c02348 +++$+++ I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
c02348 +++$+++ What other job you got?
c02348 +++$+++ Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
c02348 +++$+++ That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
c02348 +++$+++ Then you don't wanna work hard?
c02348 +++$+++ I don't wanna work at all.
c02348 +++$+++ In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
c02348 +++$+++ I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
c02348 +++$+++ Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
c02348 +++$+++ Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
c02348 +++$+++ 'At's-a fine.
c02915 +++$+++ Administration, Ensign Blondell.
c02915 +++$+++ Don't say my name.
c02915 +++$+++ Who's...  Lieuten --
c02915 +++$+++ Or rank.  But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
c02915 +++$+++ "Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
c25683 +++$+++ I wanted to say goodbye to you.
c25683 +++$+++ Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba.
c25683 +++$+++ But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
c25683 +++$+++ No.
c25683 +++$+++ You've <u>never</u> been in Venice?
c25683 +++$+++ No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
c25683 +++$+++ No.
c25683 +++$+++ Amsterdam?
c25683 +++$+++ No.
c25683 +++$+++ Constantinople?
c25683 +++$+++ No.
c25683 +++$+++ You've never been in Constantinople?
c25683 +++$+++ No!
c25683 +++$+++ But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
c25683 +++$+++ Yes!
c25683 +++$+++ Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
c25683 +++$+++ But--
c25683 +++$+++ I don't care <u>what</u> you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
c25683 +++$+++ <u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
c26407 +++$+++ What's the matter?
c26407 +++$+++ You didn't hear something?
c26407 +++$+++ There's someone in the house.
c09331 +++$+++ There are Agency regulations about this.
c09331 +++$+++ "Intra-Agency fraternizing."
c09331 +++$+++ It's a no-no.
c09331 +++$+++ I know.
c09331 +++$+++ I've been thinking about this.
c09331 +++$+++ Does Koessler ask about me?
c09331 +++$+++ He's called a couple times.
c09331 +++$+++ What did you tell him?
c09331 +++$+++ Just routine stuff.
c09331 +++$+++ Not yet. Not about this, either.
c01922 +++$+++ It's been a long time.
c01922 +++$+++ Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
c01922 +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
c06724 +++$+++ Pretty good, too. Lots of detail. Nothing hard core. Old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
c06724 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c06724 +++$+++ I wondered what happened to her...
c25766 +++$+++ A little.
c25766 +++$+++ Sorry.
c25766 +++$+++ Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
c16884 +++$+++ Who died?
c16884 +++$+++ The Mission Director.
c16884 +++$+++ They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
c00098 +++$+++ Who did cause and origin?
c00098 +++$+++ Who do you think, Chief?!
c00098 +++$+++ 'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
c06713 +++$+++ I guess you saw the show...?
c06713 +++$+++ Which show was that?
c06713 +++$+++ Sofie...
c06713 +++$+++ You probably got the idea.
c06233 +++$+++ No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
c06233 +++$+++ It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
c06233 +++$+++ Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
c06233 +++$+++ You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
c20421 +++$+++ There is one other matter.
c20421 +++$+++ What is it?
c20421 +++$+++ I have a letter, ma'am.
c20421 +++$+++ From whom?
c20421 +++$+++ My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
c26842 +++$+++ ...who is this guy...?
c26842 +++$+++ Act Two:  and then, Act Two...
c26842 +++$+++ We don't need an Act Two.
c26842 +++$+++ And get me the Fad King.  No.  Get him First...  We don't need an Act Two?
c26842 +++$+++ We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
c26842 +++$+++ It's a teaser, absolutely right,
c09264 +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering. I killed Iris too, didn't I?
c09264 +++$+++ That's right.  They'll find the original of her snuff clip in your apartment.  The one I left for you at the club was a copy.
c09264 +++$+++ You bet.  Did you like it?
c25927 +++$+++ I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker, you ought to ask or you should have asked Emory and Chick.
c25927 +++$+++ Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
c25927 +++$+++ Those boys never did have good luck.
c25927 +++$+++ Emory had made a lot of enemies. He had a big mouth.
c08787 +++$+++ The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
c08787 +++$+++ Oh, some shit.
c08787 +++$+++ You don't want to hear about it.
c27138 +++$+++ I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
c27138 +++$+++ Where's Lombardo?
c27138 +++$+++ He's leaving the country.  And I don't give a shit.
c27138 +++$+++ It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it.  I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track...
c15670 +++$+++ Say you're sick.
c15670 +++$+++ What?  No!
c15670 +++$+++ Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
c15670 +++$+++ I can't work.  I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
c26677 +++$+++ Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
c26677 +++$+++ Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
c26677 +++$+++ You go home!
c23710 +++$+++ Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
c23710 +++$+++ Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
c23710 +++$+++ Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
c27317 +++$+++ No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
c27317 +++$+++ Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
c27317 +++$+++ I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
c27317 +++$+++ I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
c27317 +++$+++ Old?
c27317 +++$+++ Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.  Here, you pick one.
c27317 +++$+++ Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
c04128 +++$+++ I'll never forget the look on that Papal commander's face when his "heretic stronghold" turned out to be a rock full of whores climbing all over Neuvich.
c04128 +++$+++ Neuvich, the clown of the crusades.
c04128 +++$+++ Offered the Pope one of his whores.
c10798 +++$+++ Jesus, Lindsey--
c10798 +++$+++ Bud, something really important is happening here.
c10798 +++$+++ Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!
c22056 +++$+++ Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
c22056 +++$+++ I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
c22056 +++$+++ Yes, Ma'am.
c04045 +++$+++ Look, are you coming or not?
c04045 +++$+++ Yes, of course.
c04045 +++$+++ Sure.  I'll see you on Friday.
c05573 +++$+++ There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
c05573 +++$+++ I don't want it on me.
c05573 +++$+++ Its powers are strong.
c05573 +++$+++ Do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood?
c25502 +++$+++ You know, we know each other.
c25502 +++$+++ Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
c25502 +++$+++ Aren't you Nick Charles?
c25502 +++$+++ You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
c02238 +++$+++ I think we should try sneaking in.
c02238 +++$+++ Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
c02238 +++$+++ Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
c20599 +++$+++ Hi.
c20599 +++$+++ Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
c20599 +++$+++ Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
c20599 +++$+++ Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
c20599 +++$+++ Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
c20599 +++$+++ No kidding?
c10237 +++$+++ Well, there it is; the Last Resort.  Sure you wanna go in?
c10237 +++$+++ Why not?
c10237 +++$+++ And you get a kickback.
c04743 +++$+++ Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
c04743 +++$+++ I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
c04743 +++$+++ You ought to know why. Because--
c04743 +++$+++ Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because--
c04743 +++$+++ Because marrying that fool King Westley is--
c04743 +++$+++ Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
c17358 +++$+++ Hello, Sean.
c17358 +++$+++ Come in.
c17358 +++$+++ Me too.
c02151 +++$+++ Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
c02151 +++$+++ Energy shielding positive function.
c02151 +++$+++ Swell. Let's synchronize detonation time. Do you know when you're supposed to go off?
c02151 +++$+++ Detonation in six minutes, twenty seconds.
c02151 +++$+++ All right, I have detonation time at... Wait a minute, something's wrong with the clock.  All right, I have detonation time at... no, that can't be right, it says three years.  Okay, I have six minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?
c02151 +++$+++ Arm yourself, bomb.
c07090 +++$+++ Why, you got a customer?
c07090 +++$+++ The White House.
c07090 +++$+++ You're fucking me.
c07090 +++$+++ We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
c07090 +++$+++ A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
c19091 +++$+++ Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game.  They should be here by four.
c19091 +++$+++ Okay.
c19091 +++$+++ Good idea.
c08030 +++$+++ You motherfucker.
c08030 +++$+++ Nick, no --
c08030 +++$+++ You sold him out.
c08030 +++$+++ Nick --
c08030 +++$+++ Nick, what are you --
c20381 +++$+++ What's your name?
c20381 +++$+++ Mary Taylor, sir.
c20381 +++$+++ Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
c20381 +++$+++ You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
c09758 +++$+++ Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
c09758 +++$+++ How can you die if you're already dead?
c09758 +++$+++ I was talking about you.
c20881 +++$+++ What is with this school and prom?
c20881 +++$+++ Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
c20881 +++$+++ This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
c01428 +++$+++ ... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
c01428 +++$+++ -- I should tear your head off.
c01428 +++$+++ -- Hey, I got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
c25219 +++$+++ Well?
c25219 +++$+++ What?
c25219 +++$+++ How was your trip?
c25219 +++$+++ Okay... Who'd you meet?
c09947 +++$+++ Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
c09947 +++$+++ What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
c09947 +++$+++ Well, you belong in one.
c16758 +++$+++ When are you going to stop treating me like one!
c16758 +++$+++ When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
c16758 +++$+++ You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
c12818 +++$+++ Did you always want to be a lawyer?
c12818 +++$+++ No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
c12818 +++$+++ Really?
c12818 +++$+++ Yeah.
c12818 +++$+++ That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
c12818 +++$+++ It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it?  To let go of what you want?
c18332 +++$+++ Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
c18332 +++$+++ That shirt?
c18332 +++$+++ Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
c11543 +++$+++ Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
c11543 +++$+++ I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
c11543 +++$+++ I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
c11543 +++$+++ Sure, sure.  Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
c11543 +++$+++ Mr. Sheldrake?
c11543 +++$+++ That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
c11543 +++$+++ You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
c11543 +++$+++ I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
c11543 +++$+++ Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
c11543 +++$+++ I'll pay you on Friday.  And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
c11578 +++$+++ Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
c11578 +++$+++ What gives?
c11578 +++$+++ A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
c11578 +++$+++ Go where?
c11578 +++$+++ What's your mother doing this afternoon?
c11578 +++$+++ She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
c11578 +++$+++ That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
c19313 +++$+++ Your boy, there--
c19313 +++$+++ Amado.
c19313 +++$+++ Nice-looking kid.
c19313 +++$+++ He hates me.
c19313 +++$+++ No--
c19313 +++$+++ With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
c19313 +++$+++ Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
c19313 +++$+++ It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.
c16733 +++$+++ Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
c16733 +++$+++ April 16...?  That means she was the first.
c16733 +++$+++ This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
c15651 +++$+++ We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
c15651 +++$+++ We believe?
c15651 +++$+++ Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
c15651 +++$+++ Lyle?!
c15651 +++$+++ Yes sir.
c15651 +++$+++ You're kidding me.
c15651 +++$+++ No sir.
c15651 +++$+++ Dean's with Lyle.
c15651 +++$+++ And they have the video. That's confirmed.
c15651 +++$+++ So they know everything.
c15651 +++$+++ If they've looked at the video.
c15651 +++$+++ Oh, let's assume that they have.
c15651 +++$+++ Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
c18076 +++$+++ What do you want?
c18076 +++$+++ My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
c18076 +++$+++ I think you got no choice.
c25094 +++$+++ Hello, Harry.
c25094 +++$+++ Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
c25094 +++$+++ Listen...
c25094 +++$+++ Yes.
c25094 +++$+++ Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
c24436 +++$+++ Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
c24436 +++$+++ Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
c24436 +++$+++ Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
c24436 +++$+++ Please, as a favour to me? So I won't  be the only girl?
c14253 +++$+++ Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
c14253 +++$+++ I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
c14253 +++$+++ Sure?  Like you didn't play him? String him along?  If he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
c24465 +++$+++ I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
c24465 +++$+++ Or socks.
c24465 +++$+++ 'Cause I know about getting' them half-centses?
c13580 +++$+++ I'm here.  Where are you?
c13580 +++$+++ We don't see you.
c13580 +++$+++ I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
c13580 +++$+++ Stay there.
c13580 +++$+++ I don't want you within two hundred feet.  Park down by the lifeguard station.  Nobody gets out.
c13580 +++$+++ It's your call.
c13580 +++$+++ Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
c13580 +++$+++ Just relax.
c13580 +++$+++ I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
c13580 +++$+++ You'll see her.
c13580 +++$+++ Talk to the man.
c19492 +++$+++ Forget Tonya Randall.
c19492 +++$+++ I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
c19492 +++$+++ Then prove her wrong.
c19492 +++$+++ So you're gonna act salty all night?
c22536 +++$+++ I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
c22536 +++$+++ What?
c22536 +++$+++ You know.
c22536 +++$+++ What?
c22536 +++$+++ Magic.  It was magic.
c22536 +++$+++ Magic.
c22536 +++$+++ I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
c22536 +++$+++ Mom!
c22536 +++$+++ Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
c22536 +++$+++ Mom, we already...
c22536 +++$+++ Like... clockwork.
c22594 +++$+++ We've got to have a talk, you and me.
c22594 +++$+++ All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
c22594 +++$+++ Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
c07712 +++$+++ I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
c07712 +++$+++ Sure.
c07712 +++$+++ Do you want to pick me up?
c07712 +++$+++ Sure.
c07712 +++$+++ Sure.
c13274 +++$+++ Ow.
c13274 +++$+++ Cramps?
c13274 +++$+++ This is it.
c24802 +++$+++ I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
c24802 +++$+++ What's all this for?
c24802 +++$+++ We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
c24802 +++$+++ No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
c24802 +++$+++ Oh... it's a game.
c24802 +++$+++ A game?
c24802 +++$+++ Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
c24802 +++$+++ What kind of vacation?
c24802 +++$+++ It's different every time.
c24802 +++$+++ Humor me with specifics.
c24802 +++$+++ We provide whatever's lacking.
c24802 +++$+++ And if nothing's lacking?
c24802 +++$+++ May I make two suggestions... ?
c24802 +++$+++ First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.  Second, you don't have to decide today.  Take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  One day, the game begins.  You either love it or hate it.  Decide then.  We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  That was my sales pitch.
c18983 +++$+++ Is this really your desk?
c18983 +++$+++ Yep.
c18983 +++$+++ Is that really your chair?
c18983 +++$+++ Uh huh...
c18983 +++$+++ Sure.
c09797 +++$+++ I'm sure you recognize from our broad- casts the evil forces that have produced the tension in our world. Surely you would agree--
c09797 +++$+++ I am not concerned, Mr. Harley, with the internal affairs of your planet. I consider that to be your business -- not mine.
c09797 +++$+++ I was only hoping to make you understand.
c09797 +++$+++ My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
c09797 +++$+++ I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
c20451 +++$+++ I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
c20451 +++$+++ Yes, he is. He raises corn.
c20451 +++$+++ Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
c20451 +++$+++ You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."
c13903 +++$+++ You and your husband never discussed her?
c13903 +++$+++ He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name.  We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
c13903 +++$+++ A complete surprise?
c13903 +++$+++ Yes.
c13903 +++$+++ But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
c13903 +++$+++ A private investigator?
c13903 +++$+++ Well yes.
c09678 +++$+++ Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
c09678 +++$+++ I got them all, Mother.
c09678 +++$+++ When do you think they'll come?
c09678 +++$+++ I don't know.
c09678 +++$+++ If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
c09678 +++$+++ That's a chance we have to take.
c09678 +++$+++ Maybe we ought to leave.
c09678 +++$+++ Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
c09678 +++$+++ When?
c09678 +++$+++ I don't know when.  We'll see what...
c09678 +++$+++ Where will we go?
c09678 +++$+++ What happens when we run out of wood?
c26115 +++$+++ It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
c26115 +++$+++ The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
c26115 +++$+++ Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
c26115 +++$+++ It grows on you.
c19710 +++$+++ You got the message Lecktor called...
c19710 +++$+++ I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
c19710 +++$+++ From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning.
c19710 +++$+++ What's it narrow down to?
c19710 +++$+++ Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit.
c19710 +++$+++ That's narrow?
c19710 +++$+++ When I'm done.
c16638 +++$+++ Now that we've broken the ice...
c16638 +++$+++ I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
c16638 +++$+++ But how did you know?  Here, take this picture...
c09379 +++$+++ And what if I don't want to give up on her?
c09379 +++$+++ You don't call.
c09379 +++$+++ But you said I shouldn't call if I wanted to give up on her.
c09379 +++$+++ Right.
c09379 +++$+++ So I don't call either way.
c09379 +++$+++ Right.
c09379 +++$+++ So what's the difference?
c09379 +++$+++ The only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. See, you can't do anything to make her want to come back. You can only do things to make her not want to come back.
c09379 +++$+++ So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
c09379 +++$+++ Right.
c09379 +++$+++ Well that sucks.
c09379 +++$+++ It sucks.
c09379 +++$+++ So it's almost a retroactive decision. So I could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like I just pretended to forget about her.
c09379 +++$+++ Right... or more likely the opposite.
c09379 +++$+++ Right... Wait, what do you mean?
c09379 +++$+++ I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
c09379 +++$+++ Unless she comes back first.
c09379 +++$+++ Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
c09379 +++$+++ There's the rub.
c09379 +++$+++ There's the rub.
c09379 +++$+++ Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
c09379 +++$+++ Hey man, don't sweat it.
c09379 +++$+++ ...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
c09379 +++$+++ No problem.
c09379 +++$+++ Thanks. Thanks, man.
c10546 +++$+++ What are we supposed to talk about?
c10546 +++$+++ You've gotta be kidding?
c10546 +++$+++ There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
c14148 +++$+++ If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
c14148 +++$+++ He doesn't want my help.
c14148 +++$+++ That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
c14148 +++$+++ He can handle it.
c14148 +++$+++ What if he can't?
c14148 +++$+++ You mean the nerve.
c01093 +++$+++ Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
c01093 +++$+++ Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
c01093 +++$+++ Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
c01093 +++$+++ Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
c01093 +++$+++ Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
c01093 +++$+++ Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
c22676 +++$+++ They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
c22676 +++$+++ Nope.
c22676 +++$+++ Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
c22676 +++$+++ Three for three.
c22676 +++$+++ If we stayed, we could make a difference.
c22676 +++$+++ You never know.
c24853 +++$+++ Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
c24853 +++$+++ Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
c24853 +++$+++ He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
c24853 +++$+++ And that's where you met Jenny.
c24853 +++$+++ No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
c24853 +++$+++ Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
c22686 +++$+++ I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.
c22686 +++$+++ Why's that?
c22686 +++$+++ Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
c22686 +++$+++ Except for the last part, that one's not bad.
c22686 +++$+++ B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
c22686 +++$+++ I don't like that one.
c22686 +++$+++ Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
c22686 +++$+++ But we accomplish the mission.
c22686 +++$+++ Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
c22686 +++$+++ Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
c22686 +++$+++ That's a mystery to me.
c19765 +++$+++ I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
c19765 +++$+++ So who's gonna pay for it?
c19765 +++$+++ Tony Clifton.
c19765 +++$+++ Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony better than you do.  Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!
c01717 +++$+++ What the fuck is going on here?
c01717 +++$+++ What. What's the matter?
c01717 +++$+++ Anthony, we're on the run from the law here. Did you tell these people your real name?
c01717 +++$+++ No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
c01717 +++$+++ They don't?
c01717 +++$+++ No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
c01717 +++$+++ On the left.
c05954 +++$+++ Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
c05954 +++$+++ Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
c05954 +++$+++ This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
c05954 +++$+++ Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
c05954 +++$+++ Somebody named Leo Crow.
c05954 +++$+++ And who the hell is that?
c05954 +++$+++ I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
c05954 +++$+++ All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
c05954 +++$+++ I'm out of breath!  I'm a fucking fugitive!
c05954 +++$+++ Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
c05954 +++$+++ I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
c05954 +++$+++ How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
c05954 +++$+++ Can you fake the cerebral output?
c05954 +++$+++ We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
c05954 +++$+++ John.  Just tell me, who's Leo Crow?
c07740 +++$+++ What's up?
c07740 +++$+++ I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
c07740 +++$+++ ....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
c27022 +++$+++ Harder...
c27022 +++$+++ Rowan...
c27022 +++$+++ Harder...
c27022 +++$+++ Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
c27022 +++$+++ Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
c16336 +++$+++ We need to talk.
c16336 +++$+++ Sure.
c16336 +++$+++ I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
c16336 +++$+++ Okay, in the Sylvia Plath philosophy way, we're all dying.  But you're not dying the way Chloe is dying.
c05812 +++$+++ You don't look so good.
c05812 +++$+++ I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
c05812 +++$+++ The police called us.
c05812 +++$+++ Yeah? what did they want?
c05812 +++$+++ But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
c19255 +++$+++ It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
c19255 +++$+++ There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
c19255 +++$+++ That's not the point.
c19255 +++$+++ You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
c19255 +++$+++ You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail, son.
c16786 +++$+++ Steven!
c16786 +++$+++ She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
c16786 +++$+++ I'm literally going to kill you!
c16786 +++$+++ A pizza?!
c17935 +++$+++ Bernie, how'sa kid?
c17935 +++$+++ You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
c17935 +++$+++ You couldn't have a problem, Chick, because I personally have got them all.  I cornered the whole goddamn market.  You wouldn't believe... Oh, how ya doin'...?
c08148 +++$+++ I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
c08148 +++$+++ Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
c08148 +++$+++ Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
c05254 +++$+++ You know what I want to do?
c05254 +++$+++ Yeah.
c05254 +++$+++ What do I want to do?
c05254 +++$+++ You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
c05254 +++$+++ Why?
c05254 +++$+++ Because, you know why. You know.
c05254 +++$+++ Because your a virgin?
c05254 +++$+++ Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
c05254 +++$+++ You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
c05254 +++$+++ Why is that?
c05254 +++$+++ Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
c05254 +++$+++ I wouldn't believe it?
c05254 +++$+++ I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
c05254 +++$+++ What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  I want to make you happy. That's all.
c09567 +++$+++ Yeah.
c09567 +++$+++ Could you see anything?
c09567 +++$+++ Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
c09567 +++$+++ What did you do?
c09567 +++$+++ Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- What do you think!  What do I have to do? Draw you a picture?
c09567 +++$+++ What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic.  So howsit?
c15211 +++$+++ Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
c15211 +++$+++ Wake up!
c15211 +++$+++ Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
c15211 +++$+++ It's gonna be hot today.
c15211 +++$+++ Good!  Leave me alone when I'm sleeping.  I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
c15211 +++$+++ Don't ya love ya brother Mookie anymore?  I loves ya, Jade.
c15211 +++$+++ Later.  Gotta get paid.
c23370 +++$+++ Why would you do such a thing?
c23370 +++$+++ No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
c23370 +++$+++ I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
c23370 +++$+++ You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
c23370 +++$+++ What are you on about?
c23370 +++$+++ The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
c23370 +++$+++ Must I hear this?
c23370 +++$+++ There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
c23370 +++$+++ And this gives worth to butchery?
c23370 +++$+++ It was not butchery.
c23370 +++$+++ What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest?
c23370 +++$+++ I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it.
c23370 +++$+++ Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
c23370 +++$+++ But, why?  Tell me why.
c03489 +++$+++ And you were a student also.
c03489 +++$+++ Yes.
c03489 +++$+++ At college.
c03489 +++$+++ Yes.
c03489 +++$+++ What was your major?
c03489 +++$+++ Why are you asking me all this?
c03489 +++$+++ Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
c03489 +++$+++ Art?
c13466 +++$+++ I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere -
c13466 +++$+++ Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just -
c13466 +++$+++ What? What?
c13466 +++$+++ Nothin'.
c13466 +++$+++ What were you gonna say? Go ahead.
c13466 +++$+++ I don't -
c13466 +++$+++ Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
c13466 +++$+++ Yeah?
c13466 +++$+++ Yeah.
c13466 +++$+++ Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
c13466 +++$+++ Let me think about that.
c13466 +++$+++ Okay.
c13466 +++$+++ See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust.
c13466 +++$+++ Mm-hm.
c13466 +++$+++ You know?
c13466 +++$+++ Yeah. 'Cause, you know,  He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
c13466 +++$+++ Hm.
c13466 +++$+++ Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too.
c11598 +++$+++ I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
c11598 +++$+++ Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
c11598 +++$+++ Let's go.
c04747 +++$+++ Ellie--
c04747 +++$+++ Oh, hello, Dad.
c04747 +++$+++ I knocked several times.
c04747 +++$+++ Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming.
c04747 +++$+++ Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
c04747 +++$+++ Stunt?
c04747 +++$+++ Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
c04747 +++$+++ Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
c13482 +++$+++ Wow.
c13482 +++$+++ Boy, look at this place, huh?
c13482 +++$+++ All right.
c18571 +++$+++ Where the hell is Air One?
c18571 +++$+++ That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
c18571 +++$+++ Did he raise the Kids?
c18571 +++$+++ Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
c18571 +++$+++ Yeah?  Then what?
c18571 +++$+++ Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
c18571 +++$+++ Did you say Cable Junction?
c18571 +++$+++ That's what he said.
c18571 +++$+++ 1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
c13825 +++$+++ I'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
c13825 +++$+++ That's...
c13825 +++$+++ ...fine.
c13825 +++$+++ Shut up.
c01008 +++$+++ Not quite. This is my field.
c01008 +++$+++ Is there anything that isn't?
c01008 +++$+++ The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
c01008 +++$+++ Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
c01008 +++$+++ Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
c01008 +++$+++ But if someone miniaturized the process...
c01008 +++$+++ Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
c24684 +++$+++ No!
c24684 +++$+++ I'm sorry, John.
c24684 +++$+++ No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
c24684 +++$+++ Don't do it.  Please... don't go --
c07220 +++$+++ Did you watch it yet?
c07220 +++$+++ Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
c07220 +++$+++ Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
c07220 +++$+++ Oh, Betty --
c07220 +++$+++ I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
c07220 +++$+++ Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
c07220 +++$+++ I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
c02409 +++$+++ Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
c02409 +++$+++ Yes, very soon.
c02409 +++$+++ Splendid. it's truly a masterpiece. Well, I suppose I'll be on my way now. I hoped your enjoyed yourself this evening.
c02409 +++$+++ I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
c20898 +++$+++ God, I can't do this.
c20898 +++$+++ Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
c20898 +++$+++ Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
c09791 +++$+++ Go to the movies.
c09791 +++$+++ All right.
c09791 +++$+++ Certainly.  Tell me, Bobby -- do you have to have money to go there?
c00182 +++$+++ We don't wash 'em, ya know.
c00182 +++$+++ How about chargin' the battery?
c00182 +++$+++ Great, just great.
c02433 +++$+++ What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
c02433 +++$+++ Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
c02433 +++$+++ You don't think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
c02433 +++$+++ Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
c02433 +++$+++ A lot of people like our singing.
c02433 +++$+++ I'm sure it's lovely.
c02433 +++$+++ No... no...  We'd love to hear it. Wouldn't we?
c09092 +++$+++ ATR setting...
c09092 +++$+++ Active.
c09092 +++$+++ Main bus...
c09092 +++$+++ Initiate pre-ignition sequence.
c16200 +++$+++ What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
c16200 +++$+++ I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
c16200 +++$+++ Well maybe <u>you</u> should date him.
c26988 +++$+++ You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
c26988 +++$+++ I felt you...looking through me...
c26988 +++$+++ You told me that I was...
c10139 +++$+++ Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
c10139 +++$+++ Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
c10139 +++$+++ Captain, belay that order!  Bob, where's that coming from!
c10139 +++$+++ Will somebody find out what's going on?!
c19922 +++$+++ I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
c19922 +++$+++ I am, too.
c19922 +++$+++ Has her pain abated?
c19922 +++$+++ I'm sorry to hear that.
c19590 +++$+++ And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
c19590 +++$+++ I don't how much I went -- but I was enrolled.  I was such a loser back then. I was -- misguided, pathetic -- I was very fat. Not even close to what I am today. Not the Frank TJ Mackey you're eager to talk to because I was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to I <u>wanted</u>.
c19590 +++$+++ Where does that name come from?
c19590 +++$+++ What name?  My name?
c19590 +++$+++ It's not your given name, right?
c19590 +++$+++ My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
c19590 +++$+++ And "Frank?"
c19590 +++$+++ "Frank" was my mother's father.
c19590 +++$+++ Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
c19590 +++$+++ Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
c19590 +++$+++ They wouldn't?
c19590 +++$+++ no, no, no.  Certainly not.  I wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. Was that unclear?
c19590 +++$+++ I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
c27409 +++$+++ I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
c27409 +++$+++ Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
c27409 +++$+++ That's a tough choice.
c27409 +++$+++ Is it worth taking a chance?
c27409 +++$+++ Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
c07431 +++$+++ My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
c07431 +++$+++ My pleasure, sir.
c07431 +++$+++ Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
c07431 +++$+++ Apology accepted.
c07431 +++$+++ Thank you, Colonel... I'm afraid I don't know your name.
c07431 +++$+++ As you wish.
c18054 +++$+++ Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
c18054 +++$+++ You think we should take that chance?
c18054 +++$+++ I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
c26906 +++$+++ What if I have a previous engagement?
c26906 +++$+++ Break it.
c26906 +++$+++ You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you.
c17103 +++$+++ Where are you going?
c17103 +++$+++ To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
c17103 +++$+++ Aren't you going out today?
c17103 +++$+++ With what?  With what, John, they took the leads...
c17103 +++$+++ Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
c11589 +++$+++ That's good gin.
c11589 +++$+++ I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
c11589 +++$+++ Delta ?
c11589 +++$+++ No.
c11589 +++$+++ North ?
c11589 +++$+++ Yeah. Way north.
c11589 +++$+++ What unit were you with ?
c11589 +++$+++ None.
c11589 +++$+++ Sort of.
c10523 +++$+++ Why'd you do it?
c10523 +++$+++ What's the difference?
c10523 +++$+++ Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
c16511 +++$+++ We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
c16511 +++$+++ Am I on TV?
c16511 +++$+++ Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
c19729 +++$+++ He's very strong physically.
c19729 +++$+++ That's true.
c19729 +++$+++ He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
c19729 +++$+++ Describe exactly what you think he did to Mrs. Leeds and I'll tell you if you're right or not.
c19729 +++$+++ Goodbye.
c10094 +++$+++ So who's the lucky guy?
c10094 +++$+++ Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
c10094 +++$+++ He's no Steve Young.
c09343 +++$+++ Jaime --
c09343 +++$+++ It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
c09343 +++$+++ Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
c09343 +++$+++ Get the routes of all refrigerated trucks over the last ten years. We've got three disappearance cities and dates, three parallel discovery cities. Get into the mainframe, let it crunch this information.
c15674 +++$+++ Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
c15674 +++$+++ We've got to get you out of here.
c15674 +++$+++ I know, darling, I'm sorry.
c05851 +++$+++ Wait a minute. Is it a good morning? Say, we're supposed to be traveling east, aren't we?
c05851 +++$+++ Why, of course. Yes.
c05851 +++$+++ Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
c05851 +++$+++ That's ridiculous.
c05851 +++$+++ Is it?
c05851 +++$+++ It certainly is.
c05851 +++$+++ Look here--
c05851 +++$+++ Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south--
c05851 +++$+++ I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
c05851 +++$+++ Oh, really?
c05851 +++$+++ Yes.
c05851 +++$+++ Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is--  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
c05851 +++$+++ Now you're irritating and absurd!
c20739 +++$+++ Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not <u>the</u> greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
c20739 +++$+++ That's what Tim said.
c20739 +++$+++ Yes, I would.
c03355 +++$+++ He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
c03355 +++$+++ Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
c03355 +++$+++ Can't you tell me now?
c03355 +++$+++ I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
c03355 +++$+++ You must have gotten the last copy.
c03355 +++$+++ Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
c03355 +++$+++ Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
c03355 +++$+++ "Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
c03355 +++$+++ What's he doing in my refrigerator.
c03355 +++$+++ I'm checking on that.  I think we should meet Thursday night at nine to talk about it.
c03355 +++$+++ I don't think so.  I'm busy Thursday night.
c03355 +++$+++ You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
c03355 +++$+++ All right.  Since you put it that way.
c03355 +++$+++ I've got to go now.
c17668 +++$+++ You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
c17668 +++$+++ Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
c17668 +++$+++ Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
c24636 +++$+++ Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
c24636 +++$+++ Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
c24636 +++$+++ You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
c24636 +++$+++ Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
c24636 +++$+++ Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
c21710 +++$+++ We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
c21710 +++$+++ Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
c21710 +++$+++ Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
c20121 +++$+++ You feel anything?
c20121 +++$+++ Yeah, I feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
c20121 +++$+++ Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
c20121 +++$+++ I'm sorry.  But I don't think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
c07201 +++$+++ I thought you said the eggs weren't...
c07201 +++$+++ It's fine. Mind your own meal...
c07201 +++$+++ And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
c00189 +++$+++ You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
c00189 +++$+++ Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
c00189 +++$+++ You're gonna help us take him.
c00189 +++$+++ He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
c04311 +++$+++ I want our boy back.
c04311 +++$+++ Oui.
c04311 +++$+++ That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
c04311 +++$+++ We still have you and I.
c04311 +++$+++ I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back.
c04311 +++$+++ Where do we look for little lost Puff?
c04311 +++$+++ I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
c04311 +++$+++ You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!
c20203 +++$+++ An idea, yeah.
c20203 +++$+++ Like?
c20203 +++$+++ Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
c05218 +++$+++ ...And all I'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them. That's all.
c05218 +++$+++ You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
c05218 +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it.
c06369 +++$+++ You know the ten commandments?
c06369 +++$+++ Yes.
c06369 +++$+++ Thou shall have no other God before me.
c06929 +++$+++ I'm hungry.
c06929 +++$+++ Why, sure. And there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
c06929 +++$+++ Can I have my supper please?
c06929 +++$+++ Naturally.
c06929 +++$+++ Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
c12227 +++$+++ She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
c12227 +++$+++ Won't?  Or can't?
c12227 +++$+++ Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
c12227 +++$+++ At least we won't have to worry about her.
c23266 +++$+++ I'll bring back a doctor.
c23266 +++$+++ Wendy...
c23266 +++$+++ Wendy...
c10474 +++$+++ Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
c10474 +++$+++ Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
c10474 +++$+++ Very futuristic.  Yours doesn't really go with that butch haircut!
c10474 +++$+++ I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
c10474 +++$+++ My kid brother has one.  You know why?
c10474 +++$+++ Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
c10474 +++$+++ That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
c02101 +++$+++ How about fifteen hundred?
c02101 +++$+++ How about five hundred.
c02101 +++$+++ What?!
c02101 +++$+++ How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
c02101 +++$+++ Is that your idea of arithmetic?
c02101 +++$+++ I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
c02101 +++$+++ Seven-fifty.
c02381 +++$+++ Our man is sick. Come right away.
c02381 +++$+++ What is it?
c02381 +++$+++ I'll get my bag.
c23558 +++$+++ You all right?
c23558 +++$+++ I'm fine.
c23558 +++$+++ Half-full.
c11532 +++$+++ Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
c11532 +++$+++ Yes, of course.
c11532 +++$+++ You know how people talk.
c11532 +++$+++ Oh, you don't have to worry --
c11532 +++$+++ Not that I have anything to hide.
c11532 +++$+++ Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
c11532 +++$+++ You too, sir.
c00496 +++$+++ Can't you take a guess?
c00496 +++$+++ Well...not for another two hours.
c00496 +++$+++ No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
c25921 +++$+++ Good morning.
c25921 +++$+++ You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
c25921 +++$+++ Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
c25921 +++$+++ I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
c25921 +++$+++ Well, I would appreciate that.
c18963 +++$+++ -- Usual case history -- this isn't a medical confidence, it's all of them -- broken family, lonely, confused, crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year.  Oh they don't keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why?  Why do you want to know all this?
c18963 +++$+++ I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
c18963 +++$+++ Not unusual.
c18963 +++$+++ Did she talk about him to you?
c18963 +++$+++ About his letters -- that's all she remembered. Quite violent material, I'd say, obsessive, a quite sick man. But that's not unusual either.
c18963 +++$+++ Has she talked with you since prison?
c18963 +++$+++ No. She had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting herself to an acting career.
c18963 +++$+++ Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life.  But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction.
c27129 +++$+++ Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
c27129 +++$+++ And the child...
c27129 +++$+++ She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
c27129 +++$+++ Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.
c08020 +++$+++ You can't find... what?
c08020 +++$+++ Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
c08020 +++$+++ Toys for... adults?
c08020 +++$+++ C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
c08020 +++$+++ I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
c11561 +++$+++ Say, this is Snugsville.
c11561 +++$+++ Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
c11561 +++$+++ No kidding.
c11561 +++$+++ Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that --  -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
c11561 +++$+++ Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
c11561 +++$+++ I'm with you, lover.
c15681 +++$+++ Good morning!
c15681 +++$+++ Could I trouble you for some water?
c15681 +++$+++ Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
c15681 +++$+++ I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
c15681 +++$+++ I see.
c15681 +++$+++ No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and...  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
c15681 +++$+++ Do you have your papers, sir?
c15681 +++$+++ What?
c15681 +++$+++ If I could just see some identification.
c15681 +++$+++ Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
c15681 +++$+++ Right.  And what's your name, sir?
c15681 +++$+++ Count Laszlo de Almasy. The Officer is writing this down.  A glance at his Corporal.
c15681 +++$+++ Almasy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
c15681 +++$+++ Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
c15681 +++$+++ No!  NO!  Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
c12563 +++$+++ Cotter?
c12563 +++$+++ Fucking owl!
c12563 +++$+++ No idea--goddamitt!
c07113 +++$+++ It makes us human ...
c07113 +++$+++ It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
c07113 +++$+++ We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
c07113 +++$+++ What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
c07113 +++$+++ It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
c07113 +++$+++ Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
c07113 +++$+++ You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
c23779 +++$+++ I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.
c23779 +++$+++ See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
c23779 +++$+++ He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
c13320 +++$+++ Who are you?  Do you have a job?
c13320 +++$+++ I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
c13320 +++$+++ And now you wanta teach me?
c13320 +++$+++ I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
c13320 +++$+++ I doubt that.
c13320 +++$+++ Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
c13320 +++$+++ I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
c13320 +++$+++ I'm ready for a complicated man.
c13320 +++$+++ --and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
c13320 +++$+++ Annie, I think you should leave.
c19028 +++$+++ All quiet?
c19028 +++$+++ Yes, Holiness.
c19028 +++$+++ Where are you from?
c19028 +++$+++ Kham, Holiness.
c19028 +++$+++ Khambas are wild men.
c26659 +++$+++ Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
c26659 +++$+++ Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
c26659 +++$+++ Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
c26659 +++$+++ Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
c26659 +++$+++ Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
c26659 +++$+++ Yeah.
c26659 +++$+++ Pop Leibel.
c26659 +++$+++ Who?
c26659 +++$+++ Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
c01349 +++$+++ It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
c01349 +++$+++ Yes.
c01349 +++$+++ I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
c01349 +++$+++ Yes.
c01349 +++$+++ I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
c01349 +++$+++ I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."
c10246 +++$+++ Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
c10246 +++$+++ I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
c10246 +++$+++ Come on...put his head in place.
c25761 +++$+++ Like her paint job?
c25761 +++$+++ Very much--
c25761 +++$+++ You've got lipstick all over you.
c25761 +++$+++ I could stand some more--
c25761 +++$+++ No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
c25627 +++$+++ Hey, Wes, what kind of treasure you figure these people buried?
c25627 +++$+++ If!  If there's a treasure.
c25627 +++$+++ Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
c25627 +++$+++ I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
c25627 +++$+++ How the hell should I know how much?
c04861 +++$+++ Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
c04861 +++$+++ Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
c04861 +++$+++ It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
c23637 +++$+++ And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?
c23637 +++$+++ Colored.
c23637 +++$+++ Sure--
c25440 +++$+++ Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
c25440 +++$+++ Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
c25440 +++$+++ Don't worry about it, pal.
c17283 +++$+++ This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
c17283 +++$+++ Who's "Eleanor?"
c17283 +++$+++ The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
c17283 +++$+++ All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
c07302 +++$+++ Where's your ring, honey?
c07302 +++$+++ I ain't worn it since our divorce came through. It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin. Never thought I'd need it; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.
c07302 +++$+++ Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
c07302 +++$+++ We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
c07302 +++$+++ Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
c07302 +++$+++ Ain't gonna be no weddin'.
c07302 +++$+++ No weddin'.
c19587 +++$+++ I'm confused about your past is the thing.
c19587 +++$+++ Is that still lingering?
c19587 +++$+++ -- just to clarify --
c19587 +++$+++ So boring, so useless --
c19587 +++$+++ I would just want to clear some things up:
c19587 +++$+++ Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
c19587 +++$+++ This isn't meant --
c19587 +++$+++ -- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
c19587 +++$+++ Are you asking me that?
c19587 +++$+++ Yes.
c19587 +++$+++ Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
c19587 +++$+++ In aid of what?
c19587 +++$+++ I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
c19587 +++$+++ -- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
c19587 +++$+++ It's all important --
c19587 +++$+++ Not really.
c19587 +++$+++ It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
c19587 +++$+++ This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
c19587 +++$+++ We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
c19587 +++$+++ I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
c19587 +++$+++ Do you remember a Miss Simms?
c19587 +++$+++ I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
c19587 +++$+++ She does.  From when you were a boy.
c19587 +++$+++ Mm. Hm.
c19587 +++$+++ She lived in Tarzana.
c19587 +++$+++ An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
c19587 +++$+++ No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
c19587 +++$+++ Go ahead and waste your time.
c19587 +++$+++ I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
c19587 +++$+++ I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
c21516 +++$+++ Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
c21516 +++$+++ Do you have any weapons?
c21516 +++$+++ Just the same, I want one.
c11905 +++$+++ What a nice place.
c11905 +++$+++ Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
c11905 +++$+++ It's your play.
c24363 +++$+++ What's the matter, Norma?
c24363 +++$+++ Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
c24363 +++$+++ We've missed you too, dear.
c24363 +++$+++ We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
c24363 +++$+++ That's what I want to talk to you about.
c24363 +++$+++ It's a good script, isn't it?
c24363 +++$+++ It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
c24363 +++$+++ I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
c24363 +++$+++ But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
c06870 +++$+++ Elroy, what happen?
c06870 +++$+++ I threw my back, again.
c06870 +++$+++ Aw, no lovin' tonight?
c06870 +++$+++ Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
c06870 +++$+++ For what?  We ain't gonna have no house after the auction tomorrow!
c04134 +++$+++ My condolences.
c04134 +++$+++ Where were you Tuesday night?
c04134 +++$+++ Home.
c04134 +++$+++ He's mistaken.
c11521 +++$+++ Are you all right?
c11521 +++$+++ I'm fine.
c11521 +++$+++ Are you sure? How's your knee?
c11521 +++$+++ I'm fine all over.
c11521 +++$+++ Of course not.
c18320 +++$+++ You wanted to warn me...
c18320 +++$+++ The night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me, to help me -- I turned you away.
c18320 +++$+++ Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
c18320 +++$+++ I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
c18320 +++$+++ That's past -- that's over and done with...
c18320 +++$+++ I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
c18320 +++$+++ Yes.
c24079 +++$+++ Mommy?  It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
c24079 +++$+++ No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
c24079 +++$+++ Rachel's job is she works.
c24079 +++$+++ Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
c24079 +++$+++ Does Rachel make a lot of money?
c24079 +++$+++ People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
c24079 +++$+++ I think she's pretty, Mommy.
c24079 +++$+++ Yes...if you like big hair...
c24079 +++$+++ Mommy?
c24079 +++$+++ If you want me to hate her I will.
c05736 +++$+++ I didn't murder anybody
c05736 +++$+++ Look. You were really high. Things happen.
c05736 +++$+++ I think you're looking at him.
c25597 +++$+++ What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
c25597 +++$+++ We're not going to do anything.
c25597 +++$+++ They can't shoot us in here.
c04538 +++$+++ Like the guys that attacked us.
c04538 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c04538 +++$+++ Black suits and helmets.
c04538 +++$+++ That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
c04538 +++$+++ That's not a good idea.
c04538 +++$+++ They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
c04538 +++$+++ Don't know.
c15690 +++$+++ David Caravaggio.
c15690 +++$+++ No.
c15690 +++$+++ I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
c25783 +++$+++ I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
c25783 +++$+++ Oh, yes. On the pier.
c25783 +++$+++ Before that. Your face is very familiar.
c25783 +++$+++ No--not quite.
c04017 +++$+++ Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
c04017 +++$+++ Pardon me?
c04017 +++$+++ Your desert island top-five.
c04017 +++$+++ Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
c04017 +++$+++ Is there a difference?
c04017 +++$+++ OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
c04017 +++$+++ Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
c04017 +++$+++ What do you mean, four more?
c04017 +++$+++ Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
c04017 +++$+++ Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
c10303 +++$+++ It's just... I leave behind friends, family, a coupla good job offers in Chicago and in three dizzying weeks I've helped acquit a coke dealer, a speed dealer --
c10303 +++$+++ I specialize, Roger...
c10303 +++$+++ -- an angel dust dealer --
c10303 +++$+++ I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
c10303 +++$+++ -- a speed manufacturer --
c10303 +++$+++ So go take your job on Wall Street.
c10303 +++$+++ Hey. You plan to be a criminal defense attorney, know this going in: Everybody's guilty.
c06741 +++$+++ The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
c06741 +++$+++ Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
c06741 +++$+++ He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
c06741 +++$+++ Do you know where I can steal some?
c18877 +++$+++ What's that?
c18877 +++$+++ _Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
c18877 +++$+++ So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
c18877 +++$+++ Ten CC's of this shit and you won't be dreaming about anything.
c18877 +++$+++ How long will the effect last?
c18877 +++$+++ About ten minutes.
c18877 +++$+++ If I give you a bigger dose, it'll give you a heart attack.
c20440 +++$+++ Mom?  You're alive...
c20440 +++$+++ Of course I am.
c20440 +++$+++ I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you...
c26415 +++$+++ Megan?
c26415 +++$+++ Yes. Is this David?
c26415 +++$+++ My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
c26320 +++$+++ You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
c26320 +++$+++ I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
c26320 +++$+++ Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
c26320 +++$+++ If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife . . .?
c20402 +++$+++ My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
c20402 +++$+++ I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
c20402 +++$+++ Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
c20402 +++$+++ Archie.
c20402 +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
c12623 +++$+++ Yes? What is it?
c12623 +++$+++ Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
c12623 +++$+++ Oh God, that stuff stinks.
c12623 +++$+++ Oh yeah, that's good.
c14991 +++$+++ Rough, huh?
c14991 +++$+++ Rough.  We didn't have to do it, John.
c14991 +++$+++ No?
c14991 +++$+++ No. How's Angela? How's she taking it?
c14991 +++$+++ Not so good.
c14991 +++$+++ Worse since she talked to him.
c09948 +++$+++ Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
c09948 +++$+++ I'm sorry for upsetting you, [beat] but I'm not lying to you.
c09948 +++$+++ You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
c09948 +++$+++ [Beat] What?
c09948 +++$+++ William Starks is dead... [Beat] I've been to his grave.
c09948 +++$+++ His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...
c19485 +++$+++ That's it, give it your best shot.
c19485 +++$+++ Would you watch the damn road?
c19485 +++$+++ I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
c19485 +++$+++ I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
c24712 +++$+++ I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape. How did you do that?
c24712 +++$+++ I don't remember in detail, there were so many.
c24712 +++$+++ Did you call someone you knew?
c24712 +++$+++ Let me me help you, then. You picked up the phone and made a call -  'Hello, Adolf? Wilhelm speaking. Listen, old pal, there's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help. He needs a permit to get to Paris.'
c00002 +++$+++ No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
c00002 +++$+++ Cameron.
c00002 +++$+++ Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
c18106 +++$+++ No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
c18106 +++$+++ That's what I came to talk to you about.
c18106 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c18106 +++$+++ Leave it to me.
c08104 +++$+++ Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
c08104 +++$+++ All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
c08104 +++$+++ No, I'm not!
c10430 +++$+++ Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
c10430 +++$+++ And are they going to get it?
c10430 +++$+++ They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
c10430 +++$+++ Maybe what?
c10430 +++$+++ Maybe I can do something right.
c10430 +++$+++ That's what I'm going to try to do.
c23217 +++$+++ Who are they?
c23217 +++$+++ Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
c23217 +++$+++ Does she know about us?
c23217 +++$+++ Jesus, she's my best friend.
c23217 +++$+++ Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
c23217 +++$+++ C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
c09698 +++$+++ You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
c09698 +++$+++ Oh, yes.
c09698 +++$+++ Will I be seeing you again?
c09698 +++$+++ San Francisco's a long way from here.
c09698 +++$+++ I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
c09698 +++$+++ How does Mother know what I like to do?
c09698 +++$+++ I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
c09698 +++$+++ Oh. That. Rome.
c09698 +++$+++ Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
c09698 +++$+++ In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
c09698 +++$+++ Without any clothes on?
c09698 +++$+++ With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
c09698 +++$+++ You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
c09698 +++$+++ I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
c09698 +++$+++ The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
c09698 +++$+++ Yes, but...
c09698 +++$+++ ...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
c09698 +++$+++ Yes.
c09698 +++$+++ ...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
c09698 +++$+++ Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
c09698 +++$+++ Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
c09698 +++$+++ No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
c09698 +++$+++ So you didn't go to school together.
c09698 +++$+++ No.
c09698 +++$+++ And you didn't come up here to see her.
c09698 +++$+++ No.
c09698 +++$+++ You were lying.
c09698 +++$+++ Yes, I was lying.
c09698 +++$+++ Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
c09698 +++$+++ I wrote the letter.
c09698 +++$+++ What did it say?
c09698 +++$+++ It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
c09698 +++$+++ But you tore it up.
c09698 +++$+++ Yes.
c09698 +++$+++ Why?
c09698 +++$+++ Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
c09698 +++$+++ Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
c09698 +++$+++ I told you what happened in Rome!
c09698 +++$+++ I don't give a damn what you believe!
c18776 +++$+++ He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
c18776 +++$+++ I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
c18776 +++$+++ Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
c18776 +++$+++ Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. _ 124.
c00671 +++$+++ Alex?
c00671 +++$+++ Yes?
c00671 +++$+++ Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
c00671 +++$+++ Good.
c16316 +++$+++ And this guy is...
c16316 +++$+++ Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.
c16316 +++$+++ Gustafson's accountant.
c16316 +++$+++ Yah.
c16316 +++$+++ But we still haven't found Gustafson.
c16316 +++$+++ - looking.
c16316 +++$+++ Sorry - didn't copy.
c16316 +++$+++ Still missing. We're looking.
c16316 +++$+++ Yah. Where are ya, Margie?
c21968 +++$+++ --and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
c21968 +++$+++ I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
c21968 +++$+++ It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
c21968 +++$+++ No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
c21968 +++$+++ Oh, is that what caused it?
c21968 +++$+++ You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
c21968 +++$+++ How much money have you got?
c21968 +++$+++ Well, that being the case, I'll take it up with the board of directors. Hey, listen, aviator, here we are!
c26522 +++$+++ I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
c26522 +++$+++ Then why didn't you help him?
c26522 +++$+++ I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
c26522 +++$+++ It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
c26202 +++$+++ What?
c26202 +++$+++ Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
c26202 +++$+++ Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
c20422 +++$+++ Where is my son?
c20422 +++$+++ Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
c20422 +++$+++ Why is he not here?
c20422 +++$+++ He is sick, ma'am.
c20422 +++$+++ Then why are you not with him?
c20422 +++$+++ You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
c20422 +++$+++ He has typhoid fever, ma'am.
c02359 +++$+++ Excellency, may I present my niece.
c02359 +++$+++ Go ahead.
c02359 +++$+++ And Vera niece, too.
c15345 +++$+++ We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
c15345 +++$+++ Isn't he?
c15345 +++$+++ Look, he doesn't have any money... but I'll give you everything I've got.  I have a few hundred dollars.
c10634 +++$+++ That's just how my brain works, I guess.
c10634 +++$+++ Fascinating. Listen, why don't you come out with us after the lecture. There's a place on the Hill I always get Trip to take me.
c10634 +++$+++ Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
c03450 +++$+++ What's that?
c03450 +++$+++ I said -- not exactly -- no.
c03450 +++$+++ Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
c11486 +++$+++ All right -- I'll tell him.  Hey, Baxter -- that was Personnel. Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
c11486 +++$+++ Sheldrake?
c11486 +++$+++ Oh!
c03464 +++$+++ Will you come in, please?
c03464 +++$+++ What?
c03464 +++$+++ I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
c03464 +++$+++ Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
c23353 +++$+++ The Van Garretts died first; a man and his son, survived by a wife and two infants.  And the Widow Windsor was next...
c23353 +++$+++ And now Jonathan Masbath.
c23353 +++$+++ He would not have gone into the Western Woods.  No sane man would.
c18516 +++$+++ Oh, am I glad to see you.
c18516 +++$+++ Say, where's Mother?
c18516 +++$+++ Oh, wait. Wait . . . Wait a minute.
c14439 +++$+++ Oh, maaaaan?!
c14439 +++$+++ What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
c14439 +++$+++ With the F.B.I. there's no such thing as a little help.  They bury you with help.  Explain to me about this virus, no don't tell me about the virus.  Thing is, you saw it, the pictures.
c02380 +++$+++ Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
c02380 +++$+++ Yes?
c02380 +++$+++ Did you see it?
c15152 +++$+++ Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
c15152 +++$+++ I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
c15152 +++$+++ Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
c15152 +++$+++ They're okay.
c15152 +++$+++ You alone, or you got confederates?
c15152 +++$+++ I'm not alone.
c15152 +++$+++ How many you got in there?
c15152 +++$+++ I got Sal.
c15152 +++$+++ Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?
c13689 +++$+++ But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
c13689 +++$+++ Let's look anyway.
c13689 +++$+++ I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.
c11215 +++$+++ Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
c11215 +++$+++ Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
c11215 +++$+++ Yeah, that's pretty much it.
c11215 +++$+++ I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
c11215 +++$+++ What was your name again?
c11215 +++$+++ Michelle.
c11215 +++$+++ Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
c11215 +++$+++ Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
c11215 +++$+++ Yes.  Seriously.
c11215 +++$+++ Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
c11215 +++$+++ Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
c09953 +++$+++ Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
c09953 +++$+++ You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
c09953 +++$+++ It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
c09372 +++$+++ I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
c09372 +++$+++ I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
c09372 +++$+++ Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
c09372 +++$+++ Why not?
c09372 +++$+++ It's a rebound.
c09372 +++$+++ We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
c09372 +++$+++ Six years.
c15580 +++$+++ You knew the deal. No contact.
c15580 +++$+++ Who was that other guy?
c15580 +++$+++ One of many people who would live a word with you.
c15580 +++$+++ Who are they?
c15580 +++$+++ You've heard of the National Security Agency?
c15580 +++$+++ What do they have to do with this?
c15580 +++$+++ That's who they are.
c15580 +++$+++ The NSA?
c15580 +++$+++ Yes.
c15580 +++$+++ You're crazy.
c15580 +++$+++ Okay.
c15580 +++$+++ Wait.
c15580 +++$+++ You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
c15580 +++$+++ I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.
c10291 +++$+++ I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.
c10291 +++$+++ We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
c10291 +++$+++ The con...!  Oh my God.
c10291 +++$+++ Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
c10291 +++$+++ What?
c10291 +++$+++ Ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.
c10668 +++$+++ Shit, James. You shot Dr. Gaskell's dog.
c10668 +++$+++ I had to. Didn't I?
c10668 +++$+++ Couldn't you've just pulled him off me?
c10668 +++$+++ Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.
c00379 +++$+++ Where'd Twombley get shot?
c00379 +++$+++ In the chest.
c00379 +++$+++ No, I mean whereabouts.
c00379 +++$+++ A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
c00379 +++$+++ You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
c00379 +++$+++ The ambulance guys lugged him up.
c00379 +++$+++ You stayed away?
c00379 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00379 +++$+++ Where'd you get the blood?
c00379 +++$+++ What blood?
c00379 +++$+++ On your sleeve.
c00379 +++$+++ Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
c00379 +++$+++ I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
c00379 +++$+++ Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or something. I just heard the gun go off.
c00379 +++$+++ I never seen a man shot before. Not even in the service. Must be something.
c00379 +++$+++ Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
c00379 +++$+++ Sure you did.
c00379 +++$+++ What?
c00379 +++$+++ Saw him do it?
c00379 +++$+++ What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
c00379 +++$+++ Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
c22616 +++$+++ Miles Davis. "All Blues."
c22616 +++$+++ Never heard of him.
c22616 +++$+++ Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
c22616 +++$+++ Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
c03548 +++$+++ It's always so quiet here.
c03548 +++$+++ If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
c03548 +++$+++ No doubt you would, Baron. But do you know, I'm quite indispensable to her. I'm her ballet master and her nurse. I hardly belong to myself anymore. But, there you are, it's Grusinskaya -- you can't help adoring her.
c15259 +++$+++ You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
c15259 +++$+++ Oh, is this your special place?
c15259 +++$+++ No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
c15259 +++$+++ Can we eat there tomorrow?
c15259 +++$+++ It'll be like taking candy from a stranger.
c17441 +++$+++ They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
c17441 +++$+++ It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
c17441 +++$+++ I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
c17441 +++$+++ I could hide you, Tommy.
c17441 +++$+++ I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
c17441 +++$+++ Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
c17441 +++$+++ You know what I been thinkin' about, Ma? About Casy. About what he said, what he done, an' about how he died. An' I remember all of it.
c17441 +++$+++ He was a good man.
c17441 +++$+++ I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
c17441 +++$+++ Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
c17441 +++$+++ They gonna drive me anyways. Soon or later they'll get me, for one thing if not another. Until then...
c17441 +++$+++ You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
c17441 +++$+++ No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
c17441 +++$+++ How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
c17441 +++$+++ Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
c17441 +++$+++ Then what, Tom?
c17441 +++$+++ Then it don't matter. Then I'll be all aroun' in the dark. I'll be ever'where--wherever you look. Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell when they're mad--an' I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry an' they know supper's ready. An' when our people eat the stuff they raise, an' live in the houses they build, why, I'll be there too.
c17441 +++$+++ I don't understan' it, Tom.
c17441 +++$+++ Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by.
c17441 +++$+++ Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
c17441 +++$+++ Good-by, Tommy.
c01219 +++$+++ The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
c01219 +++$+++ Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
c01219 +++$+++ There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
c24769 +++$+++ You deserted me.
c24769 +++$+++ You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
c24769 +++$+++ Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
c27342 +++$+++ Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
c27342 +++$+++ I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
c27342 +++$+++ You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
c27342 +++$+++ But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
c27342 +++$+++ Who says you're the good guys?
c08324 +++$+++ I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
c08324 +++$+++ Could be risky.
c08324 +++$+++ Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
c08324 +++$+++ No, I mean doing it at my house.
c08324 +++$+++ Afraid of getting caught?
c08324 +++$+++ Maybe.
c08324 +++$+++ You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
c08324 +++$+++ Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
c08324 +++$+++ I'm intrigued.
c08324 +++$+++ Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.
c12373 +++$+++ There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
c12373 +++$+++ Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
c12373 +++$+++ He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
c12373 +++$+++ What's he been in?
c12373 +++$+++ Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
c12373 +++$+++ Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
c12373 +++$+++ Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
c12373 +++$+++ Good. We'll sell tickets.
c12373 +++$+++ Tickets to Malkovich?
c12373 +++$+++ Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
c12373 +++$+++ But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
c12373 +++$+++ Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
c12373 +++$+++ You wanted to be partners with me?
c12373 +++$+++ Sure. It'd be fun.
c12373 +++$+++ I'll protect you, Dollface.
c09295 +++$+++ You run the plates?
c09295 +++$+++ Fella's name is Harold Speck, travelin' man out of Roswell.
c09295 +++$+++ Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
c24859 +++$+++ Had a feeling it was you.
c24859 +++$+++ You look alike.
c24859 +++$+++ Perhaps it was the smoke.
c24859 +++$+++ She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
c20428 +++$+++ Nick...
c20428 +++$+++ Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just...
c20428 +++$+++ What the hell are you talking about?
c26528 +++$+++ My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
c26528 +++$+++ The district attorney's office will comply provided -
c26528 +++$+++ No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
c26528 +++$+++ Immunity.
c22087 +++$+++ Yeah... great.
c22087 +++$+++ You know... you could say thank you.
c22087 +++$+++ What are you, communist?  At least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
c10995 +++$+++ 10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
c10995 +++$+++ Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
c10995 +++$+++ Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
c10995 +++$+++ Good!  Moisture content?
c10995 +++$+++ Zero.  Dry as a bone.
c10995 +++$+++ Any microorganisms?
c10995 +++$+++ Not a one.  It's dead.
c10995 +++$+++ Anything else?
c10995 +++$+++ Well, we won't need pressure suits, but breathing masks are called for. Sandy -- can you rig up some kind of portable unit that we can use to follow that transmission to its source?
c25108 +++$+++ What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
c25108 +++$+++ Traveler.
c25108 +++$+++ You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
c25108 +++$+++ I don't think so.
c25108 +++$+++ I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
c00443 +++$+++ Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do this?
c00443 +++$+++ Yes, Mr. President.
c00443 +++$+++ Why?
c00443 +++$+++ Because it is my duty.
c00443 +++$+++ My loyalty was never to my country.
c09789 +++$+++ What does that mean?
c09789 +++$+++ It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
c09789 +++$+++ He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
c12844 +++$+++ Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
c12844 +++$+++ Mom's orders.
c12844 +++$+++ I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
c09396 +++$+++ That was Sue. We got two parties tonight. One's for a modeling agency.
c09396 +++$+++ I don't know...
c09396 +++$+++ Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
c09396 +++$+++ Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
c09396 +++$+++ Listen to you. I got an audition for a pilot at nine and I'm going. You gotta get out with some beautiful babies. You can't sit home thinking about her.
c09396 +++$+++ I don't know...
c09396 +++$+++ I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
c09396 +++$+++ We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
c09396 +++$+++ You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
c09396 +++$+++ What are you talking about? Vegas?
c09396 +++$+++ VEGAS.
c09396 +++$+++ What Vegas?
c09396 +++$+++ We're going to Vegas.
c09396 +++$+++ When?
c09396 +++$+++ Tonight, baby.
c09396 +++$+++ You're crazy.
c09396 +++$+++ I'll pick you up in a half an hour.
c09396 +++$+++ Shut up -- yes you are. Now listen to Tee. We'll stop at a cash machine on the way.
c24625 +++$+++ How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll was going?  To the best of your recollection?
c24625 +++$+++ Seventy-two miles an hour.
c24625 +++$+++ Positive.
c02305 +++$+++ You're what?!
c02305 +++$+++ I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
c02305 +++$+++ Oh God, I'm dead...
c07056 +++$+++ I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
c07056 +++$+++ Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
c07056 +++$+++ No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
c07056 +++$+++ We are covering up!  For some petty, stupid shit.  There are things I can say -- when other people say them, they'd be lies. But when I say them nobody believes me anyway ...
c12548 +++$+++ This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
c12548 +++$+++ I want to see the tapes.
c12548 +++$+++ No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
c05287 +++$+++ You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
c05287 +++$+++ I wouldn't know.
c05287 +++$+++ That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
c05287 +++$+++ How'd you get in here?
c05287 +++$+++ The door was open.
c05287 +++$+++ No it wasn't.
c05287 +++$+++ Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
c05287 +++$+++ You ever do any hunting, Peter?
c20332 +++$+++ Now stand aside worthy adversary.
c20332 +++$+++ 'Tis but a scratch.
c20332 +++$+++ A scratch?  Your arm's off.
c20332 +++$+++ No, it isn't.
c20332 +++$+++ Well, what's that then?
c20332 +++$+++ I've had worse.
c20332 +++$+++ Come on you pansy!
c26142 +++$+++ Uh huh.  Okay.
c26142 +++$+++ It's not okay.  It's extortion.
c26142 +++$+++ What did you tell him?
c26142 +++$+++ Good thinking, honey.
c14943 +++$+++ So what do you think of my father?
c14943 +++$+++ I'll take him over mine.
c14943 +++$+++ What?
c14943 +++$+++ Todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up.  The meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into Harvard. know what I mean?
c21013 +++$+++ Hello.
c21013 +++$+++ May I help you, sir?
c21013 +++$+++ Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
c21013 +++$+++ No, that's right -- I know that.  She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
c15283 +++$+++ Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
c15283 +++$+++ Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
c15283 +++$+++ Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
c25548 +++$+++ Everybody says you were a grand detective.
c25548 +++$+++ They were kidding you.
c25548 +++$+++ Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
c07214 +++$+++ I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
c07214 +++$+++ I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine...  Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea...  I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
c07214 +++$+++ Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
c23982 +++$+++ I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
c23982 +++$+++ Oh, God...
c23982 +++$+++ And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
c23982 +++$+++ I don't drink.
c23982 +++$+++ One moment.
c18346 +++$+++ We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
c18346 +++$+++ And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
c18346 +++$+++ That's besides the point.
c13224 +++$+++ Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
c13224 +++$+++ I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
c13224 +++$+++ I don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  It was out there...
c20830 +++$+++ Pour your own trouble, Will.
c20830 +++$+++ Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
c20830 +++$+++ Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
c04630 +++$+++ Thank you, Bob.
c04630 +++$+++ Who's calling?
c04630 +++$+++ My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
c04630 +++$+++ Did you say Berman?
c04630 +++$+++ No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
c04630 +++$+++ "60 Minutes"?
c04630 +++$+++ Yeah.
c04630 +++$+++ Yes.
c22430 +++$+++ You make the plate?
c22430 +++$+++ What plate?
c22430 +++$+++ The license!  You get it?!
c22430 +++$+++ No.
c22430 +++$+++ What the hell kinda cop are you?!
c22430 +++$+++ Did you make the plate?!
c22430 +++$+++ It was my ass that almost got trashed!
c22430 +++$+++ He was trying to kill me, not you.
c22430 +++$+++ Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
c22430 +++$+++ Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
c23207 +++$+++ ... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
c23207 +++$+++ We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
c23207 +++$+++ Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
c23207 +++$+++ Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
c23207 +++$+++ Why, why do you think that is?
c23207 +++$+++ Well, I don't know.
c26504 +++$+++ The answer is no.
c26504 +++$+++ Mr. Soze will be most -
c26504 +++$+++ A strange threat. I can only assume you're here to kill me anyway. Pity about Mr. Redfoot.
c18644 +++$+++ She still talking to you?
c18644 +++$+++ We're in love.
c18644 +++$+++ Sure.
c18644 +++$+++ No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
c18644 +++$+++ Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
c11410 +++$+++ And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that...
c11410 +++$+++ It's a novel.
c11410 +++$+++ About me!
c11410 +++$+++ Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally.
c11410 +++$+++ What are you saying?
c11410 +++$+++ Hello?  Last birthday was?
c11410 +++$+++ I don't look my age, Joe.
c11410 +++$+++ Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
c11410 +++$+++ It's a shit novel anyway.
c11410 +++$+++ Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress.
c11410 +++$+++ Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
c11410 +++$+++ Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
c11410 +++$+++ Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
c11410 +++$+++ Mac?  Mac says it?  Cal?
c12501 +++$+++ It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
c12501 +++$+++ Dude.
c12501 +++$+++ Huh?
c12501 +++$+++ I don't know, sir.
c12501 +++$+++ Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.
c18850 +++$+++ Dad - - Dad - -
c18850 +++$+++ Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
c18850 +++$+++ That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!
c01010 +++$+++ This must be the last straw.
c01010 +++$+++ Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
c01010 +++$+++ I expect we'll have to gatecrash.
c03455 +++$+++ BENJAMIN?
c03455 +++$+++ Yes.
c03455 +++$+++ I have to go now. I'm sorry.
c23334 +++$+++ And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna take.
c23334 +++$+++ But Vince has contacts all over the place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll be looking for me!
c23334 +++$+++ Everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here but me.  We're trying to get a quick court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. I'll spring you as soon as I can.
c23334 +++$+++ Pray.
c24685 +++$+++ So she's pretty cool, huh?
c24685 +++$+++ Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
c24685 +++$+++ Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
c20879 +++$+++ What?
c20879 +++$+++ Well, do you?
c20879 +++$+++ Nice.
c22047 +++$+++ Um-m, well...
c22047 +++$+++ Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
c22047 +++$+++ She's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all. Oh, I got rid of her, Buddy, I didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. Hell, she was screwin' everybody in Savannah. I caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did I beat the everlastin' piss out of him!
c08216 +++$+++ Man, that one made me puke!
c08216 +++$+++ You forgot something...
c08216 +++$+++ Yes you are.
c23584 +++$+++ Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
c23584 +++$+++ I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
c23584 +++$+++ Why not?
c23584 +++$+++ Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
c23584 +++$+++ Want to switch berths with me?
c23584 +++$+++ Not at all.
c02840 +++$+++ A warming wind.
c02840 +++$+++ This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
c02840 +++$+++ Aye, Captain.
c19018 +++$+++ Hostile?  Me?  Thelma, I'm not hostile.  I am anything but hostile.  But if you want to know what I am.  I'll tell you what I am. What I am is, I am hurt.  I am very hurt.  And I just want to know one thing, okay?  Just one thing ...Why?  That's all I want to know...Why?
c19018 +++$+++ Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
c19018 +++$+++ Things? What kind of things?
c19018 +++$+++ I mean...things.  Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
c19018 +++$+++ Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
c19018 +++$+++ Did it ever occur to you guys that Joanna Kramer's not the easiest person in the world to live with?!  Did it?!  For one thing she's always thirty minutes late.  You can set your watch by it--
c26612 +++$+++ Hello.
c26612 +++$+++ Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
c26612 +++$+++ No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
c26612 +++$+++ She... went into the Bay.
c22836 +++$+++ Who?
c22836 +++$+++ I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
c22836 +++$+++ But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
c22836 +++$+++ In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
c22836 +++$+++ Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
c13969 +++$+++ Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
c13969 +++$+++ That's right, Modern Times.
c13969 +++$+++ I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going?
c13969 +++$+++ Yes.
c13969 +++$+++ It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.
c00176 +++$+++ Any ideas about the colour?
c00176 +++$+++ Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
c00176 +++$+++ I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
c14151 +++$+++ Man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
c14151 +++$+++ I'm glad you find humor in this.  Do you know what people would do for that?
c14151 +++$+++ I can't believe you just said that.
c14151 +++$+++ Making things real rough for Hal.
c14403 +++$+++ Kill me, Peter, do it, now.
c14403 +++$+++ No.  Not yet.
c14403 +++$+++ Don't talk to me about courage.  I know death, what it's like to kill. You're not a killer -- you watched Daryll Lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear.  You chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about you.
c26576 +++$+++ Dr. Gruber.
c26576 +++$+++ Dr. Gruber's not in.
c26576 +++$+++ I had an appointment at his office, I think I must have got it wrong. We had a meeting...
c26576 +++$+++ Where is he?
c21403 +++$+++ The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four--eyed worm.
c21403 +++$+++ Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
c21403 +++$+++ You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
c21403 +++$+++ What was?
c21403 +++$+++ Dancing with you.
c21403 +++$+++ You're a sweet man, Richard.
c21403 +++$+++ You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
c05603 +++$+++ Are you sure you're totally into guys?
c05603 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c05603 +++$+++ I'm not gay.
c13397 +++$+++ Okay. Just take it easy.
c13397 +++$+++ Right away. Okay?
c13397 +++$+++ Okay.
c22533 +++$+++ I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
c22533 +++$+++ What?
c22533 +++$+++ I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
c22533 +++$+++ I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
c22533 +++$+++ But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
c22533 +++$+++ Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
c22533 +++$+++ I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
c22533 +++$+++ It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
c22533 +++$+++ I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
c22533 +++$+++ Yes, I did.
c22533 +++$+++ Any time.
c03152 +++$+++ Dodge.  Dodge.
c03152 +++$+++ What?
c03152 +++$+++ Yeah, yeah.
c21512 +++$+++ An' this?
c21512 +++$+++ Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
c21512 +++$+++ Well, what's the need, anyway? If he's gone, he's gone. Why should he bother us?
c13662 +++$+++ Eat something, would you?
c13662 +++$+++ Can't.
c13662 +++$+++ Can't eat through a canvas bag.
c16363 +++$+++ Could be worse.  A woman could cut off your penis while you're asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
c16363 +++$+++ There's always that.
c16363 +++$+++ I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
c16363 +++$+++ I mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  The trendy paper lamps, the Euro-trash shelving unit, am I right?
c21011 +++$+++ Any more announcements?
c21011 +++$+++ Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
c21011 +++$+++ But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
c11176 +++$+++ You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
c11176 +++$+++ I think so.
c11176 +++$+++ Are you sure?
c11176 +++$+++ No.
c11176 +++$+++ When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
c11176 +++$+++ It may never come out.
c11176 +++$+++ Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
c11176 +++$+++ Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
c11176 +++$+++ And the underground garage one.  Would I know him?
c11176 +++$+++ I couldn't say.
c11176 +++$+++ But it's possible.
c11176 +++$+++ It is.
c11176 +++$+++ You've never told anyone who he is?  But you'd have to tell me if I asked you.  Tell me.
c11176 +++$+++ I really want to know.
c21139 +++$+++ Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
c21139 +++$+++ No one's perfect, Kate.
c21139 +++$+++ No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
c02521 +++$+++ Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
c02521 +++$+++ That's a good one.
c02521 +++$+++ It's a good one all right.
c07584 +++$+++ I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
c07584 +++$+++ No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
c07584 +++$+++ Why not?
c07584 +++$+++ Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
c07584 +++$+++ What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
c07584 +++$+++ Well, it's your business to get news! And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me. If it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back. That's all.
c25907 +++$+++ When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
c25907 +++$+++ You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
c25907 +++$+++ You always got something to say.
c03758 +++$+++ You're in one hell of a jam.  You realize that?
c03758 +++$+++ I'm high as a kite.
c03758 +++$+++ Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
c03758 +++$+++ You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
c03758 +++$+++ I love you!  Have a cigar!
c03758 +++$+++ Evolution has made you a clown-- with a cigar.  Simple butchers like you are obsolete!
c03758 +++$+++ I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
c03758 +++$+++ If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
c03758 +++$+++ This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
c03758 +++$+++ You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
c03758 +++$+++ I'm an honorable clown?
c03758 +++$+++ King Arthur.
c03758 +++$+++ You hope.
c03758 +++$+++ In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
c03758 +++$+++ No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
c03758 +++$+++ Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
c03758 +++$+++ Cut me open.  Find out.
c03758 +++$+++ I've struck my blow.
c03758 +++$+++ With spittle?
c03758 +++$+++ I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
c03758 +++$+++ I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
c03758 +++$+++ Poison.
c03758 +++$+++ You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
c03758 +++$+++ I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
c03758 +++$+++ You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
c03758 +++$+++ No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
c03758 +++$+++ I see.
c03758 +++$+++ You aren't going to hurt me.  You aren't going to hurt anybody any more.  Any violent gesture will seem ridiculous--to yourself!
c03758 +++$+++ Don Quixote.
c03758 +++$+++ My violin is avenged!
c03758 +++$+++ Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
c03758 +++$+++ And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
c03758 +++$+++ The new hero is you.
c03758 +++$+++ I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
c03758 +++$+++ You're too modest.
c03758 +++$+++ But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
c03758 +++$+++ Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
c13414 +++$+++ So, what'd ya do with it?
c13414 +++$+++ With what?
c13414 +++$+++ With the money.
c13414 +++$+++ He needed some clothes.
c13414 +++$+++ Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
c13414 +++$+++ He wanted a watch, too.
c13414 +++$+++ Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
c13414 +++$+++ Mm-hm.
c22683 +++$+++ Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
c22683 +++$+++ Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
c22683 +++$+++ Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
c22683 +++$+++ No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
c22683 +++$+++ But, sir...
c10169 +++$+++ You ever try solitary confinement?
c10169 +++$+++ No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
c10169 +++$+++ Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
c07534 +++$+++ Susie!  You gotta help me!
c07534 +++$+++ Daniel, what are you doing here?
c07534 +++$+++ Please, Susan!  I need help! Something is wrong with me!
c07534 +++$+++ No, something is really wrong... look!
c14599 +++$+++ I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
c14599 +++$+++ But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
c14599 +++$+++ True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
c14599 +++$+++ My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
c14599 +++$+++ You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
c14599 +++$+++ I knew she would intrigue you.
c14599 +++$+++ She needs direction... and training.
c14599 +++$+++ She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us.  In any case, it will all be over soon.  You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
c14599 +++$+++ That's not for her.  She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
c14599 +++$+++ But Wudan does not accept women.
c14599 +++$+++ For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
c14599 +++$+++ It's not our affair.  Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
c14599 +++$+++ I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world. But the cycle of bloodshed continues.
c14599 +++$+++ Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.
c19081 +++$+++ Oh my God.
c19081 +++$+++ What?
c19081 +++$+++ If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
c19081 +++$+++ Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
c13062 +++$+++ Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.
c13062 +++$+++ Where are you going?
c13062 +++$+++ I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
c13062 +++$+++ Don't do anything silly.
c13062 +++$+++ Take care.
c26675 +++$+++ The floor was wet. She slipped!
c26675 +++$+++ Why was the floor wet?
c26675 +++$+++ Why?!
c10559 +++$+++ How 'bout a beer?
c10559 +++$+++ That'd be fine, Bobby.
c10559 +++$+++ Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
c10559 +++$+++ Thought maybe Sparky and Buddy'd taken ya. Come on, I'll drive.
c22973 +++$+++ 'I, Ethan Edwards, being of sound mind and without any blood kin, do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to Martin Pauley...'  I don't want your property.... 'Sides, what do you mean no 'blood kin?' Debbie's your blood kin...
c22973 +++$+++ Not no more.
c22973 +++$+++ She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
c26029 +++$+++ I don't see why not.
c26029 +++$+++ Because it's illegal.
c26029 +++$+++ Holding hands?
c26029 +++$+++ No, not holding hands.
c26029 +++$+++ And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
c12706 +++$+++ I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
c12706 +++$+++ You're a lucky man, Diego.
c12706 +++$+++ I love you too, man.
c18974 +++$+++ When is mommy coming back?
c18974 +++$+++ Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
c18974 +++$+++ Will she pick me up after school?
c18974 +++$+++ No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
c18974 +++$+++ I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
c20450 +++$+++ Yes...what is it?
c20450 +++$+++ I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
c20450 +++$+++ ... What??
c20450 +++$+++ The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
c20450 +++$+++ How...  how'd they know I was here?
c20450 +++$+++ I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
c20450 +++$+++ So, what did they say?
c20450 +++$+++ Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
c20450 +++$+++ Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
c20450 +++$+++ That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
c20450 +++$+++ Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
c22008 +++$+++ What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking?
c22008 +++$+++ Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news.
c22008 +++$+++ What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
c22008 +++$+++ Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
c22008 +++$+++ No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
c03451 +++$+++ You're not one of those agitators?
c03451 +++$+++ What?
c03451 +++$+++ One of those outside agitators.
c03451 +++$+++ I hate that. I won't stand for it.
c26717 +++$+++ He just doesn't talk a lot.
c26717 +++$+++ Why? What's his problem?
c26717 +++$+++ He's a great chef.
c26717 +++$+++ He's weird. And I expect more from you.
c26717 +++$+++ You expect more what?
c26717 +++$+++ You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on "Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
c26717 +++$+++ It's vile!
c25903 +++$+++ Oh, no.
c25903 +++$+++ Who is it?
c25903 +++$+++ Meaning there may be nuclear material down there?
c24392 +++$+++ That's a lie!  They still want me!
c24392 +++$+++ No, they don't.
c24392 +++$+++ What about the studio? What about De Mille?
c24392 +++$+++ He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
c24392 +++$+++ Wanted what?
c24392 +++$+++ De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
c24392 +++$+++ That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
c24392 +++$+++ That isn't true! Max?
c25345 +++$+++ I am ready now...
c25345 +++$+++ Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
c25345 +++$+++ Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
c14128 +++$+++ I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
c14128 +++$+++ No, I wasn't.
c14128 +++$+++ I don't think your manager would appreciate...
c14128 +++$+++ I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
c14128 +++$+++ I beg your pardon!
c14128 +++$+++ Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
c14128 +++$+++ I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
c14128 +++$+++ I hope it feels good.
c14128 +++$+++ I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
c04062 +++$+++ Books, records, films -- these things matter.  Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
c04062 +++$+++ Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
c04062 +++$+++ The Conformist.
c04062 +++$+++ Exactly!  Fucking ex-actly!
c04062 +++$+++ Nor have you!
c23260 +++$+++ Well I... I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
c23260 +++$+++ You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
c23260 +++$+++ When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
c19964 +++$+++ ...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from.  And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
c19964 +++$+++ Thank you, Quince.
c19964 +++$+++ But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed.  I want to talk to you about them next week.
c19964 +++$+++ Yeah.  Or the week after.
c25716 +++$+++ Crimson!
c25716 +++$+++ Correct!  Good night.
c25716 +++$+++ Good night.
c25716 +++$+++ Goodbye.
c07266 +++$+++ It's not here. Let's go.
c07266 +++$+++ You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
c07266 +++$+++ Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
c07266 +++$+++ I wanted to make a statement.
c07266 +++$+++ Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
c07266 +++$+++ Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
c13582 +++$+++ We're waiting on you.
c13582 +++$+++ Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
c13582 +++$+++ It's in the process.
c13582 +++$+++ I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
c13582 +++$+++ You should've done all this before.
c13582 +++$+++ I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
c13582 +++$+++ Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
c13582 +++$+++ My pleasure --
c13582 +++$+++ Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
c13582 +++$+++ Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
c13582 +++$+++ Negative.
c13582 +++$+++ You'll still have the girl and the husband.
c13582 +++$+++ And not a nickel.
c13582 +++$+++ Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
c13582 +++$+++ And then?
c13582 +++$+++ You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
c13582 +++$+++ I won't let 'em.
c09549 +++$+++ Thank you.
c09549 +++$+++ May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancee?
c09549 +++$+++ I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me. Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when.
c09549 +++$+++ Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
c09549 +++$+++ I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
c09549 +++$+++ Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
c09549 +++$+++ It is a little coarse, yes.
c09549 +++$+++ Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
c09549 +++$+++ I have!
c09549 +++$+++ You have, yes.
c09549 +++$+++ No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
c09549 +++$+++ Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
c09549 +++$+++ Absolutely.
c09549 +++$+++ Tomorrow.
c15986 +++$+++ Are you comfortable Regan?
c15986 +++$+++ Yes.
c15986 +++$+++ How old are you?
c15986 +++$+++ Twelve.
c15986 +++$+++ Is there someone inside you?
c15986 +++$+++ Sometimes.
c15986 +++$+++ Who is it?
c15986 +++$+++ I don't know.
c15986 +++$+++ Is it Captain Howdy?
c15986 +++$+++ If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
c09227 +++$+++ They are beautiful.
c09227 +++$+++ Yes, they are.
c09227 +++$+++ You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn.  You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
c09227 +++$+++ But...
c09227 +++$+++ It will be human and it will look like this.  But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
c09227 +++$+++ You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
c13631 +++$+++ What you doing, Jimmy?
c13631 +++$+++ I'm not sure.
c13631 +++$+++ More than that.
c19233 +++$+++ What have you come as?
c19233 +++$+++ Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
c19233 +++$+++ Get your fingers out of my soup!
c19353 +++$+++ Bad show last night?
c19353 +++$+++ The usual.  Full house. Standing ovation.  I tell them it's magic...
c19353 +++$+++ ... they believe you.
c19353 +++$+++ Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
c19353 +++$+++ Sure.
c19353 +++$+++ Somebody killed him.
c19353 +++$+++ I just saw him.
c19109 +++$+++ <u>You</u>?
c19109 +++$+++ It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
c19109 +++$+++ <u>You</u>?
c19109 +++$+++ It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
c19109 +++$+++ It wasn't suppose to happen, I don't know what to say...
c19904 +++$+++ This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
c19904 +++$+++ He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
c19904 +++$+++ He said that?
c19904 +++$+++ Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
c27284 +++$+++ I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
c27284 +++$+++ Who did you get it from?
c27284 +++$+++ I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
c27284 +++$+++ And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss.
c27284 +++$+++ Your last chance. Take the money.
c27284 +++$+++ Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
c22782 +++$+++ Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?
c22782 +++$+++ I live here.
c22782 +++$+++ I thought you were going to the mixer?
c22782 +++$+++ Just some asshole trying to scare me.
c15465 +++$+++ Ohhh...
c15465 +++$+++ Ed?
c15465 +++$+++ Yeah. Why?
c12842 +++$+++ Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
c12842 +++$+++ We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
c12842 +++$+++ Doesn't matter. Move on.
c02816 +++$+++ Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
c02816 +++$+++ Please sit down...
c02816 +++$+++ You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
c02816 +++$+++ I see.
c02816 +++$+++ Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
c02816 +++$+++ And what's that?
c02816 +++$+++ Normal. Average.
c02816 +++$+++ All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
c02816 +++$+++ ...Did you really say that?
c02816 +++$+++ Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
c02816 +++$+++ This whole thing is a joke!
c02816 +++$+++ Stay calm, please.
c02816 +++$+++ No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
c02816 +++$+++ Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
c11610 +++$+++ Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
c11610 +++$+++ Boss left.
c11610 +++$+++ It's really long left slide, breaks on the short side of the point -- catches a south swell.
c08799 +++$+++ Are you in charge here?
c08799 +++$+++ No, sir...
c08799 +++$+++ I asked for the man in charge...
c08799 +++$+++ That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
c08799 +++$+++ Is she injured?
c09649 +++$+++ What happened?
c09649 +++$+++ What exactly did you hear?
c09649 +++$+++ That you got let go.
c09649 +++$+++ I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
c09649 +++$+++ He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
c09649 +++$+++ Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
c09649 +++$+++ They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
c16163 +++$+++ Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
c16163 +++$+++ You still think this is about me, don't you?
c16163 +++$+++ Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this.  You brought this on yourself...
c18204 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c18204 +++$+++ She has a...friend.  Colleen.
c18204 +++$+++ You, an imaginary friend.  That's what she calls her.
c02794 +++$+++ I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
c02794 +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
c02794 +++$+++ Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
c02794 +++$+++ I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner.  ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
c08894 +++$+++ It took a long time, but eventually I learned to live with it. And I began to realize that my experience in the Nexus had changed me.  I knew things about people, about events, about time.
c08894 +++$+++ Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
c08894 +++$+++ But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
c26296 +++$+++ All right, Grace.  No more games.
c26296 +++$+++ Games?
c26296 +++$+++ Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
c26013 +++$+++ The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
c26013 +++$+++ Any idea how much?
c26013 +++$+++ I've read official estimates but I wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've heard the entire cocaine supply for the United States can fit into four tractor-trailers.  At least a half-dozen of those cars right out there are carrying a load of dope, with drivers employed by people who don't give a damn if they're caught or not.
c26013 +++$+++ What do you look for?
c26013 +++$+++ We ask questions and measure the answers.  When something doesn't ring true, a fact that doesn't make sense, a slight hesitation, then it's off to secondary for a closer look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year.  Now it's almost double.  Pretty soon there'll be Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the border as American truck companies.
c26013 +++$+++ Any way we can do it better?
c26013 +++$+++ Sure.  More money in intelligence on their side of the border.  So we have a better idea who we're looking for.  More dogs.  More people. Supposed to be getting some giant x- ray machines to run the trucks through.  Outside of martial law that's about the best you're gonna do.  But, I should tell you, there are two things that really have us on edge right now.  In the last six months seizures have tripled, even though we're pulling over the same number of cars.  What does that tell you?
c26013 +++$+++ Right.  But, that's not the biggest problem.  One of our Intel officers picked up information from DEA that traffickers have come up with a process, a chemical process, to turn coke into something else.  It doesn't smell like coke.  It doesn't look like coke.  And what's worse, it doesn't react to field test.  It could be anything.  Maybe it's already happening.  I mean, how would we know?
c23068 +++$+++ Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
c23068 +++$+++ I don't know anything about it.
c23068 +++$+++ Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
c23068 +++$+++ Cover it?
c23068 +++$+++ Well?
c23068 +++$+++ But there's no --
c23068 +++$+++ Animals involved? I know, but you need a change. And besides, we're short.
c23068 +++$+++ I don't know.
c23068 +++$+++ Well, I've got this story, it's really good, I'm working on, that is good, I feel it could be big, it this, eh, and it's, you know, it's incredible. Am I right, did you say beyond recognition'?
c27208 +++$+++ Where are you taking us?
c27208 +++$+++ We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
c27208 +++$+++ You have no right to keep us here.
c27208 +++$+++ Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
c27208 +++$+++ You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
c27208 +++$+++ It's not a joke.
c25938 +++$+++ Can we leave this up 'til we move?
c25938 +++$+++ Well, sure, we can leave it up.
c25938 +++$+++ Yeah!
c25938 +++$+++ Okay.
c21688 +++$+++ I can't do this.
c21688 +++$+++ Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
c21688 +++$+++ Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
c13121 +++$+++ He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
c13121 +++$+++ How can that be? He was getting better.
c13121 +++$+++ He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
c13121 +++$+++ He was tough. You did all you could.
c13121 +++$+++ You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
c07051 +++$+++ It's a code or something.
c07051 +++$+++ I figured that out.
c07051 +++$+++ I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
c07051 +++$+++ Yeah?
c07051 +++$+++ Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
c06175 +++$+++ Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
c06175 +++$+++ You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
c06175 +++$+++ Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
c06175 +++$+++ You do your best. They won't be paying you enough to perform miracles.
c18929 +++$+++ Who?
c18929 +++$+++ Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
c18929 +++$+++ Gee.
c18929 +++$+++ He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
c18929 +++$+++ Why?
c18929 +++$+++ You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
c18929 +++$+++ Honest?
c18929 +++$+++ Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
c16366 +++$+++ They're called "cigarette burns."
c16366 +++$+++ It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
c16366 +++$+++ Why would anyone want this shitty job?
c16366 +++$+++ It affords him other interesting opportunities.
c16366 +++$+++ In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
c10348 +++$+++ Where is the ring?
c10348 +++$+++ Someone else has it now.
c10348 +++$+++ That would indicate that it's the future.
c10348 +++$+++ The later events have never been kept a secret.
c10348 +++$+++ You are here and there is no place to go...
c01196 +++$+++ Where are you from?
c01196 +++$+++ Helsinki, which is the capital of Finland.
c01196 +++$+++ Finland.
c01196 +++$+++ You know, Finlandia vodka?  Yes?
c01196 +++$+++ What's a Negro.
c00033 +++$+++ So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
c00033 +++$+++ William would never have gone to a state school.
c00033 +++$+++ William didn't even go to high school
c00033 +++$+++ Neither has his heterosexuality.
c11148 +++$+++ I'll never get out of here in time.
c11148 +++$+++ The telephone calls... we know about that.
c11148 +++$+++ --yeah, that was in The Times this morning.
c18437 +++$+++ You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
c18437 +++$+++ We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
c18437 +++$+++ We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
c16491 +++$+++ I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
c16491 +++$+++ Parry, you don't have to <u>earn</u> a woman. It's the twentieth century.
c16491 +++$+++ Maybe, when we get the Grail...
c16491 +++$+++ Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
c16491 +++$+++ Happily married, probably.
c16491 +++$+++ Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
c16491 +++$+++ Sure...
c25617 +++$+++ Woods.
c25617 +++$+++ Hey, Jaeger.  What's up.
c25617 +++$+++ A map?  All I got is maps.  I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here.  What kind of map you need?  Topographical, geographical, thermal?
c02244 +++$+++ Wait! I know how we can get in!
c02244 +++$+++ Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
c02244 +++$+++ See you at 8:30, Jam. Later.  Dudes? Later.
c21828 +++$+++ Who are you?!
c21828 +++$+++ No one of consequence.
c21828 +++$+++ I must know.
c21828 +++$+++ Okay.
c26404 +++$+++ My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
c26404 +++$+++ What was that all about?
c26404 +++$+++ More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
c14316 +++$+++ ... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
c14316 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c14316 +++$+++ He died...  ... in 1972.
c14316 +++$+++ Dr. Arroway, do you think it's possible you had some kind of... delusional episode.
c01724 +++$+++ You gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! What the fuck is your problem?
c01724 +++$+++ She needed it.
c01724 +++$+++ A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
c01724 +++$+++ Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
c01724 +++$+++ That's what she is!
c01724 +++$+++ I know that. But --
c01724 +++$+++ You're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
c01724 +++$+++ What are you going to do, get married? Have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! And go around scrubbing the --
c01696 +++$+++ The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
c01696 +++$+++ Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
c01696 +++$+++ Thank you, Father, thank you.  Whatever. Goodbye, amen.
c02237 +++$+++ Now listen up. Here's the game plan.
c02237 +++$+++ ...I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that...
c02237 +++$+++ Cool, bro, now listen up...
c02237 +++$+++ Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got...  twenty-five.
c04323 +++$+++ It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
c04323 +++$+++ I like you, too, Nathan.
c04323 +++$+++ You do?
c04323 +++$+++ I don't care. I don't care!  Like what, for example?
c19888 +++$+++ Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?
c19888 +++$+++ Why yes, thank you.
c19888 +++$+++ Hot or cold.
c19888 +++$+++ And a glass.
c16555 +++$+++ What are you going that way for?
c16555 +++$+++ I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
c16555 +++$+++ Where you goin'?
c16555 +++$+++ Pitt.
c16555 +++$+++ Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
c16555 +++$+++ Man, if I go down you're goin' down with me.
c10866 +++$+++ What did you do?
c10866 +++$+++ I'm always bad.
c10866 +++$+++ I breathed!
c12417 +++$+++ I want to work, Miss Lady.
c12417 +++$+++ Work? Start learnin your letters again?
c12417 +++$+++ No. I mean work work.
c12417 +++$+++ Well, what can you do?
c12417 +++$+++ I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
c12417 +++$+++ Extra?
c12417 +++$+++ Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
c12417 +++$+++ No..No that won't do...
c07381 +++$+++ YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
c07381 +++$+++ I am.  I'm here.
c07381 +++$+++ I'm here.  I'm here.
c19386 +++$+++ Hello?
c19386 +++$+++ Bob, it's me.
c19386 +++$+++ Oh, hi, Elaine.
c19386 +++$+++ So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
c19386 +++$+++ Ok.
c19386 +++$+++ Yeah, I'll stay.
c13877 +++$+++ I've got the photographs in my office. If they'll help you remember. What was the argument about?
c13877 +++$+++ My daughter.
c13877 +++$+++ What about her?
c13877 +++$+++ I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.
c24485 +++$+++ Anybody been hurt?
c24485 +++$+++ So far the hostages are unharmed.
c24485 +++$+++ Tourists, about twenty of 'em.
c12457 +++$+++ Hello, gentlemen.  You are the bereaved?
c12457 +++$+++ Yeah man.
c12457 +++$+++ Jeffrey Lebowski.
c25171 +++$+++ In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin?
c25171 +++$+++ Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things?
c25171 +++$+++ The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
c25171 +++$+++ And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
c14825 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c14825 +++$+++ I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
c14825 +++$+++ Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
c23009 +++$+++ We are lost.
c23009 +++$+++ No, it will turn out well.
c23009 +++$+++ I don't know, it's a mystery.
c20014 +++$+++ Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
c20014 +++$+++ Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
c20014 +++$+++ I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.
c20014 +++$+++ We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
c20014 +++$+++ Then why are you here?
c13385 +++$+++ Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?
c13385 +++$+++ No, I'm not okay.
c13385 +++$+++ Well...
c01750 +++$+++ Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper Trust robbery?
c01750 +++$+++ Uh-uh.
c01750 +++$+++ Uh-uh.
c14037 +++$+++ Are you sure?
c14037 +++$+++ Am I sure?
c14037 +++$+++ Are you sure?
c14037 +++$+++ Am I sure about what?
c14037 +++$+++ Do you really want to buy those cigarettes?
c14037 +++$+++ Are you serious?
c14037 +++$+++ What is this, a poll?
c10344 +++$+++ What are you doing here in the trailer court, Deputy?
c10344 +++$+++ Maybe I just live here, what do you think about that?
c10344 +++$+++ You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
c02628 +++$+++ What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
c02628 +++$+++ Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
c02628 +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it here, Brad.
c02383 +++$+++ What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!
c02383 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c02383 +++$+++ I intend to.
c17371 +++$+++ So what's with this place? You have a swan fetish? Is this something you'd like to talk about?
c17371 +++$+++ I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
c17371 +++$+++ No.
c17371 +++$+++ You're just a boy. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
c17371 +++$+++ Why thank you.
c17371 +++$+++ You've never been out of Boston.
c17371 +++$+++ So if I asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...Michelangelo? You know a lot about him I bet. Life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. But you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. And if I asked you about women I'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. But you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. If I asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. And if I asked you about love I'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. Known that someone could kill you with a look. That someone could rescue you from grief. That God had put an angel on Earth just for you. And you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. To have the love be there for her forever. Through anything, through cancer. You wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. And you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. I look at you and I don't see an intelligent confident man, I don't see a peer, and I don't see my equal. I see a boy. Nobody could possibly understand you, right Will? Yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. You must know everything about me. You're an orphan, right?
c09219 +++$+++ The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
c09219 +++$+++ No. Get in.
c09219 +++$+++ I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
c23545 +++$+++ What are you doing?
c23545 +++$+++ I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
c23545 +++$+++ But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
c23545 +++$+++ Fight it.
c23545 +++$+++ Then pull the emergency brake!
c04266 +++$+++ Officers, officers what can I do for you today? I ain't fried up the birds yet... if that's what you're ring a ding dinging about.
c04266 +++$+++ What I need are some answers.
c04266 +++$+++ You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
c24141 +++$+++ You're not.
c24141 +++$+++ Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
c24141 +++$+++ And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
c17475 +++$+++ What do you want?
c17475 +++$+++ I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
c17475 +++$+++ Like a union?
c17475 +++$+++ Like a club. Work less, make more.
c17475 +++$+++ Thank you, no.
c17475 +++$+++ And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
c17985 +++$+++ Did you hear that?
c17985 +++$+++ What?
c17985 +++$+++ Did you hear what he said?
c17985 +++$+++ What?
c17985 +++$+++ He made, you know, a remark.
c17985 +++$+++ Honey, are you okay?
c17985 +++$+++ -- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
c17985 +++$+++ Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
c17985 +++$+++ It's just a dumb game they play. You want to be at a bigger firm, get used to the politics.
c20875 +++$+++ Shit...
c20875 +++$+++ What is it?
c20875 +++$+++ You're out of time, man.
c13859 +++$+++ Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
c13859 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c13859 +++$+++ I will tell you what I...
c24932 +++$+++ OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
c24932 +++$+++ We're just closing, friend.
c24932 +++$+++ Hey, what's your problem, friend? This is a business establishment with posted hours--
c01732 +++$+++ Who tripped the alarm?
c01732 +++$+++ It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
c01732 +++$+++ Where's Kumar?
c01732 +++$+++ Jesus Christ, Anthony. Did you lose him?
c12776 +++$+++ Doctor Trammel, when did you first diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?
c12776 +++$+++ About a year and half ago.
c12776 +++$+++ Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after that?
c12776 +++$+++ Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
c12776 +++$+++ Yes.
c25128 +++$+++ I want to learn to read it.
c25128 +++$+++ Why?
c25128 +++$+++ Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
c25128 +++$+++ I'm good at languages.
c04099 +++$+++ Be quiet.
c04099 +++$+++ -Auditorium nostrum-
c04099 +++$+++ Stop.
c04099 +++$+++ Stop!
c04666 +++$+++ Hello.
c04666 +++$+++ Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
c04666 +++$+++ When should we do this?
c24693 +++$+++ Where do you stand on all this?
c24693 +++$+++ On all what?
c24693 +++$+++ I don't know.
c02241 +++$+++ Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
c02241 +++$+++ Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
c02241 +++$+++ Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
c08646 +++$+++ Yeahhhh. I'm sorry. I just got so excited about... your present.
c08646 +++$+++ My present?
c08646 +++$+++ You're my princess, aren't you?
c08646 +++$+++ I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
c03256 +++$+++ Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
c03256 +++$+++ Jesus!
c03256 +++$+++ C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
c03256 +++$+++ I'm just not one of those guys who has a "type"...
c03256 +++$+++ I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
c16948 +++$+++ Which way?
c16948 +++$+++ Juarez - Chihuahua City road.
c16948 +++$+++ Not now.
c10632 +++$+++ Oh... Look at this... What do you want, snakeskin?
c10632 +++$+++ Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
c10632 +++$+++ Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
c10632 +++$+++ Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
c10632 +++$+++ By who?
c10632 +++$+++ I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
c10632 +++$+++ Heard you was goin' out with that bitch's daughter.
c10632 +++$+++ You heard right.
c10632 +++$+++ You really are one dumb asshole.
c10632 +++$+++ Life is unpredictable.
c10632 +++$+++ Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
c10632 +++$+++ I didn't see nothin'...
c10632 +++$+++ Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
c10632 +++$+++ Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
c10632 +++$+++ I know... I remember.
c10632 +++$+++ Well?...
c10632 +++$+++ Thanks...
c13041 +++$+++ {winking at Sam) She doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.
c13041 +++$+++ Er, I knew you looked different.
c13041 +++$+++ What? - Oh, yes - vividly. I used to wonder if they were real.
c05839 +++$+++ What else about that night?... Did anything happen?
c05839 +++$+++ You really don't remember?
c05839 +++$+++ No... I told you.
c05839 +++$+++ It was weird...
c05839 +++$+++ Whatiya mean, Sheila?
c05839 +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it...
c05839 +++$+++ No... I really don't want to talk about it.
c15440 +++$+++ I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
c15440 +++$+++ I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
c15440 +++$+++ So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
c15440 +++$+++ I know, I ...
c15440 +++$+++ Shari, I really like you...
c15440 +++$+++ I really like you too...
c15440 +++$+++ ...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
c15440 +++$+++ ... yeah, then, but...
c15440 +++$+++ Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
c24520 +++$+++ I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll like me.
c24520 +++$+++ Who?
c24520 +++$+++ Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
c24520 +++$+++ Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come from two different worlds.
c20281 +++$+++ Hi.
c20281 +++$+++ Hi.
c20281 +++$+++ You look beautiful. Your hair...
c20281 +++$+++ Thank you.
c16605 +++$+++ Damn, I thought I had that one.
c16605 +++$+++ You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
c16605 +++$+++ What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
c16605 +++$+++ Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
c11084 +++$+++ Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
c11084 +++$+++ I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
c11084 +++$+++ I'd like that.
c10080 +++$+++ Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
c10080 +++$+++ Do what?
c10080 +++$+++ Turn her over to a stalker.
c10080 +++$+++ That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!
c19600 +++$+++ You look great.
c19600 +++$+++ What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
c19600 +++$+++ ...you know...
c19600 +++$+++ Did your wife find out?
c19600 +++$+++ No.
c19600 +++$+++ Then what?
c19600 +++$+++ It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
c19600 +++$+++ I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.
c03782 +++$+++ Possibly.
c03782 +++$+++ How long has this been going on?
c03782 +++$+++ A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
c03782 +++$+++ I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
c03782 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c03782 +++$+++ Marry me instead.
c03782 +++$+++ Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
c03782 +++$+++ You're saying no.
c03782 +++$+++ I'm saying no--and thank you.
c03782 +++$+++ I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
c03782 +++$+++ What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
c05697 +++$+++ Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
c05697 +++$+++ What am I gonna eat?
c05697 +++$+++ You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
c05697 +++$+++ Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
c14235 +++$+++ First time in New York?
c14235 +++$+++ Third, but I still can't tell uptown from downtown.  Tell the truth, whenever I'm here, I can't wait to leave.  Place gets to me.  Too loud, too fast...too much.  You like it here?
c14235 +++$+++ It's home.
c14235 +++$+++ I see your point.
c17550 +++$+++ Would you let me ride your horse?
c17550 +++$+++ Have you talked to Tom about it?
c17550 +++$+++ I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
c23433 +++$+++ Let's just go, Marsha.
c23433 +++$+++ No, we have to get this story.
c23433 +++$+++ Why won't he talk to women?
c24578 +++$+++ Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
c24578 +++$+++ Billy, that's too early.
c24578 +++$+++ Can't you make it later?
c18050 +++$+++ Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
c18050 +++$+++ Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
c18050 +++$+++ Would you like to deposit this in your account?
c18050 +++$+++ No.  The money, please.
c18050 +++$+++ This check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  That's a lot of cash to be carrying around.
c18050 +++$+++ Alright.  It's going to take a few minutes.  I have to call and verify the funds.
c18063 +++$+++ Talley?
c18063 +++$+++ I'm here.
c18063 +++$+++ I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
c18063 +++$+++ That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
c18063 +++$+++ The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
c08299 +++$+++ Something wrong?
c08299 +++$+++ Are you having an affair?
c08299 +++$+++ Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
c08299 +++$+++ Well, are you?
c08299 +++$+++ No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
c08299 +++$+++ If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
c08299 +++$+++ There's nothing to know, Ann.
c08299 +++$+++ I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
c08299 +++$+++ Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
c08299 +++$+++ My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
c08299 +++$+++ For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
c08299 +++$+++ Is that supposed to comfort me?
c08299 +++$+++ I was just saying, you know? I didn't get paranoid when you didn't want to make love. I could have easily assumed that you didn't want to because you were having an affair.
c08299 +++$+++ But I'm not.
c08299 +++$+++ I'm not either!!
c08299 +++$+++ Why don't I believe you?
c08299 +++$+++ Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
c08299 +++$+++ Always the lawyer.
c08299 +++$+++ Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
c08299 +++$+++ I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
c01578 +++$+++ Is there a problem?
c01578 +++$+++ No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
c01578 +++$+++ What shall we call him?
c11881 +++$+++ I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
c11881 +++$+++ What if you lost your keys?
c11881 +++$+++ Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
c11881 +++$+++ I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don't do anything. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone, don't go outside. Understand?
c07762 +++$+++ Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
c07762 +++$+++ Orvolle. His wine.  From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
c07762 +++$+++ -- and your meat shall be de-boned.
c11769 +++$+++ Oh yeah, what's that?
c11769 +++$+++ An alternative literary venue!
c11769 +++$+++ I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
c11769 +++$+++ No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
c11769 +++$+++ Squatted it.
c11769 +++$+++ So? DOUG Well, there's tons of empty buildings - why don't we get one?
c20661 +++$+++ He sucks soup through his front teeth.
c20661 +++$+++ A trademark move, don't touch it.
c20661 +++$+++ But he sure can kiss.
c20661 +++$+++ After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
c06315 +++$+++ That's your father's diary, Ann.
c06315 +++$+++ Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
c06315 +++$+++ You bet I will, Ma.
c15666 +++$+++ Will you not come in?
c15666 +++$+++ No.
c15666 +++$+++ Will you please come in?
c15666 +++$+++ Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
c15666 +++$+++ I believe you still have my book.
c00888 +++$+++ How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
c00888 +++$+++ It's...it's...all right.
c00888 +++$+++ Really? That's interesting.  Not great?
c00888 +++$+++ Oh well, you know.
c00888 +++$+++ Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
c06989 +++$+++ Can I help you?
c06989 +++$+++ You might hold this for me.
c06989 +++$+++ Love to.
c06989 +++$+++ Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
c06989 +++$+++ Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
c06989 +++$+++ No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
c06989 +++$+++ Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
c06989 +++$+++ I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
c06989 +++$+++ Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
c06989 +++$+++ Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it!  Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please.
c00323 +++$+++ Hello... ?
c00323 +++$+++ Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
c00323 +++$+++ I have to tell you something.  It won't be easy for you to hear.  It's about your daughter... Mary Anne...  When I... when I was there with you, her diary, in your attic, in silverware.  If you read it, you'll know what I'm telling you is true...
c15768 +++$+++ Right.
c15768 +++$+++ Because I never assume anything.
c15768 +++$+++ I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
c15768 +++$+++ Black of course.
c24846 +++$+++ I didn't expect anyone.
c24846 +++$+++ No reason.
c24846 +++$+++ Round about, yeah.
c24014 +++$+++ I'm very sorry to...
c24014 +++$+++ Well.  What seems to be the...?
c24014 +++$+++ I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
c24014 +++$+++ Could I see it please...?
c25462 +++$+++ Well you found him again and we're gonna have to do somethin' about it. What else haven't ya been tellin' me?
c25462 +++$+++ Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
c25462 +++$+++ Then why'd ya move outa your room?
c25462 +++$+++ You can't play your friends like marks, Hooker.
c08018 +++$+++ All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
c08018 +++$+++ To all those cons...
c08018 +++$+++ Searching for a money man...
c08018 +++$+++ We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
c08018 +++$+++ -- till he fucked his parole --
c08018 +++$+++ That's a book, baby.  That's a book of love.
c09223 +++$+++ We're not going to get a ride tonight.
c09223 +++$+++ I can't stay on this planet.
c09223 +++$+++ No one's traveling in this weather.
c09223 +++$+++ You promised you would get me to my ship.
c09223 +++$+++ I will. I will. We still have another day.
c09223 +++$+++ What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
c24867 +++$+++ I should really give him a call.  He's a character, isn't he.  Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
c24867 +++$+++ He give me your address.
c24867 +++$+++ I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
c24867 +++$+++ Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
c24867 +++$+++ Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.  Her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  We were always mates, me and Jenny's mum.  I like to think they're together again now.  Y'know.  Heavenly choir.
c12003 +++$+++ Was she ever a suspect?
c12003 +++$+++ Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
c12003 +++$+++ What kind of talk?
c12003 +++$+++ The usual -- a girlfriend.
c12003 +++$+++ He had a girlfriend?
c12003 +++$+++ Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
c12003 +++$+++ Thanks.
c12003 +++$+++ You did.
c07152 +++$+++ ...How'd you sleep?
c07152 +++$+++ I don't know. Had dreams.
c07152 +++$+++ Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
c07152 +++$+++ Well they always is to the party concerned.
c07152 +++$+++ Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
c15822 +++$+++ Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
c15822 +++$+++ No offense.  There are just some things we need that you probably didn't know to ask.
c15822 +++$+++ Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
c15822 +++$+++ Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for some of them.
c15822 +++$+++ Whose number do you need?
c15822 +++$+++ Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
c15822 +++$+++ You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
c13575 +++$+++ Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
c13575 +++$+++ Didn't we play this scene before?
c13575 +++$+++ I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
c05426 +++$+++ This smells good.
c05426 +++$+++ Why am I such an authority?
c05426 +++$+++ I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
c16872 +++$+++ So you've finally seen sense and come back to your old job, Vincent.
c16872 +++$+++ Not yet, I'm afraid.
c16872 +++$+++ No?  What's keeping you?
c16872 +++$+++ I guess I'm a slow learner.
c16872 +++$+++ I'll see what I can do.
c11687 +++$+++ It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
c11687 +++$+++ See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
c11687 +++$+++ Okay.
c25204 +++$+++ A drink to warm up?
c25204 +++$+++ Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
c25204 +++$+++ ... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
c17243 +++$+++ I want you gone, Randall. Settle your affairs. Make it right with those you love. Hell, take 'em with you. But I want you out of here. Out of here for good this time ...
c17243 +++$+++ Consider me gone, Detective --
c17243 +++$+++ I'll catch you later, Randall --
c17243 +++$+++ You betcha --
c24708 +++$+++ I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
c24708 +++$+++ What is this, Emmi?
c24708 +++$+++ I can't do this. It's not right.
c24708 +++$+++ What's not right?
c24708 +++$+++ I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
c24708 +++$+++ Emmi, stop! I want to show you something. Let me show you something and then if you want to leave, you can leave, please please. His friends, they did this. And he gave them birthday concerts.
c24708 +++$+++ But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
c24708 +++$+++ I would like to go now, please.
c13562 +++$+++ You're not Lenore Oberfeld.
c13562 +++$+++ There isn't any such person.
c13562 +++$+++ Whose money is this?
c13562 +++$+++ It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
c13562 +++$+++ The guy with the transplant.
c13562 +++$+++ Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
c13562 +++$+++ Damned if I know.
c13562 +++$+++ The video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and I'll bet there were enough witnesses.
c13562 +++$+++ At least one.
c13562 +++$+++ Plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
c13562 +++$+++ You timed that beautifully.
c13562 +++$+++ They always pick Rachel up early on Thursday.
c13562 +++$+++ I got what I fucking deserved.  I had it all.  I could've kept going!
c13562 +++$+++ As they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
c13562 +++$+++ And all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
c13562 +++$+++ There was <u>no</u> cop involved.  Oh shit!  Fuck!
c08874 +++$+++ You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
c08874 +++$+++ Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
c08874 +++$+++ Right.
c08874 +++$+++ Okay, Price. You stay.
c25282 +++$+++ Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
c25282 +++$+++ A coffee and a couple of croissants.
c25282 +++$+++ Crow what?
c25282 +++$+++ Croissants.
c25282 +++$+++ Croissants. Like that...
c06415 +++$+++ Need the disk back!
c06415 +++$+++ Insurance.
c06415 +++$+++ If she's alive, you get it back.
c06916 +++$+++ He lied!
c06916 +++$+++ Tricked us!
c06916 +++$+++ He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
c06916 +++$+++ He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
c20876 +++$+++ Peter... What do you think you're doing?
c20876 +++$+++ Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
c20876 +++$+++ Who?
c20876 +++$+++ Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
c20876 +++$+++ Perversity, darling. The enjoyment of the gratuitous act. Tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
c07352 +++$+++ I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
c07352 +++$+++ I can't risk it.
c07352 +++$+++ Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
c12921 +++$+++ Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?
c12921 +++$+++ It's...it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
c12921 +++$+++ Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
c12921 +++$+++ You were just a kid.
c12921 +++$+++ I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
c12921 +++$+++ Dead?  I don't think your past is dead.  It's alive.  And it bites.
c22247 +++$+++ Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
c22247 +++$+++ Speakest thou from thy heart?
c22247 +++$+++ And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
c22247 +++$+++ Amen
c22247 +++$+++ Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
c15871 +++$+++ Get out of here, Lando!
c15871 +++$+++ Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
c15871 +++$+++ Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
c19420 +++$+++ You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
c19420 +++$+++ No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
c19420 +++$+++ Yeah, like...
c19420 +++$+++ Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
c19420 +++$+++ It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
c19420 +++$+++ Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
c19420 +++$+++ I'm just temporarily off my game.
c19420 +++$+++ I believe in you.
c17297 +++$+++ We've got to help each other.
c17297 +++$+++ Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
c17297 +++$+++ It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
c17297 +++$+++ I can't do it anymore.
c17297 +++$+++ Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
c17297 +++$+++ I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
c17297 +++$+++ Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
c17297 +++$+++ Never.
c26735 +++$+++ I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
c26735 +++$+++ Did she believe you?
c26735 +++$+++ I have no idea.
c26735 +++$+++ Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
c25333 +++$+++ Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
c25333 +++$+++ That's a good idea, sire.
c25333 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c25333 +++$+++ ... if she can find me? -- That's a brilliant idea!  If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man!  Bring her up!
c24309 +++$+++ Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
c24309 +++$+++ Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
c24309 +++$+++ Yeah.
c24691 +++$+++ Yes.  It launches its ICBMs against their targets in Russia.
c24691 +++$+++ Why attack Russia?
c24691 +++$+++ Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
c24691 +++$+++ Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
c24691 +++$+++ I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
c18117 +++$+++ He did.
c18117 +++$+++ "Well rewarded" Those were his words.
c18117 +++$+++ The front gate would be best, General.
c14799 +++$+++ What happened?
c14799 +++$+++ I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
c14799 +++$+++ Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
c19184 +++$+++ How's astronaut training?
c19184 +++$+++ Why?  You going to give me hard time like the others?
c19184 +++$+++ Good...It's going good.
c11722 +++$+++ Nikita?  She helped me find you.
c11722 +++$+++ What?  How did you know I had a cat?
c11722 +++$+++ Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
c11722 +++$+++ Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
c11722 +++$+++ Yeah?
c00142 +++$+++ I speak English.
c00142 +++$+++ Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
c00142 +++$+++ New York.
c00142 +++$+++ Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
c00142 +++$+++ A cheap hotel.
c00142 +++$+++ What are you coming here to do?
c00142 +++$+++ I'm here for movies.
c00142 +++$+++ Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
c00142 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c10155 +++$+++ The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
c10155 +++$+++ Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
c10155 +++$+++ Grandpa traded with me.  Goodbye.
c21549 +++$+++ ...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.
c21549 +++$+++ ...don't feel like it either.
c21549 +++$+++ ...beautiful night.
c21549 +++$+++ That's a nice way of putting it.
c19203 +++$+++ Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
c19203 +++$+++ Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
c19203 +++$+++ It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
c11326 +++$+++ I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
c11326 +++$+++ I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
c11326 +++$+++ Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
c11326 +++$+++ Yeah.
c11326 +++$+++ Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
c11326 +++$+++ Oh, humdinger. When- Well, I got a wonderful idea. Why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider. You know, it's a-
c00141 +++$+++ I know.
c00141 +++$+++ What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
c00141 +++$+++ Well, he...
c00141 +++$+++ I want to hear everything he said.
c00141 +++$+++ I'm trying to tell you.
c00141 +++$+++ Alright.  Go ahead.
c00141 +++$+++ Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
c20465 +++$+++ Okay... but just...just to see.
c20465 +++$+++ Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
c20465 +++$+++ Come on... let's find you something to wear.
c21706 +++$+++ Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
c21706 +++$+++ Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
c21706 +++$+++ My name's Johnny Utah!
c21706 +++$+++ I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
c19921 +++$+++ I wanted to apologize, Susan --
c19921 +++$+++ I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
c19921 +++$+++ Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
c19921 +++$+++ It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
c19921 +++$+++ I appreciate you --
c19921 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c19921 +++$+++ And I appreciate you, too.
c13086 +++$+++ Listen .. um ... I don't want to get involved in any of this. But I work at the Ministry of Information, and I happen to know that Information Retrieval have been looking for an Archibald Tuttle, Heating Engineer. You wouldn't by any chance be -
c13086 +++$+++ My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
c13086 +++$+++ Time to go.
c09296 +++$+++ Her name is Karen Sumpter, from near Dell City. Just disappeared a couple weeks back. Vanished.
c09296 +++$+++ You're thinking...?
c09296 +++$+++ Who knows.
c09296 +++$+++ I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
c11392 +++$+++ Directing suits you.
c11392 +++$+++ I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
c11392 +++$+++ It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
c11392 +++$+++ Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
c11392 +++$+++ Just did.  Jealous?
c11392 +++$+++ Oh, very jealous.
c06656 +++$+++ Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life!  A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious!  You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
c06656 +++$+++ Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
c06656 +++$+++ I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
c24580 +++$+++ Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
c24580 +++$+++ Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
c24580 +++$+++ ...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
c24580 +++$+++ You believe that?
c24580 +++$+++ I have to.
c24580 +++$+++ Why?
c24580 +++$+++ Well I don't.
c07349 +++$+++ Call me during the week if you get the chance.
c07349 +++$+++ I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
c07349 +++$+++ I know that.
c22529 +++$+++ I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
c22529 +++$+++ Okay.
c22529 +++$+++ She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
c22529 +++$+++ Do you want a matrimonial, past wives, any kids--
c22529 +++$+++ No, I know that part --
c22529 +++$+++ So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
c22529 +++$+++ No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
c22529 +++$+++ A sense of humor.
c22529 +++$+++ I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
c22529 +++$+++ Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
c22529 +++$+++ You want a tail.  I got a guy in Seattle --
c20583 +++$+++ Why not now?
c20583 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c20583 +++$+++ How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
c20583 +++$+++ But what about you and the baby? You need me.
c20583 +++$+++ Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
c20583 +++$+++ Yeah, it would be kinda great.
c20583 +++$+++ It would be fantastic.
c20583 +++$+++ You leave your father to me.
c16896 +++$+++ How are you, Jerome?
c16896 +++$+++ Not bad, Jerome.
c16896 +++$+++ I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
c12150 +++$+++ You can't-.
c12150 +++$+++ Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
c12150 +++$+++ And when you finally get Two-Face?
c12198 +++$+++ Is Jenny gonna be okay?
c12198 +++$+++ She was wearing a helmet.  It could have been worse.
c12198 +++$+++ How the hell should I know?
c07956 +++$+++ Tell him why we moved here.
c07956 +++$+++ Hold it, Jim.
c07956 +++$+++ You can't protect me.
c07956 +++$+++ You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
c07956 +++$+++ Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
c27462 +++$+++ Your orders, Mr Vereker?
c27462 +++$+++ I'm to take the Sikali with the main column to the river
c27462 +++$+++ I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
c05048 +++$+++ What the hell are you doin'?
c05048 +++$+++ Get your clothes off.
c05048 +++$+++ Get your clothes off!
c23317 +++$+++ You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
c23317 +++$+++ Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
c23317 +++$+++ Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
c23317 +++$+++ Useless distractions.
c23317 +++$+++ It's like the Stone Age.  The room time forgot.  What about a phone?
c23317 +++$+++ And whom would you call?
c23317 +++$+++ Oh, I don't know... Satan?
c23317 +++$+++ Your cell is more than adequate.
c23317 +++$+++ Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping- Pong?  Row over to the monastery?
c23317 +++$+++ It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
c23317 +++$+++ Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
c23317 +++$+++ I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use this time, to think about my life.  And its direction.  Or lack thereof.
c23317 +++$+++ From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead.
c03557 +++$+++ Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
c03557 +++$+++ I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
c03557 +++$+++ Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
c03557 +++$+++ Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip.  A Louisiana flip.
c03557 +++$+++ Yes -- that --
c01149 +++$+++ And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do?
c01149 +++$+++ What do I do?
c01149 +++$+++ I'm a revolutionary.
c26107 +++$+++ Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
c26107 +++$+++ Hah.
c26107 +++$+++ When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
c15854 +++$+++ Captain Solo, sir. Might I have a word with you?
c15854 +++$+++ What is it?
c15854 +++$+++ Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
c15854 +++$+++ She is looking for Master Luke, and assumed he would be here with you.  No one seems to know ...
c08774 +++$+++ You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
c08774 +++$+++ Claire, will you calm down?
c08774 +++$+++ Claire...!
c18467 +++$+++ I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
c18467 +++$+++ And so could you -- crazy fool.
c18467 +++$+++ You stumbled into my hiding place.
c18467 +++$+++ Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I've never seen a dead body before.
c03544 +++$+++ Is that too much, Baron?
c03544 +++$+++ No -- not at all.
c03544 +++$+++ All right then.
c03856 +++$+++ Sorry I'm late.
c03856 +++$+++ A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
c03856 +++$+++ A block of ice.
c03856 +++$+++ Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
c03856 +++$+++ I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
c13710 +++$+++ Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
c13710 +++$+++ The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
c13710 +++$+++ Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
c13710 +++$+++ No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
c13710 +++$+++ Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
c26869 +++$+++ Oh, hell...
c26869 +++$+++ Susie?  Susie.  Are you alright...?  <u>Susie</u>...
c26869 +++$+++ Lemme talk to him.  Will?  Shoe?
c26869 +++$+++ Lemme talk to him.  Shoe?  Shoe...?  You in there...?
c03323 +++$+++ They didn't find anything?  In the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  So, what do I do now?
c03323 +++$+++ Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
c03323 +++$+++ I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
c03323 +++$+++ It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
c03323 +++$+++ Does she know anything about babies?
c03323 +++$+++ Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
c14276 +++$+++ Here it is.  <u>Conspiracy Theory</u>  It just went out Tuesday.  Third issue this year.  I bet I struck a nerve.  Pissed someone off.
c14276 +++$+++ 'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
c14276 +++$+++ Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
c14276 +++$+++ Absolutely not.  A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
c22792 +++$+++ My screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
c22792 +++$+++ Let us decide that.
c22792 +++$+++ It's under control.
c10225 +++$+++ Figured it out yet?
c10225 +++$+++ Figured out what?
c10225 +++$+++ Who is the best.
c10225 +++$+++ Nope.
c10225 +++$+++ Need a hint?
c10225 +++$+++ I think I can work it out on my own.
c10225 +++$+++ You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
c10225 +++$+++ And you were with Cougar. He was my roommate in flight school.
c20645 +++$+++ Is that your Dad?
c20645 +++$+++ Yes.
c20645 +++$+++ Who's that with your Dad?
c20645 +++$+++ It's my mother.
c20645 +++$+++ Do you remember her?
c20645 +++$+++ No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
c20645 +++$+++ What do you think it's like?
c20645 +++$+++ What?
c20645 +++$+++ Heaven.
c20645 +++$+++ I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
c20645 +++$+++ But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
c20645 +++$+++ That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.
c01361 +++$+++ I don't want to talk about it.
c01361 +++$+++ Why not?
c01361 +++$+++ Shut up. I'm not listening.
c01361 +++$+++ You don't want to talk about it.
c01361 +++$+++ Okay we won't talk about it.
c00031 +++$+++ I hear you're helpin' Verona.
c00031 +++$+++ Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
c00031 +++$+++ What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
c15905 +++$+++ I got an idea, Snake.  This looks like the prototype, right?
c15905 +++$+++ Yeah, kinda.
c15905 +++$+++ If he lets you get close enough.
c19230 +++$+++ Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
c19230 +++$+++ I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
c19230 +++$+++ Seven hundred each.
c27452 +++$+++ Are you ready for me?
c27452 +++$+++ MMMMmmmmm!
c27452 +++$+++ Ready for Fuchsmachen???
c27452 +++$+++ I love it when you're excited.  Come then, my Apfelstrudel!  Come into my arms and let me hold you.
c19850 +++$+++ ...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
c19850 +++$+++ Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
c19850 +++$+++ You're right.  You're right.  Look, I'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  You know that.
c26342 +++$+++ No police.
c26342 +++$+++ But, Senor--
c26342 +++$+++ No police!  Wait until I'm gone.
c26342 +++$+++ No police!
c14590 +++$+++ Stop it!  You don't deserve the Green Destiny.
c14590 +++$+++ Not another lecture!  On guard!
c14590 +++$+++ Only the sword will settle this.
c02782 +++$+++ Evening, gorgeous.
c02782 +++$+++ That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
c02782 +++$+++ Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
c24742 +++$+++ Reese...you got a first name?
c24742 +++$+++ Kyle.
c24742 +++$+++ White light.  Pain.  Like being ripped inside out... slowly.  Like being born, maybe.
c23523 +++$+++ How <u>is</u> your mother-in-law?
c23523 +++$+++ She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
c23523 +++$+++ The damage was considerable. But she's insured.  Thanks, again.
c12400 +++$+++ Stay in him forever?
c12400 +++$+++ No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
c12400 +++$+++ Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
c12400 +++$+++ No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
c12400 +++$+++ No one would ever have to know its not him.
c12400 +++$+++ Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
c22148 +++$+++ Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
c22148 +++$+++ One more round.
c22148 +++$+++ Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
c22148 +++$+++ ...Stop jivin'!
c22148 +++$+++ ...Thanks.
c24173 +++$+++ Can I have a glass of water?
c24173 +++$+++ Certainly - how about some breakfast?
c24173 +++$+++ Moffo!
c17084 +++$+++ What?
c17084 +++$+++ Kenilworth...?
c17084 +++$+++ I'm sorry...?
c17084 +++$+++ Oh, God...Oh, God...  Jim, excuse me...Ray, I told you, who he is is the senior vice- president American Express.  His family owns 32 per...Over the past years I've sold him...I can't tell you the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land.  I promised five weeks ago that I'd go to the wife's birthday party in Kenilworth tonight.  I have to go.  You understand. They treat me like a member of the family, so I have to go.
c08024 +++$+++ Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this?
c08024 +++$+++ Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
c08024 +++$+++ No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
c08024 +++$+++ Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
c27377 +++$+++ I wish I could go.
c27377 +++$+++ We all do.
c27377 +++$+++ Beast.
c07463 +++$+++ Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
c07463 +++$+++ For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
c07463 +++$+++ Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
c22641 +++$+++ Thanks for not judging me.
c22641 +++$+++ It's not my place.
c22641 +++$+++ The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
c26844 +++$+++ What is it?
c26844 +++$+++ President's speech.
c26844 +++$+++ No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
c05893 +++$+++ Good.
c05893 +++$+++ What if he refuses?
c05893 +++$+++ Brilliant!  Can anyone here fly a plane?
c04931 +++$+++ It'll be more than that.
c04931 +++$+++ Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
c04931 +++$+++ But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
c04931 +++$+++ Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
c04931 +++$+++ Where's the rest of it?
c04931 +++$+++ In the bag underneath.
c04931 +++$+++ What if he checks it?
c04931 +++$+++ He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
c04931 +++$+++ You're takin' a helluva chance kid.
c04931 +++$+++ Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
c04931 +++$+++ Then you're out and you get nothing.
c04931 +++$+++ Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
c04931 +++$+++ You're gonna have surveillance all over you.
c04931 +++$+++ That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
c04931 +++$+++ Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
c16181 +++$+++ No?
c16181 +++$+++ Do you have any idea what my life is like?
c16181 +++$+++ I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
c23357 +++$+++ If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
c23357 +++$+++ You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
c23357 +++$+++ Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
c23357 +++$+++ True enough.
c23357 +++$+++ Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.
c03683 +++$+++ Home is here in Grandma and Grandpa's new house.  At least while I'm in college. Remember our deal.
c03683 +++$+++ The kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
c03683 +++$+++ They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
c03683 +++$+++ But I've seen him!
c03683 +++$+++ You've been watching too much TV.
c03683 +++$+++ Like what?
c26262 +++$+++ You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
c26262 +++$+++ Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
c26262 +++$+++ That a fact?
c26262 +++$+++ I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
c26262 +++$+++ Maybe I do.
c26262 +++$+++ Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
c26262 +++$+++ I think I've heard that before.
c26262 +++$+++ What do you want for free?
c26262 +++$+++ You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
c26262 +++$+++ That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
c26262 +++$+++ Think you'll live that long?
c23841 +++$+++ Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
c23841 +++$+++ Why should I go?
c23841 +++$+++ You should know how it works.  Just in case.
c23841 +++$+++ In case you die, too?
c23841 +++$+++ I don't trust Harry to do it.
c23841 +++$+++ I fixed your suit.
c11434 +++$+++ Is there space here?
c11434 +++$+++ Yes.
c11434 +++$+++ No, no thanks.
c07758 +++$+++ Free his mouth.
c07758 +++$+++ Mustn't do that, sir.
c07758 +++$+++ I must grant him his last rites.
c07758 +++$+++ You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
c17887 +++$+++ is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
c17887 +++$+++ turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
c17887 +++$+++ Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
c21217 +++$+++ I'm so frightened.
c21217 +++$+++ You've got a right to be. We're trapped by a bunch of fiends.
c21217 +++$+++ Those creatures..!
c21217 +++$+++ Don't let them hear you.
c21217 +++$+++ I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
c15042 +++$+++ Sir, I took the liberty of running a GCI scenario on a TM-1 earlier today...
c15042 +++$+++ GCI.  TM-1.  What language are you talking?
c15042 +++$+++ Drop it.
c00241 +++$+++ She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
c00241 +++$+++ I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
c00241 +++$+++ Do you love her?
c00241 +++$+++ I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
c00241 +++$+++ I don't have time... I need to know.
c00241 +++$+++ I would like to have died in peace...
c16420 +++$+++ Can I ask you a question?
c16420 +++$+++ Sure.
c16420 +++$+++ I...I don't know.
c18573 +++$+++ Get a dance yet?
c18573 +++$+++ Nope.
c18573 +++$+++ Me neither.
c18573 +++$+++ Who'd you ask?
c18573 +++$+++ Tina Wilcox.
c18573 +++$+++ You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
c18573 +++$+++ Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
c18573 +++$+++ I know.
c11751 +++$+++ Yes.
c11751 +++$+++ Are you attracted to me?
c11751 +++$+++ Yes.
c11751 +++$+++ Why?
c11751 +++$+++ Why?  I don't know.
c11751 +++$+++ Both.
c04963 +++$+++ You told em? You told em it's me?
c04963 +++$+++ They already know it's you.
c04963 +++$+++ Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
c04963 +++$+++ Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
c04963 +++$+++ I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
c26212 +++$+++ Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
c26212 +++$+++ I got some money I can give you -
c26212 +++$+++ Keep it.
c26212 +++$+++ Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
c26212 +++$+++ Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
c08890 +++$+++ Data, you're not thinking about using that thing are you?
c08890 +++$+++ It has occurred to me on several occasions. But I believe this may be the appropriate time.
c08890 +++$+++ That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
c05101 +++$+++ Almost done.
c05101 +++$+++ Ow!
c05101 +++$+++ Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.
c12597 +++$+++ ...What was that back there?
c12597 +++$+++ Back where?
c12597 +++$+++ Sign.
c12597 +++$+++ I don't know. Motel... Abby--
c12597 +++$+++ Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
c12597 +++$+++ Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
c12597 +++$+++ Yeah.
c12597 +++$+++ Yeah.
c13615 +++$+++ Did he come here too?
c13615 +++$+++ Is this an obsession of yours?
c13615 +++$+++ Maybe.
c13615 +++$+++ Did he dance with you?
c13205 +++$+++ What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
c13205 +++$+++ Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
c13205 +++$+++ Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
c13205 +++$+++ Okay...It's so good to see you.
c12318 +++$+++ And look who you brought with!
c12318 +++$+++ Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
c12318 +++$+++ Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
c15875 +++$+++ Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
c15875 +++$+++ You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
c15875 +++$+++ What chance have we got in here? What are we going to do when they cut ...
c00674 +++$+++ Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
c00674 +++$+++ Okay.
c00674 +++$+++ A doper werewolf.
c04732 +++$+++ Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
c04732 +++$+++ What...?
c04732 +++$+++ She owes me a meal.
c04732 +++$+++ I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
c14365 +++$+++ Boss, I made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
c14365 +++$+++ Git your shovel and git to work.
c14365 +++$+++ I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
c14365 +++$+++ Git movin', I said.
c14365 +++$+++ Cut that backsass!
c18093 +++$+++ We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
c18093 +++$+++ Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
c18093 +++$+++ Run a DMV on the plate for the owner's name.
c12711 +++$+++ It's a family heirloom.
c12711 +++$+++ I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
c12711 +++$+++ Oh, I see.
c13602 +++$+++ Thank you.
c13602 +++$+++ Who the fuck is he?
c13602 +++$+++ Jimmy.
c13602 +++$+++ Maybe.
c13447 +++$+++ Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?
c13447 +++$+++ Go get a bag, man.
c13447 +++$+++ Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-
c09544 +++$+++ How was it?
c09544 +++$+++ Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
c09544 +++$+++ Was that Meredith?
c09544 +++$+++ Was who Meredith?
c09544 +++$+++ Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
c09544 +++$+++ Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
c09544 +++$+++ Didn't look that way -- you know -- from a distance.
c09544 +++$+++ I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen you.
c09544 +++$+++ Why lie?
c09544 +++$+++ Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
c09544 +++$+++ Or Tom and Peter even.
c09544 +++$+++ Well that would be even better gossip.
c09544 +++$+++ Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
c09544 +++$+++ I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
c09544 +++$+++ What do you mean lied about who you are?
c09544 +++$+++ I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
c09544 +++$+++ What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
c09544 +++$+++ Peter, I... I...
c09544 +++$+++ You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
c09954 +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
c09954 +++$+++ I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
c09954 +++$+++ [Beat] I don't know.
c14108 +++$+++ You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there.
c14108 +++$+++ Can I trouble you for one of those magazines?
c14108 +++$+++ No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter.
c17837 +++$+++ Yes!  God yes!  I would tell her that I love her!  To not let anyone take away her dreams..!

c04987 +++$+++ I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
c04987 +++$+++ Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
c04987 +++$+++ Not now, pick me up.
c21297 +++$+++ Take the next exit.
c21297 +++$+++ What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
c21297 +++$+++ No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
c03795 +++$+++ Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
c03795 +++$+++ You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
c03795 +++$+++ I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
c03795 +++$+++ If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
c03795 +++$+++ We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
c03795 +++$+++ Keep me informed of what he's up to. You help me, I'll help you.
c11051 +++$+++ You've already met.
c11051 +++$+++ Where?
c11051 +++$+++ That's nice.
c07520 +++$+++ Hey!
c07520 +++$+++ You don't want this.
c07520 +++$+++ Yeah, I do!
c07520 +++$+++ I like Trix!
c26577 +++$+++ I...please.  My wife...my wife's prescription has run out.  If I can call him...
c26577 +++$+++ Dr. Halpern's taking all his...
c26577 +++$+++ He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
c26623 +++$+++ Come here.
c26623 +++$+++ Oh, no. You'll muss me.
c26623 +++$+++ Too late. I've got my face on.
c07989 +++$+++ Get lost.
c07989 +++$+++ Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
c07989 +++$+++ Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
c11498 +++$+++ Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
c11498 +++$+++ Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
c11498 +++$+++ That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
c11498 +++$+++ I don't understand --
c11498 +++$+++ I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
c12529 +++$+++ Are you all right?
c12529 +++$+++ I've been better --
c12529 +++$+++ I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
c09569 +++$+++ Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
c09569 +++$+++ For a fee.
c09569 +++$+++ For a fee.
c09569 +++$+++ I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
c09569 +++$+++ Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
c09569 +++$+++ Support my kids. Can you dig it?  Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me.
c07294 +++$+++ Five... hunnert... thousand... each.
c07294 +++$+++ Four hundred, Delmar.
c07294 +++$+++ What're you gonna do with your share of the treasure, Pete?
c18971 +++$+++ What do you like best about her?
c18971 +++$+++ Lunch in a restaurant.
c18971 +++$+++ What do you like best about your daddy?
c18971 +++$+++ Tell me, does your daddy ever hit you?
c25457 +++$+++ Aw right, he runs the numbers outta the south side.
c25457 +++$+++ And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
c25457 +++$+++ I'll take him anyway.
c25457 +++$+++ 'Cause I don't know enough about killin' to kill him.
c18097 +++$+++ Slow down, Thomas.  Take it easy and talk to me.  Was your father shot?
c18097 +++$+++ Dennis hit him.  His head's all big and he won't wake up.  I'm really scared.
c18097 +++$+++ How about you and your sister?
c18097 +++$+++ We're okay.
c18097 +++$+++ In my room.
c09608 +++$+++ What.
c09608 +++$+++ No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
c09608 +++$+++ Me too.
c09608 +++$+++ You look... different.
c09608 +++$+++ I do?
c09608 +++$+++ I did?  Huh!
c22081 +++$+++ Our resignations.
c22081 +++$+++ You going rogue on me?
c22081 +++$+++ Maybe.
c22081 +++$+++ What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
c22081 +++$+++ There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
c09790 +++$+++ Did all these people die in wars?
c09790 +++$+++ Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
c09790 +++$+++ No -- I'm afraid not.
c09790 +++$+++ Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
c09790 +++$+++ I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
c09790 +++$+++ They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars.
c00251 +++$+++ Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
c00251 +++$+++ What mission?
c00251 +++$+++ To save the world.
c00251 +++$+++ Where have I heard this song before?
c00251 +++$+++ You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
c00251 +++$+++ Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
c03708 +++$+++ Hello.
c03708 +++$+++ How are you, honeybunch?
c03708 +++$+++ Is Penelope in?
c03708 +++$+++ The posies are for her?
c03708 +++$+++ I wanted to apologize.
c03708 +++$+++ You've come to the right man.
c03708 +++$+++ I forgot my vacuum cleaner.
c03708 +++$+++ Oh my God--  And you are Looseleaf Harper.
c26270 +++$+++ You want somethin'?
c26270 +++$+++ You Harlin?
c26270 +++$+++ Nope.  Darrell.
c26270 +++$+++ He's up at the Look Out.
c09177 +++$+++ Yes.
c09177 +++$+++ So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
c09177 +++$+++ But you want to.
c02673 +++$+++ Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
c02673 +++$+++ What class?
c02673 +++$+++ Really?
c01407 +++$+++ How you feelin' today?
c01407 +++$+++ You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
c01407 +++$+++ I know that.
c01407 +++$+++ Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
c01407 +++$+++ Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
c01407 +++$+++ No, you do it. I can't sing.
c01407 +++$+++ Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
c01407 +++$+++ Get a good picture in your mind.
c11854 +++$+++ I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
c11854 +++$+++ I should have told you sooner --
c11854 +++$+++ No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
c07338 +++$+++ Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
c07338 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c07338 +++$+++ You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
c07338 +++$+++ No way... Would you?
c07338 +++$+++ I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
c07338 +++$+++ That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
c07338 +++$+++ No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
c07338 +++$+++ I do.
c08873 +++$+++ What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
c08873 +++$+++ Says who?
c08873 +++$+++ Says me.
c08873 +++$+++ Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
c09070 +++$+++ I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
c09070 +++$+++ What are they interested in...?
c09070 +++$+++ You should feel right at home with them.
c05034 +++$+++ I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
c05034 +++$+++ Whataya mean, no record?
c05034 +++$+++ You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
c05034 +++$+++ That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
c05034 +++$+++ Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
c14217 +++$+++ What kind of question?
c14217 +++$+++ Jazz question.  What other kind is there?  You get it right, we roll with it.  You disappear.  Tonight.  You don't go home, you don't pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, I mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
c14217 +++$+++ I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
c02990 +++$+++ Sir, it's you  Thank Ipthar!
c02990 +++$+++ Quellek. What are you doing in there?
c02990 +++$+++ Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
c11646 +++$+++ Stay still.
c11646 +++$+++ Where's my ELT?
c11646 +++$+++ Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
c11646 +++$+++ You got one?
c11646 +++$+++ Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
c18032 +++$+++ Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
c18032 +++$+++ No.
c18032 +++$+++ Why not?
c18032 +++$+++ You don't really believe this do you?
c14850 +++$+++ You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
c14850 +++$+++ I'm... not... nobody...
c14850 +++$+++ Well, maybe I am.  But you're fired.
c16713 +++$+++ ...WB2YXB calling unidentified station, Queens.  CQ 15.
c16713 +++$+++ Hello?
c16713 +++$+++ I been Q-ing you all night.  How the hell did you do it?
c16713 +++$+++ Huh?
c16713 +++$+++ The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
c16713 +++$+++ Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
c16713 +++$+++ This afternoon?
c07465 +++$+++ We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
c07465 +++$+++ No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
c07465 +++$+++ Give me the cat. I'll take care of it myself.
c00388 +++$+++ How about a Big Mac?
c00388 +++$+++ Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
c00388 +++$+++ C'mon, we can always sneak a Big Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your favorite. What do you say?
c00388 +++$+++ No.
c00388 +++$+++ What do you want, then?
c00388 +++$+++ Nothing.
c00388 +++$+++ You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
c00388 +++$+++ Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
c00388 +++$+++ Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
c15532 +++$+++ Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
c15532 +++$+++ I got a few Nite Owl questions.
c15532 +++$+++ I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
c15532 +++$+++ I'm tying up loose ends.  Padding my report.  You know how it goes.
c15532 +++$+++ What do you want to know?
c15532 +++$+++ You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous?  I can't think of anything.
c16043 +++$+++ Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
c16043 +++$+++ Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
c16043 +++$+++ Right.
c16043 +++$+++ I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
c16043 +++$+++ Yeah, fine.
c16043 +++$+++ Sure.
c14883 +++$+++ You know, secretaries and stiff.
c14883 +++$+++ You find people jobs?
c14883 +++$+++ Yeah.  Is that funny?
c14883 +++$+++ Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it.
c14387 +++$+++ I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
c14387 +++$+++ Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
c14387 +++$+++ I had the dream again.  And I got another call.  This time he spoke.  He said "You and me, you and me."
c14387 +++$+++ He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him!
c09892 +++$+++ The 2005 terraforming demolitions for the lunar excavations sent the moon into a diminishing retrograde orbit resulting in global gravitational fluctuations, increased seismic activity and tidal anomalies.  Can I tell you more?
c09892 +++$+++ No -- wait -- the moon's falling out of orbit -- that's not possible!
c09892 +++$+++ Well, considering it is, in fact, happening, I would assume it's possible.  The retrograde orbit began in 2005 when the demolitions for the lunar colonies --
c09892 +++$+++ I was getting to that... The moon has reached the gravitational Roche Limit, 7,300 miles above the surface of the Earth.  This has created pressure on the lunar stratum beyond gravitational tolerances.  It might be helpful to know that the nearest public evacuation shelters can be found at Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden --
c08641 +++$+++ Are you nodding?
c08641 +++$+++ Yeah.
c08641 +++$+++ I can't hear when you're nodding.
c08641 +++$+++ We'll be there in ten minutes.
c03285 +++$+++ I do need to see Starling.
c03285 +++$+++ Starling?
c03285 +++$+++ Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
c03285 +++$+++ Well, I need to speak to him.
c24884 +++$+++ Ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  Wow.
c24884 +++$+++ Good luck.
c24884 +++$+++ Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
c24884 +++$+++ Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
c24884 +++$+++ ... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal.
c24884 +++$+++ Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
c24884 +++$+++ Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
c24884 +++$+++ Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good?
c24884 +++$+++ Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
c24884 +++$+++ The L.A.P.D.
c19043 +++$+++ The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
c19043 +++$+++ So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
c19043 +++$+++ Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
c19043 +++$+++ Can India help us?
c19043 +++$+++ India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
c19043 +++$+++ Britain?
c19043 +++$+++ Britain chooses not to.
c19043 +++$+++ And, America?
c19043 +++$+++ Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
c01567 +++$+++ According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
c01567 +++$+++ Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
c01567 +++$+++ Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
c01567 +++$+++ What about relatives?
c01567 +++$+++ All back East.
c01567 +++$+++ The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
c01567 +++$+++ He drank it hot?
c01567 +++$+++ Yeah.
c01567 +++$+++ Yeah.
c15300 +++$+++ It was Jessica. That girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
c15300 +++$+++ JESSICA. Are you sure?
c15300 +++$+++ She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
c15300 +++$+++ Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
c15300 +++$+++ Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
c22848 +++$+++ Basements creep me out.
c22848 +++$+++ Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic.
c22848 +++$+++ Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do.
c22848 +++$+++ Bitch.
c12448 +++$+++ And this is the study.  You can see the various commendations, honorary degrees, et cetera.
c12448 +++$+++ Yes, uh, very impressive.
c12448 +++$+++ Please, feel free to inspect them.
c12448 +++$+++ I'm not really, uh.
c12448 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c08780 +++$+++ What a memory.
c08780 +++$+++ Do you dance?
c08780 +++$+++ Do you?
c08780 +++$+++ Let's do it.
c05589 +++$+++ Can you show us the way?
c05589 +++$+++ To Castle Couer de Noir?
c05589 +++$+++ That very nice.
c24420 +++$+++ Hi.
c24420 +++$+++ Hello. Are you still mad at me?
c24420 +++$+++ I'm not mad at you.
c24420 +++$+++ It seemed that way to me.
c24420 +++$+++ I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
c24420 +++$+++ What I had before. What's not there now. It's like I woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. It was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
c03457 +++$+++ I'm putting it here by the door.
c03457 +++$+++ Will you bring it in to me?
c03457 +++$+++ I'd rather not.
c03457 +++$+++ Right.
c04798 +++$+++ What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
c04798 +++$+++ Why not? I'm hungry.
c04798 +++$+++ Eat a carrot.
c04798 +++$+++ If you do, I'll break your neck.
c14138 +++$+++ Jessie!  Are you alright?
c14138 +++$+++ I want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. Don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. Copy?
c14138 +++$+++ Love's a killer, isn't it?
c06102 +++$+++ And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a toe-down.
c06102 +++$+++ That's what it is. Walk on out.
c06102 +++$+++ Now.
c14204 +++$+++ How many to a cell?
c14204 +++$+++ Four in this block, sir.
c14204 +++$+++ Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
c14204 +++$+++ Not a chance, my dear fellow. The Ggovernment can't be concerned any longer with outmoded penological theories. Soon we may be needing all of out prison space for political offenders. Common criminals like these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis. Kill the criminal reflex that's all. Full implementation in a year's time. Punishment means nothing to them, you can see that... they enjoy their so-called punishment. Alex seizes his chance as they pass by.
c01532 +++$+++ What about her?
c01532 +++$+++ No way.
c01532 +++$+++ Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
c01532 +++$+++ Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
c01532 +++$+++ Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
c01532 +++$+++ How 'bout this one?
c04631 +++$+++ What's wrong?
c04631 +++$+++ They're killing the Wigand interview...
c04631 +++$+++ What?!
c04631 +++$+++ They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
c04631 +++$+++ What are you and Mike going to do?
c04631 +++$+++ Oh, baby...
c18259 +++$+++ ...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
c18259 +++$+++ Well, maybe I --
c18259 +++$+++ An' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she, uh -- when she don't, uh -- How'd that go?
c18259 +++$+++ It's hardly the same --
c18259 +++$+++ Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
c18259 +++$+++ Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
c18259 +++$+++ I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
c18259 +++$+++ I'm happy enough.
c18259 +++$+++ I'm plenty happy!
c16289 +++$+++ ...Dad?
c16289 +++$+++ Yah.
c16289 +++$+++ Stan Grossman called.
c16289 +++$+++ Yah, okay.
c16289 +++$+++ Twice.
c16289 +++$+++ Okay.
c16289 +++$+++ Yah.
c20365 +++$+++ Well, look er, I ...
c20365 +++$+++ What is your name, handsome knight?
c20365 +++$+++ Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
c01799 +++$+++ Who else knows about this?
c01799 +++$+++ Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
c01799 +++$+++ Okay...
c04003 +++$+++ I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
c04003 +++$+++ No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
c04003 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
c04003 +++$+++ Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
c04003 +++$+++ "-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
c04003 +++$+++ Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
c02775 +++$+++ Shit. I meant the other way around.
c02775 +++$+++ Well, the studio told me not to.
c02775 +++$+++ Is that why you did it?
c02775 +++$+++ Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
c02775 +++$+++ You're telling me.
c02775 +++$+++ Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
c02775 +++$+++ Forget it.
c24817 +++$+++ Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
c24817 +++$+++ Uh... Nell Vance...
c24817 +++$+++ And what kind of sleeper?
c24817 +++$+++ Obsessive worrier.  Join the club.  And you?  I'd guess...
c21900 +++$+++ I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
c21900 +++$+++ It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
c21900 +++$+++ No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
c21900 +++$+++ He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
c21900 +++$+++ I ought to call the police right now!
c21900 +++$+++ No.
c21900 +++$+++ Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
c21900 +++$+++ How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
c21900 +++$+++ She haven't even called you?
c21900 +++$+++ I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
c21900 +++$+++ I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
c21900 +++$+++ You've led a charmed life.
c21900 +++$+++ No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
c21900 +++$+++ Maybe we can handle it together.
c21900 +++$+++ I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
c21900 +++$+++ I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
c21900 +++$+++ You want me to stay here?
c21900 +++$+++ She'll need both of us.
c21900 +++$+++ First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
c01372 +++$+++ I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
c01372 +++$+++ No. I think I better just go.
c01372 +++$+++ Whatever.
c17053 +++$+++ ...it isn't you...?  Who is it? Who is this I'm talking to?  I need the leads...
c17053 +++$+++ ...after the thirtieth...
c17053 +++$+++ Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
c17053 +++$+++ Murray...
c17053 +++$+++ ...you talk to Murray...
c17053 +++$+++ I have.  And my job is to marshal those leads...
c17053 +++$+++ Marshal the leads...marshal the leads?  What the fuck, what bus did you get off of, we're here to fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the leads.  What the fuck talk is that? What the fuck talk is that?  Where did you learn that?  In school?  That's "talk," my friend, that's "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm the man to sell.  I'm getting garbage.  You're giving it to me, and what I'm saying is it's fucked.
c17053 +++$+++ You're saying that I'm fucked.
c17053 +++$+++ Let me...
c00119 +++$+++ Detective, does it look like a murder?
c00119 +++$+++ We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
c00119 +++$+++ How many victims are up there?
c00119 +++$+++ There are two bodies found at this point.
c00119 +++$+++ Can we go up to the crime scene?
c00119 +++$+++ You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
c00119 +++$+++ We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
c08673 +++$+++ I'm all ears, good buddy.
c08673 +++$+++ You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
c08673 +++$+++ We'll be waiting. Over.
c06307 +++$+++ Who?
c06307 +++$+++ John Doe, the one in the speech.
c06307 +++$+++ You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
c21772 +++$+++ Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
c21772 +++$+++ Was that you?
c21772 +++$+++ Who did you think?
c21772 +++$+++ Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
c21772 +++$+++ Yeah.  I just got it.
c11924 +++$+++ I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
c11924 +++$+++ The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
c11924 +++$+++ Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
c11924 +++$+++ No, I don't.
c20844 +++$+++ What's this?
c20844 +++$+++ Could be your A.I.'s calling card.
c20844 +++$+++ No, but it traced me.
c13480 +++$+++ - back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
c13480 +++$+++ Listen...
c13480 +++$+++ ...they're in Penthouse K.
c13480 +++$+++ They check in alone?
c13480 +++$+++ They checked in alone.
c13480 +++$+++ Are they out now?
c13480 +++$+++ All right.
c23555 +++$+++ Oh - Sugar!
c23555 +++$+++ I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
c23555 +++$+++ It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
c23555 +++$+++ If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
c23555 +++$+++ It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
c23555 +++$+++ Oh, I can think of a million things -
c13043 +++$+++ OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
c13043 +++$+++ B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
c13043 +++$+++ Christ! You do know it all!
c13043 +++$+++ No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
c13043 +++$+++ Well, your A. Buttle has been confused with T47/215, an A. Tuttle. I mean, it's a joke! Somebody should be shot for that. So B58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
c13043 +++$+++ You got the wrong man.
c13043 +++$+++ I did not get the wrong man. I got the right man. The wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! I accepted him, on trust, as the right man. Was I wrong? Anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. Which, had he been the right man, he wouldn't have done.
c13043 +++$+++ You killed him?
c13043 +++$+++ Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
c13043 +++$+++ I'm sure you have
c13043 +++$+++ There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
c13043 +++$+++ So how ...?
c13043 +++$+++ What I've got to do now is pick up Tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as Buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
c13043 +++$+++ What has Tuttle done?
c13043 +++$+++ We suspect him of freelance subversion.
c13043 +++$+++ He's a compulsive heating engineer. A maverick ex-Central Service repair man with a grudge against society. Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of the wood, I think. At least we will be when I get this Layton woman under arrest.
c17783 +++$+++ I said how's your baby...?
c17783 +++$+++ You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
c17783 +++$+++ 'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
c10579 +++$+++ I'm scared, mama.
c10579 +++$+++ Why, honey?
c10579 +++$+++ Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
c04752 +++$+++ might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I--
c04752 +++$+++ Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
c04752 +++$+++ Why should she? After all--
c04752 +++$+++ All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement--that you've had a talk with me--that we've reached an understanding--that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
c04752 +++$+++ Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to--  --as long as I can get her back.
c23238 +++$+++ Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
c23238 +++$+++ No, Dad.
c23238 +++$+++ Yes, Dad.
c25749 +++$+++ You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
c25749 +++$+++ I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
c25749 +++$+++ It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
c25749 +++$+++ I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
c00465 +++$+++ No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
c00465 +++$+++ If that's the way you want it.
c00465 +++$+++ Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
c23818 +++$+++ I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She can be drastic.
c23818 +++$+++ How drastic?
c23818 +++$+++ You don't want to know.
c23818 +++$+++ I think I do.
c23818 +++$+++ A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
c23818 +++$+++ She should've known better.
c23818 +++$+++ She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
c23818 +++$+++ When was this?
c23818 +++$+++ '81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
c23818 +++$+++ So you knew this when you wrote your report?
c23818 +++$+++ At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
c23818 +++$+++ You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
c23818 +++$+++ Wait a second --
c23818 +++$+++ -- and then brought her down here --
c23818 +++$+++ -- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."
c22856 +++$+++ What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
c22856 +++$+++ SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
c22856 +++$+++ I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
c19182 +++$+++ Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
c19182 +++$+++ How do you know it was Williams?
c19182 +++$+++ All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
c26983 +++$+++ I don't need a shrink.
c26983 +++$+++ Harvey says he's amazing.
c26983 +++$+++ What can it hurt to talk to someone?
c14924 +++$+++ Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?
c14924 +++$+++ No.
c14924 +++$+++ Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
c14924 +++$+++ I gotta find Chet.  Make yourself at home.
c25277 +++$+++ Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
c25277 +++$+++ I didn't know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? I've known for five years. He's known I've known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn't speak about...
c25277 +++$+++ One just doesn't... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
c25277 +++$+++ Think what you like. But don't presume to understand.
c25277 +++$+++ I don't.
c25277 +++$+++ Good.
c25277 +++$+++ Is there anything to understand?
c25277 +++$+++ Why do I feel I needn't answer that?
c25277 +++$+++ Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
c25277 +++$+++ You bastard...
c25277 +++$+++ Five years of it. Surely, you'd have divorced him if he disgusted you?
c25277 +++$+++ You splendid bastard...
c25277 +++$+++ Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
c25277 +++$+++ ...We're turning in circles.
c25277 +++$+++ And you still haven't told me why you sent me after Friedman.
c25277 +++$+++ Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
c25277 +++$+++ A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
c25277 +++$+++ I didn't know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
c25277 +++$+++ What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier's being tailed?
c25277 +++$+++ Something like that.
c25277 +++$+++ Something like that?
c25277 +++$+++ Something like that.
c25277 +++$+++ What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
c25277 +++$+++ Here we go again.
c25277 +++$+++ Where is that?
c25277 +++$+++ Simplify and damn.
c25277 +++$+++ Don't you believe in simplicity?
c25277 +++$+++ Should I?
c25277 +++$+++ We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it's never that complicated really.
c25277 +++$+++ You seem to know what you're talking about.
c25277 +++$+++ Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
c25277 +++$+++ My husband didn't need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
c25277 +++$+++ To get me killed...?
c25277 +++$+++ I didn't intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you'd been back.  That we'd argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn't help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
c25277 +++$+++ Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That's when he hit me, and told me he'd killed my brother... "You don't know what you've done," he said.  "We're in deep trouble," he said. "We," he said. "We."  We'd both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
c05459 +++$+++ Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
c05459 +++$+++ Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
c05459 +++$+++ I guess I do too.
c05459 +++$+++ You what?
c05459 +++$+++ I sometimes fade out.
c05459 +++$+++ You were going to get my door.
c06452 +++$+++ And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
c06452 +++$+++ That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
c06452 +++$+++ Didn't know you felt that way.
c14511 +++$+++ No.
c14511 +++$+++ Especially this last year.
c14511 +++$+++ So, I've been thinking a lot...
c18567 +++$+++ I'm showing summer rentals.  We got a helluva season going.
c18567 +++$+++ We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
c18567 +++$+++ Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
c11741 +++$+++ You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
c11741 +++$+++ Okay.  Then what?
c11741 +++$+++ Then, we wait.
c11741 +++$+++ It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.
c18128 +++$+++ What do you mean George?
c18128 +++$+++ Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
c18128 +++$+++ Why not? We are half way there already.
c00745 +++$+++ Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
c00745 +++$+++ I haven't any.
c00745 +++$+++ You haven't got a uniform?
c00745 +++$+++ No, sir.
c00745 +++$+++ My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
c00745 +++$+++ You see Sampson. Tell him I sent you. You've got to have a uniform.
c04013 +++$+++ He's got one!
c04013 +++$+++ On Clark Street!
c04013 +++$+++ A couple blocks!  About six!
c04013 +++$+++ You'd love it!
c22943 +++$+++ It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
c22943 +++$+++ Him?
c22943 +++$+++ For a long time, the F.B.I.'s been hooked into the library system, keeping accurate records.
c22943 +++$+++ What?  Assessing fines?
c22943 +++$+++ They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
c22943 +++$+++ You got to be kidding.
c22943 +++$+++ Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
c22943 +++$+++ Legal... illegal.  These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.
c20469 +++$+++ Don't stop!
c20469 +++$+++ What is it? What do you see?!
c20469 +++$+++ Those men in front, in the car.
c20469 +++$+++ Do you know them?!
c20469 +++$+++ Keep going. Go around to the back.
c07355 +++$+++ Thanks for covering for me.
c07355 +++$+++ No problem, but who's Susan?
c07355 +++$+++ My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
c07355 +++$+++ I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
c07355 +++$+++ She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
c07355 +++$+++ Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel.  Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist?
c01177 +++$+++ How did you know?
c01177 +++$+++ It hit me like a ton of bricks.
c01177 +++$+++ The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what?
c12171 +++$+++ Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
c12171 +++$+++ What are you, scared of heights?
c12171 +++$+++ I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
c12171 +++$+++ Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
c12171 +++$+++ That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
c12171 +++$+++ Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
c12171 +++$+++ No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
c14872 +++$+++ Something like what...
c14872 +++$+++ Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
c14872 +++$+++ The Fidelity nonsense...
c14872 +++$+++ All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
c14872 +++$+++ They re not my attack dogs.
c14872 +++$+++ I just fired Bob Alexander.
c14493 +++$+++ It's a good thing my family loves you.
c14493 +++$+++ Your family just met me.
c14493 +++$+++ You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, "It's a good thing I love you."
c14493 +++$+++ Do you?
c14493 +++$+++ I do.
c14493 +++$+++ Michael, I...
c14493 +++$+++ But I do.     I love you, too.
c06067 +++$+++ Hey, boys.
c06067 +++$+++ Tom. How's it going?
c06067 +++$+++ Fine, fine. And you were...?
c06067 +++$+++ Right, right. The 'thugs.'
c17615 +++$+++ Jamie, what happened?
c17615 +++$+++ It was the nightmare man
c17615 +++$+++ He's coming to get me Rachel.
c12107 +++$+++ He's dying.  And I can't deal with it.
c12107 +++$+++ But he's never said a word-
c12107 +++$+++ You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
c12107 +++$+++ I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
c04570 +++$+++ What are you doing here, where've you been?
c04570 +++$+++ I have a new client.
c04570 +++$+++ Yes. Joe.
c19417 +++$+++ Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.
c19417 +++$+++ Bad?
c19417 +++$+++ Weird.  The book again.  Sex spelled backwards...
c19417 +++$+++ I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
c19417 +++$+++ Sushi.
c20400 +++$+++ I promised to protect her from people like you.
c20400 +++$+++ For once in my life, I am not the issue.
c20400 +++$+++ She'll never understand it.
c20400 +++$+++ In time, she will.
c20400 +++$+++ But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
c04567 +++$+++ If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
c04567 +++$+++ Who's our little man?
c04567 +++$+++ Me.
c04567 +++$+++ I take the last chip in with me. I use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.
c21356 +++$+++ Welcome to the singles scene.
c21356 +++$+++ I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
c21356 +++$+++ You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
c21356 +++$+++ So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
c24724 +++$+++ Major.
c24724 +++$+++ Helmuth.
c24724 +++$+++ Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
c20200 +++$+++ Ethan, you know what frightens me most when I'm with him?..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here?
c20200 +++$+++ Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
c20200 +++$+++ No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
c11959 +++$+++ Barton. Are you all right?
c11959 +++$+++ No... Can I come in?
c11959 +++$+++ Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
c06586 +++$+++ His first 'whiff'!
c06586 +++$+++ Such pretty knees for a big boy!
c06586 +++$+++ Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
c09476 +++$+++ Yeah.
c09476 +++$+++ Do you recognize my voice?
c09476 +++$+++ I think so.  Detective squad?
c09476 +++$+++ Right.  Don't say my name, just listen.  Somebody shot your father outside his place fifteen minutes ago.
c09476 +++$+++ Is he alive?
c09476 +++$+++ Find out anything you can...you got a Grand coming.
c16737 +++$+++ So how'd you like LION KING?
c16737 +++$+++ Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
c16737 +++$+++ I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
c16737 +++$+++ Look who's talking.
c06250 +++$+++ Oh, he'll get married, don't worry, Aunt Theresa.
c06250 +++$+++ Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
c06250 +++$+++ Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
c06250 +++$+++ Right.
c17376 +++$+++ I just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, I gotta go see about a girl."
c17376 +++$+++ "I gotta go see about a girl"? What did they say?
c17376 +++$+++ They could see that I meant it.
c17376 +++$+++ No Will, I'm not kiddin' you. If I had gone to see that game I'd be in here talkin' abouta girl I saw at a bar twenty years ago. And how I always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. I don't regret the eighteen years we were married. I don't regret givin' up couseling for six years when she got sick. I don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. And I sure as Hell don't regret missing that damn game.
c26876 +++$+++ Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize it's big game hunters that bag the elephants, not retail brokers. I heard this story about Gekko... he was on the phone 30 seconds after the Challenger blew up selling NASA stocks short.
c26876 +++$+++ Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's right, and you know everyday I say to myself, today could be the day... So what do you say... will you marry me? Then please can you get me through to Mr. Gekko?
c26876 +++$+++ Of course he's busy, and so am I. Five minutes. That's all I'm asking. I know that if he could only hear what I have to say... it would change his life.
c24260 +++$+++ Can you tell me what happened?
c24260 +++$+++ He's drunk.
c24260 +++$+++ He causes problems. He was here earlier.
c13638 +++$+++ Yes.
c13638 +++$+++ I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
c13638 +++$+++ Did you hear me?
c21207 +++$+++ It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
c21207 +++$+++ Aw, Johnny... .
c21207 +++$+++ I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
c21207 +++$+++ Nothing happened, Johnny.
c21207 +++$+++ Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
c21207 +++$+++ It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
c21207 +++$+++ Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
c21207 +++$+++ You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
c21207 +++$+++ He don't, huh?  Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
c21207 +++$+++ I got it. Hot off the press.
c13329 +++$+++ Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
c13329 +++$+++ Well, I held it like an egg.
c13329 +++$+++ An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
c13329 +++$+++ I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
c13329 +++$+++ He did know.
c13329 +++$+++ I told him.
c13691 +++$+++ You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
c13691 +++$+++ Can you remember anything at all?
c13691 +++$+++ Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
c13691 +++$+++ With whom? Where?
c13691 +++$+++ I think it only said where -- but I can't --
c13691 +++$+++ Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
c13691 +++$+++ That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
c13691 +++$+++ Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
c13691 +++$+++ Of course there is!
c13691 +++$+++ Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't --  Hold it. I'm on.
c19298 +++$+++ Mami, how old were you when my father--
c19298 +++$+++ He was killed.
c19298 +++$+++ Right. When he was killed.
c19298 +++$+++ How come you never got married again?
c11796 +++$+++ Well, he should be on his way back to his apartment by now.
c11796 +++$+++ Do you know the way?
c11796 +++$+++ Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
c11796 +++$+++ No, by road?
c11796 +++$+++ Good we'll take Josh's Jeep, come on!
c18860 +++$+++ Hello?
c18860 +++$+++ Who is this? What's going on?
c18860 +++$+++ Where's Ken? Is he all right?
c03372 +++$+++ Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
c03372 +++$+++ They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
c03372 +++$+++ I couldn't do that.  You might hurt someone.
c16727 +++$+++ John, you still there?
c16727 +++$+++ I'm right here, Dad.
c16727 +++$+++ You all right?
c16727 +++$+++ Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
c19482 +++$+++ I want to ride my own bike.
c19482 +++$+++ My Dad always drives my Mom.
c19482 +++$+++ So that means I have to ride with you.
c10547 +++$+++ Phil.  What are you doing?
c10547 +++$+++ Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
c10547 +++$+++ Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
c02003 +++$+++ God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
c02003 +++$+++ It's me.
c02003 +++$+++ I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
c19339 +++$+++ Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
c19339 +++$+++ Why did you wait so long?
c19339 +++$+++ I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
c19339 +++$+++ And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
c19339 +++$+++ If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
c19339 +++$+++ Maybe he'll show you.
c11781 +++$+++ I'd love to get in there.
c11781 +++$+++ Don't we have enough already?
c11781 +++$+++ It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
c11781 +++$+++ And suppose a little old lady lives there?
c11781 +++$+++ No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
c11781 +++$+++ Just think though, it would make a hell of a cafe, that way we keep the auditorium clear.
c05933 +++$+++ I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
c05933 +++$+++ Yeah, Kay?
c05933 +++$+++ Did our friend announce when he's making his speech?
c05933 +++$+++ Noon exactly.
c05933 +++$+++ Did he say where?
c05933 +++$+++ Actually, yeah--
c05933 +++$+++ Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
c05933 +++$+++ Cause I think we're looking at it.
c04300 +++$+++ Thank you so much for accompanying me.
c04300 +++$+++ Not at all.
c04300 +++$+++ I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
c04300 +++$+++ You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
c01325 +++$+++ Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, because she was old back when he was young.
c01325 +++$+++ No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
c01325 +++$+++ Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
c24602 +++$+++ Dolores.
c24602 +++$+++ Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom and dad.  But I'll make sure you go last.
c24602 +++$+++ So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
c24323 +++$+++ ...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!
c24323 +++$+++ That was gas, Sweetie.
c24323 +++$+++ Jus some girlie things for the squad.
c16040 +++$+++ We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
c16040 +++$+++ Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
c16040 +++$+++ What?
c16040 +++$+++ What?
c21777 +++$+++ Yeah, what?
c21777 +++$+++ Rent.  You're late.
c21777 +++$+++ Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
c21777 +++$+++ Kit give me nothin'.
c21777 +++$+++ Of rent I do not bullshit.
c09029 +++$+++ Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
c09029 +++$+++ Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
c09029 +++$+++ Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
c20565 +++$+++ That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
c20565 +++$+++ Nick?
c20565 +++$+++ This has been a real confusing day.
c22524 +++$+++ You told a lie and got on a plane.
c22524 +++$+++ That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
c22524 +++$+++ Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
c22524 +++$+++ Becky?
c22524 +++$+++ What?
c22524 +++$+++ Is this crazy?
c22524 +++$+++ No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
c22524 +++$+++ Thank you.  I love you.
c22524 +++$+++ Good night.
c07916 +++$+++ We've progressed emotionally in --
c07916 +++$+++ Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
c07916 +++$+++ Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
c03418 +++$+++ I want to go home.
c03418 +++$+++ But could I just tell you this one thing?
c03418 +++$+++ What?
c03418 +++$+++ This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
c03418 +++$+++ No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
c07020 +++$+++ It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
c07020 +++$+++ Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
c07020 +++$+++ Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
c07020 +++$+++ Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
c07020 +++$+++ Did you win?
c07020 +++$+++ We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
c07020 +++$+++ Oh, Leon, you are so good to me.
c07020 +++$+++ We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
c07020 +++$+++ Those newspaper people?
c07020 +++$+++ You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
c07020 +++$+++ What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
c07020 +++$+++ Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
c07020 +++$+++ Oh, Leon!
c07020 +++$+++ Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
c07020 +++$+++ Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
c07020 +++$+++ Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
c22193 +++$+++ How ya feelin'?
c22193 +++$+++ ...Tight.
c22193 +++$+++ ...No.
c26414 +++$+++ When was the last time I wore pink?
c26414 +++$+++ The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
c26414 +++$+++ Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
c18486 +++$+++ Thea, what's wrong?
c18486 +++$+++ The General threatened me.
c18486 +++$+++ Oh, that Vrykolaka business. You mustn't be too angry with him, Thea. He's an old man and now with all this trouble ---- the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village.
c18486 +++$+++ He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
c18486 +++$+++ Well, tell, him.
c18486 +++$+++ I can't.
c18486 +++$+++ Why in the world can't you?
c18486 +++$+++ He hates all my race.
c18486 +++$+++ It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
c10666 +++$+++ Is that really it?
c10666 +++$+++ That's really it.
c10666 +++$+++ So I'm told.
c04079 +++$+++ This is against the rules.
c04079 +++$+++ So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
c04079 +++$+++ You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
c26515 +++$+++ I don't know about that.
c26515 +++$+++ I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
c26515 +++$+++ What lawyer?
c11068 +++$+++ I read George Jean Nathan every week.
c11068 +++$+++ Also Addison deWitt.
c11068 +++$+++ You didn't have to tell me.
c19762 +++$+++ Andy?
c19762 +++$+++ Hi George!
c19762 +++$+++ Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony Clifton... is he performing anywhere?
c19762 +++$+++ That's alright.  Where...?
c21285 +++$+++ I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
c21285 +++$+++ Why are you mad?
c21285 +++$+++ Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
c21285 +++$+++ I don't know.
c08187 +++$+++ The Professor might have everyone else fooled, but I know who the real brains of the operation is.
c08187 +++$+++ You do.
c08187 +++$+++ That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
c08187 +++$+++ Of course. So sexy.
c22666 +++$+++ I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
c22666 +++$+++ Say what, Cap'n?
c22666 +++$+++ You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
c22666 +++$+++ Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
c22666 +++$+++ To each, his own.
c03307 +++$+++ You like him, don't you?
c03307 +++$+++ Oh yes. But it takes time.
c03307 +++$+++ Since his beard was red.
c16359 +++$+++ How have you been?
c16359 +++$+++ ... You know me?
c16359 +++$+++ Is this a test, sir?
c16359 +++$+++ Yes... it's a test.
c16359 +++$+++ You were in here last Thursday night.
c16359 +++$+++ What?
c16359 +++$+++ You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
c16359 +++$+++ Is this part of the test?
c15699 +++$+++ I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
c15699 +++$+++ Are you planning to be the exception?
c15699 +++$+++ Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
c15699 +++$+++ And you've forgotten yours.
c15699 +++$+++ I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
c27133 +++$+++ How long?
c27133 +++$+++ She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
c27133 +++$+++ Ray thinks she was murdered.
c04346 +++$+++ It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
c04346 +++$+++ That's right, Miss Packard.
c04346 +++$+++ She's a smart girl, Eddie.
c13180 +++$+++ I don't know a recent Saturday I've sold more.  You didn't think I'd sell that health restaurant, did you?
c13180 +++$+++ No.  Not even you.
c13180 +++$+++ Why so glum?
c13180 +++$+++ I don't know.
c13180 +++$+++ Go ahead.
c13180 +++$+++ No, nothing.  I've got a problem, I guess.
c13180 +++$+++ No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
c03786 +++$+++ Hi kid.  Would you look what the car dragged in.
c03786 +++$+++ I'm glad you brought your vacuum cleaner.
c03786 +++$+++ That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
c20037 +++$+++ Yeah?
c20037 +++$+++ Jose Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
c20037 +++$+++ Where's the new drop point...?
c20037 +++$+++ They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
c20037 +++$+++ What do you think?
c20037 +++$+++ It's a rip and a hit.
c20037 +++$+++ You can't.
c19494 +++$+++ Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
c19494 +++$+++ I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
c19494 +++$+++ What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
c19494 +++$+++ She understands.
c19494 +++$+++ He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers."  Man, how stupid am I.
c19494 +++$+++ I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...
c08310 +++$+++ Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
c08310 +++$+++ Do you have to say that?
c08310 +++$+++ What?
c08310 +++$+++ You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
c08310 +++$+++ I say it because it's descriptive.
c08310 +++$+++ Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
c08310 +++$+++ Ann, you always underestimate me.
c08310 +++$+++ Well, I wonder why.
c08310 +++$+++ I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
c08310 +++$+++ Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
c08310 +++$+++ "My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
c08310 +++$+++ I have a pretty good idea.
c08310 +++$+++ Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
c08310 +++$+++ He doesn't have a phone.
c08310 +++$+++ Well, I'll call him when he does.
c08310 +++$+++ But he won't.
c08310 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c08310 +++$+++ He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
c08310 +++$+++ Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
c08310 +++$+++ Let me talk to him first.
c08310 +++$+++ Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
c08310 +++$+++ I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
c08310 +++$+++ And... do whatever it is you do.
c01801 +++$+++ It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
c01801 +++$+++ Yes...
c01801 +++$+++ That's not what happened to your parents.
c01801 +++$+++ I killed them.
c04702 +++$+++ Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
c04702 +++$+++ May I come in?
c04702 +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
c04702 +++$+++ I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
c04702 +++$+++ On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
c07384 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c07384 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c07384 +++$+++ Why?
c07384 +++$+++ I was trying not to tell you...
c07384 +++$+++ I'm dizzy and thirsty.
c18308 +++$+++ I wish I hadn't heard --
c18308 +++$+++ Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
c18308 +++$+++ That doesn't sound like him.
c18308 +++$+++ That's right -- he's playing the noble husband for you, isn't he? That won't last long.
c18308 +++$+++ One of these days he'll start on you, the way he did on her.  "You think life's beautiful, don't you, Jessica?  You think you're beautiful, don't you, Jessica?"  What he could do to that word "beautiful." That's Paul's great weapon -- words.  He uses them the way other men use their fists.
c25033 +++$+++ You knew this man didn't die at the bomb site before we got here.
c25033 +++$+++ I'd been told as much.
c25033 +++$+++ You're saying the bombing was a cover-up. Of what?
c25033 +++$+++ I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
c25033 +++$+++ We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
c15226 +++$+++ It's supposed to be even hotter today.
c15226 +++$+++ You gonna open up another Sal's Famous Pizzeria?
c15226 +++$+++ No.  What are you gonna do?
c15226 +++$+++ Make dat money.  Get paid.
c15226 +++$+++ Yeah!...I'm goin' to the beach for the first day in fifteen years. Gonna take the day off and go to the beach.
c15226 +++$+++ I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
c15226 +++$+++ Mookie?
c15226 +++$+++ C'mere, Doctor.
c22360 +++$+++ I didn't know you were coming.
c22360 +++$+++ I was in the neighborhood.
c22360 +++$+++ Yeah.
c01034 +++$+++ Seventy-five hundred.
c01034 +++$+++ Not interested.
c01034 +++$+++ Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
c01034 +++$+++ I'm marrying Debbie.
c01034 +++$+++ What is this person's story here?
c06079 +++$+++ The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
c06079 +++$+++ So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
c06079 +++$+++ Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
c26132 +++$+++ See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
c26132 +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
c26132 +++$+++ Right.  She's only fourteen.
c17687 +++$+++ It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
c17687 +++$+++ Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
c17687 +++$+++ Look, I'm just as much at fault.
c17687 +++$+++ I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
c25967 +++$+++ I appreciate you coming in so early.
c25967 +++$+++ Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
c25967 +++$+++ Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
c20671 +++$+++ You're not eating.
c20671 +++$+++ I never eat when I'm serene.
c20671 +++$+++ I switched that around when you weren't looking.
c16004 +++$+++ You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
c16004 +++$+++ Fuck him.
c16004 +++$+++ This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
c16004 +++$+++ Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.
c16497 +++$+++ Cerveza.
c16497 +++$+++ Serveza yourself!
c16497 +++$+++ No, dammit, I would easy.
c25565 +++$+++ Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
c25565 +++$+++ No, Mr. Charles.
c25565 +++$+++ How did you get in here?
c25565 +++$+++ I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
c25565 +++$+++ You worked here?
c25565 +++$+++ Yes, sir.  Julia Wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
c25565 +++$+++ Well, that's a hot one.  You a bookkeeper!  When were you ever a bookkeeper?
c25565 +++$+++ That time you sent me up last ... I learned book-keeping at Sing Sing.  I figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
c25565 +++$+++ Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
c25565 +++$+++ Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
c25565 +++$+++ Trying to put it off on her?
c25565 +++$+++ Mr. Charles - she did - that's why he got sore at her and killed her. Listen, Mr. Charles --  I did do a little chiseling.  I come to bring it back and fix up the books.  I didn't want him to find out and come after me -
c25565 +++$+++ Police!
c04264 +++$+++ Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
c04264 +++$+++ Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
c04264 +++$+++ Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
c04264 +++$+++ Tasted pretty good.
c13315 +++$+++ I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
c13315 +++$+++ What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
c13315 +++$+++ That's my job too.
c00680 +++$+++ How are we feeling tonight?
c00680 +++$+++ No.
c00680 +++$+++ No what?
c00680 +++$+++ No!
c00680 +++$+++ Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
c00680 +++$+++ I thought not.
c04275 +++$+++ That was good babe, just keep doing that.
c04275 +++$+++ That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
c04275 +++$+++ Help, help us.
c07064 +++$+++ But O'Brien doesn't even use that office.  The Democrats've moved to Miami.  There's nothing there!
c07064 +++$+++ It was just a fishing expedition. Apparently it was their fourth attempt at the DNC.
c07064 +++$+++ Their fourth!
c07064 +++$+++ Contributions!  It was a legal contribution.  Who the hell authorized this?  Colson?
c03029 +++$+++ Go on... I want to hear everything.
c03029 +++$+++ Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
c03029 +++$+++ It is.
c13365 +++$+++ Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
c13365 +++$+++ Yeah, sure I do. Why?
c13365 +++$+++ Well...
c22062 +++$+++ And... ?
c22062 +++$+++ What and?  That's what I got.
c22062 +++$+++ A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
c22062 +++$+++ Am I supposed to take this information and sit up in the hills with a frickin' telescope?
c01531 +++$+++ I thought I was here to meet women.
c01531 +++$+++ Not that one!
c01531 +++$+++ And don't be so obvious!
c07713 +++$+++ This is funny.
c07713 +++$+++ Yeah.
c07713 +++$+++ I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
c07713 +++$+++ Ok.
c07713 +++$+++ Alright?
c07713 +++$+++ ....Hi.....
c10551 +++$+++ The families... want your ticket. Turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  Everybody goes home.
c10551 +++$+++ ... Absolutely not.
c10551 +++$+++ I am accountable.
c05805 +++$+++ I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
c05805 +++$+++ Okay...
c05805 +++$+++ Okay.
c22218 +++$+++ Maroon?  Whaddaya want?
c22218 +++$+++ Have you got the will?
c22218 +++$+++ Maybe.  Why?
c22218 +++$+++ Stop what?
c00357 +++$+++ How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
c00357 +++$+++ What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
c00357 +++$+++ Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
c03367 +++$+++ Can I help you?
c03367 +++$+++ I'm Walter Peck.  I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, Third District.
c03367 +++$+++ Great!  How's it going?
c03367 +++$+++ Yes, I'm Doctor Venkman.
c22870 +++$+++ Yes.
c22870 +++$+++ Who is this?
c22870 +++$+++ Who are you trying to reach?
c22870 +++$+++ What number is this?
c22870 +++$+++ What number are you trying to reach?
c22870 +++$+++ I don't know.
c22870 +++$+++ I think you have the wrong number.
c22870 +++$+++ It happens. Take it easy.
c23329 +++$+++ I don't think so.  What about skydiving? A crank call to Billy Graham?
c23329 +++$+++ You have evidenced great maturity, Mary Robert.  We shall have a serious discussion.
c23329 +++$+++ What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
c23329 +++$+++ Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
c23329 +++$+++ Don't push it.
c02769 +++$+++ Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
c02769 +++$+++ I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
c02769 +++$+++ Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
c02769 +++$+++ Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
c02769 +++$+++ What?
c02769 +++$+++ You're not the quiet type, Frances.
c18755 +++$+++ It's my fault.
c18755 +++$+++ What --
c18755 +++$+++ It's not fair to you.  This whole --
c18755 +++$+++ Tell me -- let me help --
c18755 +++$+++ I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
c18755 +++$+++ Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
c18755 +++$+++ I don't need you to "stick."
c18755 +++$+++ You want...
c18755 +++$+++ ...my soul or something. _ 117.
c25420 +++$+++ I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
c25420 +++$+++ You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
c25420 +++$+++ Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
c25420 +++$+++ I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
c25420 +++$+++ Why didn't you come to me?
c25420 +++$+++ I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
c25420 +++$+++ I'm not, but Majorek is.
c25420 +++$+++ Please, don't insult us.  Can you do something for him?
c10828 +++$+++ Patrizia, I'm afraid.
c10828 +++$+++ More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
c10828 +++$+++ But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
c01348 +++$+++ He wants a lot of money.
c01348 +++$+++ I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
c01348 +++$+++ He wants the money from your bank.
c01348 +++$+++ I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
c01348 +++$+++ I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
c09572 +++$+++ Hello.
c09572 +++$+++ You looking for some action?
c09572 +++$+++ All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
c14784 +++$+++ You look different. I mean you look good.
c14784 +++$+++ You never say that.
c14784 +++$+++ No.
c06460 +++$+++ Even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
c06460 +++$+++ They do what I tell 'em.
c06460 +++$+++ You and me both. Sal-va-to-re.
c25691 +++$+++ I hope you find the figures correct.
c25691 +++$+++ I hope so, too.
c25691 +++$+++ M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
c25691 +++$+++ And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
c02265 +++$+++ I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
c02265 +++$+++ You mean soap?
c02265 +++$+++ Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
c02265 +++$+++ Wonder where we'll be then.
c02265 +++$+++ Until it withers away.
c27193 +++$+++ You gotta promise to feed her.
c27193 +++$+++ I will.
c27193 +++$+++ Absolutely!
c07835 +++$+++ The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
c07835 +++$+++ This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
c07835 +++$+++ She was . . . innocent
c22454 +++$+++ I would like one of my people to help.
c22454 +++$+++ Ambassador, let me assure you that the FBI has made this a top priority. We have plenty of manpower on the case.
c22454 +++$+++ As I said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
c20871 +++$+++ The first fun's bound to be rough. It that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. But if the EEG flatlines, don't touch anything.
c20871 +++$+++ Won't that mean you're dead?
c20871 +++$+++ Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
c20871 +++$+++ Dixie McCoy didn't.
c20871 +++$+++ Okay fine. Let's get this over with.
c07530 +++$+++ When did you...?
c07530 +++$+++ Been out for six months now.
c07530 +++$+++ You know, this and that.
c14812 +++$+++ No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
c14812 +++$+++ You got a dog?
c14812 +++$+++ How big?
c13721 +++$+++ I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
c13721 +++$+++ Reggie -- listen to me --
c13721 +++$+++ Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
c13721 +++$+++ So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
c13721 +++$+++ I'm not fifteen.
c13721 +++$+++ Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
c13721 +++$+++ Why can't you be serious?
c13721 +++$+++ There, you said it.
c13721 +++$+++ Said what?
c13721 +++$+++ Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
c01447 +++$+++ Can't make you change your mind?
c01447 +++$+++ Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
c01447 +++$+++ Might be different in New York.
c01447 +++$+++ I'd like that.
c25974 +++$+++ Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people.  Only Carl knows who they are.  That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't know Ruiz.  Church and State.
c25974 +++$+++ What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
c25974 +++$+++ Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
c24337 +++$+++ It must be about that appalling script of hers.  What can I say to her? What can I say?
c24337 +++$+++ I can tell her you're all tied up in the projection room.  I can give her the brush ...
c24337 +++$+++ Listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. Isn't that enough?
c24337 +++$+++ I didn't mean to --
c24337 +++$+++ Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
c24337 +++$+++ She got to be.  A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit.  Hold everything.
c04995 +++$+++ You're right, that was Ordell. You have time, you think you could find out for me where he's staying?
c04995 +++$+++ Cops can't locate him, huh?
c04995 +++$+++ They don't have your winning personality.
c04995 +++$+++ I think I do. Is that good enough?
c08911 +++$+++ Enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
c08911 +++$+++ And we are gaining... Stand by, tractor beam!
c08911 +++$+++ If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
c06443 +++$+++ Meyer.
c06443 +++$+++ It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
c06443 +++$+++ Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
c06443 +++$+++ No. We ain't even...
c06443 +++$+++ Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
c06443 +++$+++ Whatta ya mean? It's great!
c15150 +++$+++ Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you a shot down the hospital or what?
c15150 +++$+++ Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal!
c15150 +++$+++ Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
c15150 +++$+++ Oh no!
c15150 +++$+++ He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
c15150 +++$+++ I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
c15150 +++$+++ If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
c15150 +++$+++ He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me.
c15150 +++$+++ You try calling the police?
c15150 +++$+++ What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
c15150 +++$+++ Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
c15150 +++$+++ He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
c15150 +++$+++ He's makin' threats in there.
c15150 +++$+++ He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
c15150 +++$+++ What kind of things, Leon?
c15150 +++$+++ Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was ... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already.
c15150 +++$+++ He needed money?  For the operation for you?
c15150 +++$+++ It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
c15150 +++$+++ Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
c15150 +++$+++ I can't talk to him.
c15150 +++$+++ You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
c15150 +++$+++ I'm afraid.
c15150 +++$+++ How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
c15150 +++$+++ You think it over, Leon.
c02080 +++$+++ Who says you have to know the King to be in a hole? I actually did have a real job once. When I was in high school, I worked as a candy striper.
c02080 +++$+++ Sounds respectable.
c02080 +++$+++ You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
c01513 +++$+++ I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!
c01513 +++$+++ Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
c01513 +++$+++ I can't, it's yours.
c01513 +++$+++ Okay.
c19674 +++$+++ Yeah?
c19674 +++$+++ Where are you?
c19674 +++$+++ We're by Ozone...
c19674 +++$+++ You set to go -
c19674 +++$+++ Alright, stay on the phone.
c23609 +++$+++ Good evening, sir.
c23609 +++$+++ I come to the old lady's funeral.
c23609 +++$+++ I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
c23609 +++$+++ That's because I've been on the wagon.
c23609 +++$+++ PLEASE!
c23609 +++$+++ Show the gentleman to the chapel - pew number three.
c19618 +++$+++ Linda --
c19618 +++$+++ What are you doing?
c19618 +++$+++ I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
c19618 +++$+++ Hang up the phone.
c19618 +++$+++ PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
c20690 +++$+++ Yes.
c20690 +++$+++ Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
c20690 +++$+++ She's fine.
c20690 +++$+++ Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks.
c21271 +++$+++ You don't seem all that scared.
c21271 +++$+++ Of course I am.
c21271 +++$+++ You don't act like it.
c21271 +++$+++ What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
c21271 +++$+++ Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
c21271 +++$+++ You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
c21271 +++$+++ It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
c21271 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c21271 +++$+++ Sure.
c14283 +++$+++ Did you see the van back there?
c14283 +++$+++ What van?
c14283 +++$+++ Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
c14283 +++$+++ Where'd you get your subscribers?
c14283 +++$+++ I put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
c14283 +++$+++ Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
c14283 +++$+++ You haven't been bothering them, have you?
c14283 +++$+++ They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
c14283 +++$+++ Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
c14283 +++$+++ I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
c14283 +++$+++ Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
c14283 +++$+++ Henry Finch.  That they monitor everything.  That it was only a matter of time.  And now four people are dead.
c13802 +++$+++ If you don't want to go with me just say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an excuse. I'm so sick of it.
c13802 +++$+++ I'm not using him as an excuse.
c13802 +++$+++ Yes you are. You always do. It's why we broke up. You always hide behind him.
c13802 +++$+++ I do not.
c13802 +++$+++ I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
c13802 +++$+++ I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
c13802 +++$+++ They're not picking me up until six.
c13802 +++$+++ Yes!
c18118 +++$+++ I will see what I can do.
c18118 +++$+++ I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
c18118 +++$+++ I wish I were like you. Look at my staff, they won't work, they listen to no one.
c05772 +++$+++ Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
c05772 +++$+++ But what is this -- why?
c05772 +++$+++ Muscle? I don't know that one.
c12421 +++$+++ Nobody..no sir..that's right..nobody's going be doing that..nobody going be writing my daughter's characteristics on the animal side..no sir..I don't care..ain't laying that down..no sir. I refuse..that's right..that's right...
c12421 +++$+++ Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
c12421 +++$+++ But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
c05415 +++$+++ ...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
c05415 +++$+++ Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
c05415 +++$+++ You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
c05415 +++$+++ A little...
c05415 +++$+++ Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
c17217 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
c17217 +++$+++ "The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
c17217 +++$+++ Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
c04741 +++$+++ If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself--long ago.
c04741 +++$+++ Do you love her?
c04741 +++$+++ A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
c04741 +++$+++ Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
c26820 +++$+++ New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission.  <u>No</u> mention of the Girlscout. None.
c26820 +++$+++ Eight Days To Go
c26820 +++$+++ I <u>live</u> for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off.  Watcha got for me?
c26820 +++$+++ Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?
c26820 +++$+++ We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
c26820 +++$+++ Anything at the Airport?
c26820 +++$+++ Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
c26820 +++$+++ <u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...?
c26820 +++$+++ Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
c26820 +++$+++ An <u>Albanian</u>, a young Albanian Girl.
c26820 +++$+++ A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...
c07785 +++$+++ If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
c07785 +++$+++ There's something else I want from you.
c07785 +++$+++ You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
c07785 +++$+++ I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....
c11248 +++$+++ Psychic awareness. Right.
c11248 +++$+++ You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
c11248 +++$+++ What?
c11248 +++$+++ Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
c03629 +++$+++ If I should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. That's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
c03629 +++$+++ A future. The only future I've got.
c03629 +++$+++ That money wouldn't last forever. And then what? You'd be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you've got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you're settled, I could maybe help out sometimes...
c03629 +++$+++ Just trying to help, Lilly.
c18020 +++$+++ I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
c18020 +++$+++ And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
c18020 +++$+++ How?
c09058 +++$+++ ... and because they have warp capabilities, the consequences to their society are minimal...
c09058 +++$+++ You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
c09058 +++$+++ In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
c09058 +++$+++ I'll need all your paperwork tomorrow. We're heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.
c09058 +++$+++ Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
c14508 +++$+++ What are you doing?
c14508 +++$+++ Can you loan me a 20?
c14508 +++$+++ Sure. Why?
c14508 +++$+++ I think you're overreacting.
c17807 +++$+++ No.
c17807 +++$+++ Every suicide kills two.
c17807 +++$+++ Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
c17807 +++$+++ You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
c17807 +++$+++ Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
c17807 +++$+++ Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
c17807 +++$+++ What would you guess, Ardelia?
c17807 +++$+++ You goin to shoot yourself?
c17807 +++$+++ Don't shoot yourself.
c17807 +++$+++ Cause I'm tired, cleaning up after you.  Why dontcha gimme the gun?
c04930 +++$+++ I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
c04930 +++$+++ Do you think they bought it?
c04930 +++$+++ Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
c04930 +++$+++ All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
c03466 +++$+++ Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
c03466 +++$+++ Yes.
c03466 +++$+++ I'm very neurotic.
c16029 +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
c16029 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
c16029 +++$+++ It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
c12132 +++$+++ Mr...?
c12132 +++$+++ Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
c12132 +++$+++ Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
c05887 +++$+++ Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.
c05887 +++$+++ Oh, George . . .
c05887 +++$+++ Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
c05887 +++$+++ George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
c05887 +++$+++ I'd go mad!
c05887 +++$+++ Well, I can't think of anything more to say. Goodbye, Bob.
c14085 +++$+++ I can't fucking believe you!!
c14085 +++$+++ I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
c14085 +++$+++ You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
c14085 +++$+++ I was just leaning on it! It was an accident!
c14085 +++$+++ Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
c14085 +++$+++ So the casket fell over! Big deal!
c14085 +++$+++ Her fucking body fell out!
c14085 +++$+++ Just... go! Go open the video store.
c13862 +++$+++ You're the only one I can trust.
c13862 +++$+++ The only one who understands what this me-...
c13862 +++$+++ Doctor.
c09033 +++$+++ Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
c09033 +++$+++ Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
c09033 +++$+++ Mr. Sulu, if you please.
c20836 +++$+++ The corporate plundering of Yeshoto Industries... At first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
c20836 +++$+++ What does this have to do with me?
c20836 +++$+++ Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
c20836 +++$+++ Sense/Net's corporately financed. Too corrupt to be trusted. You of all people should know that.
c26870 +++$+++ ....beautiful.
c26870 +++$+++ Of course, we're gonna need some <u>water</u>, uh...
c26870 +++$+++ Is it a <u>stream</u>, or is it a...
c26870 +++$+++ No, I think..
c26870 +++$+++ No, I think it's ... can we see the calico <u>kitten</u>...?
c14597 +++$+++ Jade Fox?  Impossible.
c14597 +++$+++ You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
c14597 +++$+++ I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
c14597 +++$+++ Is there any place safer than under the nose of Governor Yu?
c14597 +++$+++ So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
c14597 +++$+++ Did you see who posted it?
c11407 +++$+++ It's an unfair advantage.
c11407 +++$+++ You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
c11407 +++$+++ Okay, knock it off.
c11407 +++$+++ Truce?
c11407 +++$+++ Truce.
c11407 +++$+++ I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake.
c09112 +++$+++ I was nervous -
c09112 +++$+++ You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
c09112 +++$+++ The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
c17409 +++$+++ House 25. Number's on the door.
c17409 +++$+++ Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
c17409 +++$+++ Two and a half cents.
c17409 +++$+++ Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
c17409 +++$+++ Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
c17409 +++$+++ But--but how we gonna eat?
c17409 +++$+++ Which way is House 25?
c18025 +++$+++ Yes.  How did you know?
c18025 +++$+++ A lucky guess.
c18025 +++$+++ I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
c18025 +++$+++ He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
c18025 +++$+++ Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
c18025 +++$+++ You got me.
c18025 +++$+++ Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
c18025 +++$+++ Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
c18025 +++$+++ If it's good advice.
c18025 +++$+++ Why?  What's going on?
c10414 +++$+++ She getting good care over there?
c10414 +++$+++ Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I...
c10414 +++$+++ Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least? You know what CODE BLUE means?
c10414 +++$+++ It's a common medical term.
c15993 +++$+++ Honey ...
c15993 +++$+++ You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
c15993 +++$+++ Honey ...
c15993 +++$+++ Frank.
c07907 +++$+++ Jefferies.
c07907 +++$+++ Congratulations, Jeff.
c07907 +++$+++ For what?
c07907 +++$+++ Who said I was getting rid of it?
c01267 +++$+++ The exercise was one of his Section Eight "private sessions". Left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.
c01267 +++$+++ And the problem is you only got three.
c01267 +++$+++ No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
c01267 +++$+++ Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
c02827 +++$+++ Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
c02827 +++$+++ There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
c02827 +++$+++ What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
c02827 +++$+++ You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
c00148 +++$+++ This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
c00148 +++$+++ Your doctor?
c00148 +++$+++ Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
c00148 +++$+++ ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
c00148 +++$+++ It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
c00148 +++$+++ You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
c00148 +++$+++ Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
c00148 +++$+++ Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
c00148 +++$+++ Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
c00148 +++$+++ And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
c00148 +++$+++ We're in negotiations, that's correct.
c00148 +++$+++ That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
c05456 +++$+++ Hello, Mr. Parker.
c05456 +++$+++ Hello.
c05456 +++$+++ How are you feeling?
c05456 +++$+++ Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
c05456 +++$+++ He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
c05456 +++$+++ I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
c13566 +++$+++ I'm still okay.
c13566 +++$+++ Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
c13566 +++$+++ He wants 75 back.
c13566 +++$+++ Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
c13566 +++$+++ Let me talk to him.  Hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
c19966 +++$+++ ...It's not over, 'til it's over.
c19966 +++$+++ Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
c19966 +++$+++ I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
c19966 +++$+++ I'm going to stick it out here.  We still have a shot.
c11639 +++$+++ Ben Corbett?
c11639 +++$+++ Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
c11639 +++$+++ No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
c18607 +++$+++ No, we'll go through here.
c18607 +++$+++ ... Mean through the tubes?
c18607 +++$+++ Yes.  It's faster.
c18607 +++$+++ No,  I'm not going through there.
c18607 +++$+++ Michael, come on, don't be silly. This is the quickest way.  You're not going to walk all the way around?
c18607 +++$+++ I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
c18607 +++$+++ They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
c18607 +++$+++ Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!
c11962 +++$+++ ...I just don't know what... to do-
c11962 +++$+++ You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on - just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
c11962 +++$+++ Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you - well I do. Now don't argue with me.
c09408 +++$+++ What was the part?
c09408 +++$+++ Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
c09408 +++$+++ "Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
c09408 +++$+++ Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
c09408 +++$+++ Yes!
c26214 +++$+++ I've seen him.
c26214 +++$+++ Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
c26214 +++$+++ What are you talkin' about?
c26214 +++$+++ I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks.
c26214 +++$+++ I don't believe you.
c26214 +++$+++ That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
c26214 +++$+++ On their honeymoon.
c26214 +++$+++ They didn't tell me.
c08565 +++$+++ Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
c08565 +++$+++ It's fantastic -- it's too much.
c08565 +++$+++ It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
c08565 +++$+++ It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
c04076 +++$+++ That stuff'll put you away if you're not careful.
c04076 +++$+++ There was a Count.  Count Dusan.  He would invite the local peasants to his chateau, fill them full of wine, then slice their bellies so he could reuse it.  The symmetry of that somehow always appealed to me.
c04076 +++$+++ You're very macabre.
c04076 +++$+++ It's my birthday.
c04076 +++$+++ Thanks.
c02575 +++$+++ You have something, Dr. Weir?
c02575 +++$+++ The date.
c02575 +++$+++ What about it?
c02575 +++$+++ The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
c02575 +++$+++ Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
c17158 +++$+++ I just left our friend in Miami.
c17158 +++$+++ How is his health?
c17158 +++$+++ Not good.
c17158 +++$+++ He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect.
c18931 +++$+++ Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
c18931 +++$+++ No, I'm look --
c18931 +++$+++ If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
c18931 +++$+++ Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
c01363 +++$+++ So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
c01363 +++$+++ Sometimes.
c01363 +++$+++ Sometimes which?
c01363 +++$+++ Sometimes neither.
c01363 +++$+++ Some... What does that mean?
c01363 +++$+++ There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
c01363 +++$+++ I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
c01363 +++$+++ Why?
c01363 +++$+++ Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
c01363 +++$+++ So now you hate all women?
c01363 +++$+++ Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
c24753 +++$+++ You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
c24753 +++$+++ Why?
c24753 +++$+++ I didn't build the fucking thing.
c24753 +++$+++ Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
c24753 +++$+++ Of course.
c20464 +++$+++ Mulholland Drive.
c20464 +++$+++ Mulholland Drive?
c20464 +++$+++ That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
c20464 +++$+++ Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
c20464 +++$+++ We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
c21435 +++$+++ You survived your first gay party intact.
c21435 +++$+++ Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
c21435 +++$+++ Let's review these notes for your testimony. We have a big day on Monday.
c03114 +++$+++ Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
c03114 +++$+++ 'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
c03114 +++$+++ Ask your man here.
c08146 +++$+++ Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
c08146 +++$+++ Don't ask me because I won't tell you! I won't tell anybody! Go away!
c08146 +++$+++ Don't act so -- crazy.
c08146 +++$+++ That's a good girl.
c17046 +++$+++ Roma!  I'm talking to you...
c17046 +++$+++ I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
c17046 +++$+++ Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do, my fr...It's not me that ripped the joint off, I'm doing business. I'll be with you in a while.  You got it...?  Where are you going?
c03407 +++$+++ I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
c03407 +++$+++ Let him trust Quintus.
c03407 +++$+++ Quintus is overly idealistic.
c03407 +++$+++ I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
c03407 +++$+++ Me?  Well, I believe in Rome... you'd have to after what I've seen, how people outside the empire treat each other.
c03407 +++$+++ What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
c25322 +++$+++ He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
c25322 +++$+++ How's the boy doing?
c25322 +++$+++ Good. You needn't worry about the Austrian anymore. He's dead. I'll be in touch.
c26012 +++$+++ My work keeps me young.
c26012 +++$+++ Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
c26012 +++$+++ The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
c26012 +++$+++ Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
c26012 +++$+++ We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
c26012 +++$+++ Noriega is a criminal.
c26012 +++$+++ Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, I don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.
c26012 +++$+++ Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.
c26012 +++$+++ If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
c01388 +++$+++ And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
c01388 +++$+++ Now wait...
c01388 +++$+++ I know about how she was like. But we was different. I's the only person she talked to about it. How she's abused. Terrible things, Gill, just terrible...
c22104 +++$+++ Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
c22104 +++$+++ I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
c22104 +++$+++ It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
c04622 +++$+++ Oh, Bill... Main Justice is investigating a major New York bank. Laundering narco dollars out of their Mexico City branch. You want it for the Evening News?
c04622 +++$+++ What about you, you got a crew already?
c04622 +++$+++ I'm gonna do a follow-up.
c04622 +++$+++ Catch ya' later.
c27352 +++$+++ If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
c27352 +++$+++ Yorgi asked me to.
c27352 +++$+++ You do everything Yorgi says?
c27352 +++$+++ Go to hell.
c27352 +++$+++ It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that?
c27352 +++$+++ Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you.
c19101 +++$+++ Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
c19101 +++$+++ It's to make you <u>understand</u> him, with understanding comes tolerance. Too bad they don't put proverbs in Twinkies, my load would be lighter.
c19101 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c01379 +++$+++ I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
c01379 +++$+++ You didn't have to do this.
c01379 +++$+++ Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
c03704 +++$+++ Excuse me.
c03704 +++$+++ One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
c03704 +++$+++ Huh.
c03704 +++$+++ He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
c03704 +++$+++ He's a kind of gladiator who fights with a knife and a net and doesn't wear anything but a jockstrap.
c03704 +++$+++ How do you know that?
c03704 +++$+++ You told me.
c03704 +++$+++ When?
c03704 +++$+++ When we were up in the tree so long--with the bats.
c03704 +++$+++ Oh.  I'd forgotten.
c03704 +++$+++ Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
c03704 +++$+++ Really?
c03704 +++$+++ Sorry.
c20397 +++$+++ The look on their faces when one walks into the room.  Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
c20397 +++$+++ I wouldn't know.
c20397 +++$+++ Surely --
c20397 +++$+++ What I do, I do for my Queen.
c20397 +++$+++ Was there never ambition?
c20397 +++$+++ Maybe, once.
c20397 +++$+++ Then I envy yo.
c20397 +++$+++ Why?
c20397 +++$+++ To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
c20397 +++$+++ I do what I do.
c20397 +++$+++ For Her Majesty.
c20397 +++$+++ Aye.
c20397 +++$+++ But yourself?  What about John Brown?
c20397 +++$+++ No other aspiration?
c13670 +++$+++ What the fuck am I doing here.
c13670 +++$+++ What the fuck were you doing here?
c13670 +++$+++ I got sent.
c13670 +++$+++ You could have said no.
c13670 +++$+++ Can't. Once I signed up.
c13670 +++$+++ Why did you sign up?
c13670 +++$+++ It was a job. So I get sent to the only place in the world they call you nigger to your face.
c13670 +++$+++ Shouldn't take it personally.
c13670 +++$+++ "Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
c13670 +++$+++ And you play cricket?.
c13670 +++$+++ Best game in the world.
c13670 +++$+++ Ever see hurling?
c13670 +++$+++ That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
c13670 +++$+++ Best game in the world.
c13670 +++$+++ The fastest.
c00637 +++$+++ Mozart -
c00637 +++$+++ Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
c00637 +++$+++ Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
c00637 +++$+++ Because they do. They go on forever - at least what they represent. The eternal in us, not the ephemeral. Opera is here to ennoble us. You and me, just as much as His Majesty.
c10971 +++$+++ Computer, this is Captain Standard. What conditions are you talking about?
c10971 +++$+++ I have intercepted a transmission of unknown origin.
c10971 +++$+++ A voice transmission.
c02070 +++$+++ Minus one.
c02070 +++$+++ You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
c02070 +++$+++ I guess it lacks a certain style.
c02070 +++$+++ Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
c02070 +++$+++ You can't cheat an honest man.
c02070 +++$+++ I apologize for the inconvenience.
c01851 +++$+++ When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
c01851 +++$+++ How do you know this?
c01851 +++$+++ Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
c01851 +++$+++ Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.
c17756 +++$+++ Well.  Word gets around.
c17756 +++$+++ ...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
c17756 +++$+++ It wasn't my day.
c17756 +++$+++ Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
c17756 +++$+++ It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
c17756 +++$+++ Or, perhaps...
c17756 +++$+++ ...how are things at the Hospital?
c17756 +++$+++ It's a growth business.
c17756 +++$+++ What have they got you doing?
c17756 +++$+++ Orderly.
c17756 +++$+++ I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
c17756 +++$+++ I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
c17756 +++$+++ You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
c17756 +++$+++ Yes, I presumed it was about him.
c17756 +++$+++ ...you...
c17756 +++$+++ I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
c17756 +++$+++ I'm looking for...
c17756 +++$+++ He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
c17756 +++$+++ He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
c25689 +++$+++ You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
c25689 +++$+++ But please, Baron. We're not supposed to breathe a word of it. You won't tell anybody I told you?
c25689 +++$+++ Yes, Baron. Thank you.
c20179 +++$+++ Not much luggage.
c20179 +++$+++ I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
c20179 +++$+++ How grateful?
c20179 +++$+++ Well that depends.
c20179 +++$+++ On what.
c20179 +++$+++ How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
c20179 +++$+++ How I usually find you, Nyah.
c20179 +++$+++ How do you that.
c20179 +++$+++ Ahh..
c02157 +++$+++ Hello, bomb, are you with me?
c02157 +++$+++ Of course.
c02157 +++$+++ Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
c02157 +++$+++ Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?
c03739 +++$+++ He's a child!
c03739 +++$+++ With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
c03739 +++$+++ You're begging him to kill you?
c03739 +++$+++ If he thinks he's man enough.
c03739 +++$+++ That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
c03739 +++$+++ I'm teaching my son to be a man.
c03739 +++$+++ So he can kill you.  You hate your own life that much.  You beg for a hero to kill you.
c03739 +++$+++ I plan to live one hundred years!
c03739 +++$+++ No you don't.
c03739 +++$+++ If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
c03739 +++$+++ Honor, I suppose.
c03739 +++$+++ What a handsome word.
c03739 +++$+++ But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
c03739 +++$+++ If you've lived a good life, fought well--
c03739 +++$+++ May I continue with the rearing of my son?  Load that gun!
c20855 +++$+++ I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
c20855 +++$+++ No problem, amigo.
c20855 +++$+++ What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
c20855 +++$+++ Those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  Tell you what, Bro. I'll make you a deal. I help you nail this A.I., you gotta do me one favour.
c20855 +++$+++ When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
c07755 +++$+++ Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
c07755 +++$+++ Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
c07755 +++$+++ It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
c04054 +++$+++ I called Dan Koretzky because he --
c04054 +++$+++ Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?
c04054 +++$+++ Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
c04054 +++$+++ WHAT?
c04054 +++$+++ Just local, of course.
c04054 +++$+++ And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
c04054 +++$+++ I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
c04054 +++$+++ You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
c04054 +++$+++ What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
c04054 +++$+++ That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
c04054 +++$+++ Barry said its done.
c04054 +++$+++ Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
c19459 +++$+++ I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
c19459 +++$+++ I don't remember that.
c19459 +++$+++ I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
c19459 +++$+++ What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
c17212 +++$+++ I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here."  I was wondering which here you meant.
c17212 +++$+++ I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps.
c17212 +++$+++ But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
c17212 +++$+++ You're planning a trip?
c12069 +++$+++ You don't seem like the type who does business with Mr. Shreck.
c12069 +++$+++ No.  And you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
c12069 +++$+++ Well that's a ... long story ...
c12069 +++$+++ Well, I could ... free up some time...
c12069 +++$+++ I'm tempted.
c11973 +++$+++ Take care, you hear?
c11973 +++$+++ Did you find out about her parents?
c11973 +++$+++ You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
c12507 +++$+++ Recognize him?
c12507 +++$+++ From the surveillance footage in the bloodbank.  He was one of the guard's Nomak attacked.
c12507 +++$+++ Which means he turned about seventy-two hours ago.
c12507 +++$+++ Time.
c26098 +++$+++ My dinner.
c26098 +++$+++ I was wondering where you got that glow of good health.
c26098 +++$+++ Uh... got any cinnamon?
c18918 +++$+++ Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
c18918 +++$+++ Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
c18918 +++$+++ Uh uh.
c18918 +++$+++ Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
c03053 +++$+++ Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you!  They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you!  Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
c03053 +++$+++ I'm very aware of that.
c03053 +++$+++ I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
c03053 +++$+++ Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say?  If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory.
c18314 +++$+++ I suppose so.  Yes.
c18314 +++$+++ And charming?
c18314 +++$+++ Don't.  It will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great  unhappiness.
c15598 +++$+++ I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
c15598 +++$+++ Oh my God.
c15598 +++$+++ Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
c15598 +++$+++ With what?
c15598 +++$+++ With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
c15598 +++$+++ Anytime.
c00462 +++$+++ Forget it.  I was reading.
c00462 +++$+++ I was reading too.
c00462 +++$+++ What's the story?
c00462 +++$+++ I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
c06477 +++$+++ Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
c06477 +++$+++ How much?
c06477 +++$+++ Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could probably get <u>People</u> and <u>Entertainment Tonight</u> to cover it.
c06477 +++$+++ And last...you remember Bill here, from the Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something I think you'll like.
c10679 +++$+++ This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
c10679 +++$+++ Kinship.
c10679 +++$+++ Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
c15468 +++$+++ Yo --
c15468 +++$+++ pierdo.
c15468 +++$+++ Tu
c15468 +++$+++ pierdes.
c15468 +++$+++ pierde.
c08014 +++$+++ I guess I just don't understand anything.
c08014 +++$+++ I'm tired, Judy.  I'd like to change the subject.
c08014 +++$+++ Why?
c08014 +++$+++ Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
c13625 +++$+++ Don't.
c13625 +++$+++ Sorry.
c13625 +++$+++ I should have known, shouldn't I?
c13625 +++$+++ Probably.
c13625 +++$+++ Kind of wish I didn't.
c13625 +++$+++ You can always pretend.
c13625 +++$+++ That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
c13625 +++$+++ Absolutely.
c13625 +++$+++ Won't be quite the same though, will it?
c13625 +++$+++ I'm working on it.
c08328 +++$+++ It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
c08328 +++$+++ What's so stupid about it?
c08328 +++$+++ That you... you don't even know the guy.
c08328 +++$+++ Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
c08328 +++$+++ Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
c08328 +++$+++ I like the way he dresses.
c08328 +++$+++ What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
c08328 +++$+++ "The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
c08328 +++$+++ Jesus Christ. And he doesn't have sex with any of them? They just talk?
c08328 +++$+++ Right.
c08328 +++$+++ Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
c08328 +++$+++ Interact, fine, but did you have to masturbate in front of him, for God's sake? I mean...
c23174 +++$+++ Hi, George.
c23174 +++$+++ Hey, baby, what's happening?
c23174 +++$+++ Great, great. I hope you make it.
c16578 +++$+++ Are you all right, Doctor?
c16578 +++$+++ Where am I?
c16578 +++$+++ You're in the Records Room.
c16578 +++$+++ I'm fine.
c16578 +++$+++ Can I get you something?
c16578 +++$+++ Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
c16578 +++$+++ Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
c16578 +++$+++ Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
c16578 +++$+++ It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
c16104 +++$+++ Ivory.
c16104 +++$+++ Looks old.
c16104 +++$+++ Wow.
c23107 +++$+++ What do you do?
c23107 +++$+++ Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
c23107 +++$+++ What's it about?
c23107 +++$+++ A priest who dies.
c23107 +++$+++ I see.
c23107 +++$+++ Yeah. Well, maybe I'll change it.
c23107 +++$+++ No.
c23107 +++$+++ Yes, I mean, who wants to read about another dead priest? It's about some other guy, some guy who's not a priest, who doesn't die. You see, it's better already.
c23107 +++$+++ It's a breeze.
c18748 +++$+++ I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
c18748 +++$+++ You think so?
c18748 +++$+++ Oh tsht. Yes.
c18748 +++$+++ -- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --
c02551 +++$+++ If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
c02551 +++$+++ Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
c02551 +++$+++ Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
c11478 +++$+++ Did you see that?  How he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  I'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
c11478 +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
c11478 +++$+++ Yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
c07448 +++$+++ We don't have to go to war to gain independence...
c07448 +++$+++ Balderdash!
c07448 +++$+++ There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
c07448 +++$+++ Name five hundred.
c07448 +++$+++ Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
c07448 +++$+++ That's five, keep going...
c07448 +++$+++ You said bribery twice...
c11101 +++$+++ Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.
c11101 +++$+++ You've what?
c11101 +++$+++ The heave-ho.
c08945 +++$+++ My Lord... what are your orders?
c08945 +++$+++ I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
c08945 +++$+++ Sir, may I --
c08945 +++$+++ Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
c08945 +++$+++ We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
c08945 +++$+++ They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
c08945 +++$+++ Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
c04167 +++$+++ And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
c04167 +++$+++ What for?
c04167 +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry.
c13876 +++$+++ ...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
c13876 +++$+++ Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
c13876 +++$+++ 'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
c13876 +++$+++ His girlfriend?
c13876 +++$+++ Yes, his girlfriend.
c13876 +++$+++ You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
c13876 +++$+++ Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
c13876 +++$+++ Yeah.
c13876 +++$+++ Doesn't that strike you as odd?
c13876 +++$+++ No. She's probably scared to death.
c13876 +++$+++ Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
c13876 +++$+++ Maybe.
c13876 +++$+++ If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
c13876 +++$+++ You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
c13876 +++$+++ When was the last time?
c15311 +++$+++ Listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and I've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- JESSICA Calm yourself/
c15311 +++$+++ The spice!  It's in everything here.  The air, the soil, the food...  It's like the Truthsayer drug.....  It's a poison!!!! You knew the spice would change me.  But thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  I can see it... I can see it.
c15311 +++$+++ Is he....?
c15311 +++$+++ You carry my unborn sister in your womb!
c15311 +++$+++ You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood... I'm not your Kwisatz Haderach...  I'm something different, something unexpected!  I'm a seed.  I am so much more...  You don't begin to know me...
c26325 +++$+++ I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
c26325 +++$+++ Wh . . . what are you talking about?
c26325 +++$+++ This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
c26325 +++$+++ Come on, Jake--
c26325 +++$+++ Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
c26325 +++$+++ Nothing happened with me and Grace this morning.
c26325 +++$+++ Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
c26325 +++$+++ Christ, Jake, please--
c26325 +++$+++ Is that what happened?  Did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
c26325 +++$+++ You're not talking sense.
c26325 +++$+++ Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
c26325 +++$+++ What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
c26325 +++$+++ A drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  Just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  Only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  A man's got to protect his home.  His wife.  You're dead, boy, and your own mother wouldn't convict me.
c26325 +++$+++ What difference does it make if I slept with her.  You don't care about Grace.
c26325 +++$+++ You're right.  I don't give a damn about her.  But to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  That just makes a fool out of him.  I don't like being made a fool of.
c26325 +++$+++ I don't blame you.  What man would? I admit it, okay?  I came back here and I made it with Grace.  But if you kill me you're making a big mistake.
c26325 +++$+++ Not from where I stand.
c26325 +++$+++ It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
c26325 +++$+++ Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
c06225 +++$+++ You come up here often?
c06225 +++$+++ I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
c06225 +++$+++ Yeah.
c06225 +++$+++ Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
c06225 +++$+++ I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
c06225 +++$+++ This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
c06225 +++$+++ Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
c06225 +++$+++ I'm having a very good time, too.
c06225 +++$+++ So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
c06225 +++$+++ I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
c15747 +++$+++ Lose something?
c15747 +++$+++ I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
c15747 +++$+++ And--
c15747 +++$+++ Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
c20391 +++$+++ Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
c20391 +++$+++ How will I know?
c20391 +++$+++ I'm sorry?
c20391 +++$+++ How will I know what she requires?
c20391 +++$+++ You'll be sent a message.
c20391 +++$+++ Who'll bring it to me?
c20391 +++$+++ Her Highness' Equerry.
c20391 +++$+++ I need a man who knows where I am.
c20391 +++$+++ That's not good enough.
c14368 +++$+++ Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
c14368 +++$+++ No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
c14368 +++$+++ We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
c15067 +++$+++ Howdy, Jabez.
c15067 +++$+++ Howdy, Hank.
c15067 +++$+++ Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
c15067 +++$+++ Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
c15067 +++$+++ Well -- here's how it is ...Tom Sharp, Eli Higgins and a couple of others been talking to me about -- that new sort of organization -- grange they call it. What you think about it?
c15067 +++$+++ I don't know -- don't seem much of an idea to me.
c15067 +++$+++ Yes, but what does a farmer do if he don't want to get roped in some more by them loan sharks?
c15067 +++$+++ Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
c15067 +++$+++ Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
c15067 +++$+++ Thanks, Jabez -- I really wouldn't need very much ... if you could let me have some seed to start off with enough for spring planting ...
c15632 +++$+++ Hey!
c15632 +++$+++ Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't <u>ever</u> mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
c15632 +++$+++ I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
c15632 +++$+++ You're Brill.
c22563 +++$+++ Listen to this --
c22563 +++$+++ Not now, Jonah --
c22563 +++$+++ Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
c22563 +++$+++ WAIT!!!  -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore."  Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
c20740 +++$+++ What kind of pies do you have?
c20740 +++$+++ Apple, pecan, cherry, and key lime.
c20740 +++$+++ Which do you recommend?
c20740 +++$+++ The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
c20740 +++$+++ I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
c20740 +++$+++ No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk.
c14902 +++$+++ I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
c14902 +++$+++ Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
c14902 +++$+++ But...we bury the heads. Oh. God! It must be torture for them!
c14902 +++$+++ They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
c14902 +++$+++ The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
c22441 +++$+++ Jesus...what do you want?
c22441 +++$+++ This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
c22441 +++$+++ Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
c07908 +++$+++ This is Wednesday.
c07908 +++$+++ Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
c07908 +++$+++ Wrong day?
c07908 +++$+++ Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
c07908 +++$+++ Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
c25547 +++$+++ Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
c25547 +++$+++ Yes.
c25547 +++$+++ Good. I want to talk to you.
c25547 +++$+++ That's jolly.
c25547 +++$+++ Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
c25547 +++$+++ Can't you get to sleep?
c25547 +++$+++ No.
c25547 +++$+++ Maybe a drink would help you.
c25547 +++$+++ Maybe it would if I took it.
c15144 +++$+++ Sonny, I'm gettin' real bad vibes.
c15144 +++$+++ Jackie - what are you talking about?
c15144 +++$+++ It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
c10200 +++$+++ You weren't gonna say goodbye?
c10200 +++$+++ I was, later.
c10200 +++$+++ Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
c10200 +++$+++ I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
c10200 +++$+++ I know exactly what you mean.
c10200 +++$+++ How could you?
c10200 +++$+++ ...Something like that.
c09392 +++$+++ You live in such a fantasy world...
c09392 +++$+++ What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
c09392 +++$+++ ...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
c13040 +++$+++ What's the matter?
c13040 +++$+++ Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
c13040 +++$+++ You are late.
c13040 +++$+++ Even later.
c13040 +++$+++ Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
c13040 +++$+++ Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
c13040 +++$+++ Really? - God, how time flies!
c11541 +++$+++ What's gotten into you, Baxter?
c11541 +++$+++ Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
c11541 +++$+++ Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
c25832 +++$+++ Age quod agis.
c25832 +++$+++ Credat Judaeus Apella.
c25832 +++$+++ In pace requiescat.
c08037 +++$+++ I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
c08037 +++$+++ Nick, what are you talking about?
c08037 +++$+++ Part of... with them?
c15586 +++$+++ Sorry.
c15586 +++$+++ You don't get it. They go through your phone records. They fuckin' monitor everyone you called in the last--
c15586 +++$+++ Oh, I'll bet <u>that</u> threw 'em off the scent. I sure hope you covered the mouthpiece with a handkerchief and used a funny voice!
c16367 +++$+++ One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
c16367 +++$+++ No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
c16367 +++$+++ Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
c23978 +++$+++ Hello.
c23978 +++$+++ I thought you had Play Practice.
c23978 +++$+++ Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
c23978 +++$+++ That's for sure.
c00170 +++$+++ And your charming little daughter?
c00170 +++$+++ Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
c00170 +++$+++ Oh, that's such a delightful age.
c00170 +++$+++ How is gregor?
c00170 +++$+++ Well, where are all of you off to?
c18162 +++$+++ We'd've been splitsville years ago, with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but Steven doesn't "believe" in divorce.
c18162 +++$+++ Not too big on it myself -- but then again, not on marriage either.
c18162 +++$+++ Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
c18162 +++$+++ No need for divorce and that messy division-of-assets thing when they kick before you do.
c14728 +++$+++ Who are you?
c14728 +++$+++ You called me by my name.
c14728 +++$+++ Irena. But who are you?
c14728 +++$+++ I'm your friend.
c14728 +++$+++ I've wanted a friend.
c14728 +++$+++ I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
c14728 +++$+++ But where do you come from?
c14728 +++$+++ You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
c14728 +++$+++ But where is that?
c14728 +++$+++ I can not tell you.
c14728 +++$+++ Will you be friend for always?
c14728 +++$+++ For as long as you'll let me.
c14728 +++$+++ I shall want you for always.
c14728 +++$+++ For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
c14728 +++$+++ Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
c14728 +++$+++ Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
c14979 +++$+++ Yes, Albert?
c14979 +++$+++ John,we're going huntin'.
c14979 +++$+++ Who's going?
c14979 +++$+++ We're all going.
c14979 +++$+++ Nick's going?
c14979 +++$+++ No women?
c19878 +++$+++ I haven't been the father to you that --
c19878 +++$+++ That you've been to Susan?
c19878 +++$+++ But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
c19871 +++$+++ Did you speak to the Governor?
c19871 +++$+++ He's coming.
c19871 +++$+++ Unfortunately.  I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
c21490 +++$+++ Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
c21490 +++$+++ Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
c21490 +++$+++ What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
c21490 +++$+++ Thanks for the tip, Johns.
c20307 +++$+++ So.
c20307 +++$+++ Where is she?
c20307 +++$+++ Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
c20307 +++$+++ Yes.
c13612 +++$+++ He was different.
c13612 +++$+++ How different?
c13612 +++$+++ As different as it's possible to be.
c13612 +++$+++ Tell me about him.
c13612 +++$+++ No.
c13612 +++$+++ Yes.
c23791 +++$+++ Do you talk with your mom?
c23791 +++$+++ It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
c23791 +++$+++ My mom told me not to stay in this town.
c23791 +++$+++ So why do you stay?
c23791 +++$+++ I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
c23791 +++$+++ I bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers.
c23791 +++$+++ Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
c23791 +++$+++ I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
c23791 +++$+++ How much would you charge me for the lips?
c23791 +++$+++ More than you could afford.
c23791 +++$+++ Come on, bargain with me.
c23791 +++$+++ I could let them go for ten.
c23791 +++$+++ If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
c06029 +++$+++ You like the ponies?
c06029 +++$+++ Sure. Yeah.
c06029 +++$+++ You bet the ponies?
c06029 +++$+++ Me? No. Not really.
c06029 +++$+++ Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
c06029 +++$+++ Why?
c06029 +++$+++ It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
c06029 +++$+++ This one?
c06029 +++$+++ Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
c06029 +++$+++ Pshhh...
c06029 +++$+++ A million. Easy.
c06029 +++$+++ She was fast, huh?
c06029 +++$+++ That's why they call it the smart money.
c06558 +++$+++ The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
c06558 +++$+++ You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
c06558 +++$+++ Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
c06558 +++$+++ Convene?
c06558 +++$+++ Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
c06558 +++$+++ With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
c06558 +++$+++ Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
c06558 +++$+++ No. What had you better--?
c06558 +++$+++ Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
c03917 +++$+++ Do you believe in hell?
c03917 +++$+++ There is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. From there it infects our dreams. Our thoughts. Grigory gave us a glance tonight --
c03917 +++$+++ Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
c03917 +++$+++ Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
c03917 +++$+++ C'mon -- Rasputin??
c03917 +++$+++ That makes him more than a hundred --
c03990 +++$+++ Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
c03990 +++$+++ Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
c03990 +++$+++ I see.
c03990 +++$+++ She's so damn... English.
c03990 +++$+++ Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
c00763 +++$+++ What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
c00763 +++$+++ Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
c00763 +++$+++ They must have turned him down.
c00763 +++$+++ Sure, they'd turn him down. He ought to know that. I'm going in there and talk to him.
c21658 +++$+++ Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.
c21658 +++$+++ And you're at this third stage
c21658 +++$+++ No, there's a fourth.  Numbness. You do everything right, but you feel nothing either way.
c21658 +++$+++ I think you're exaggerating.  And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
c21658 +++$+++ Yes.  You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it.  You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness.  That's what I think anyway.
c01961 +++$+++ It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
c01961 +++$+++ My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
c01961 +++$+++ And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
c01961 +++$+++ Our expenses?
c01961 +++$+++ Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
c18460 +++$+++ No, no, no. This was really sweet...
c18460 +++$+++ I scared you -- I crossed the line --
c18460 +++$+++ No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
c18460 +++$+++ Are you sure? I really appreciate it.
c15657 +++$+++ How much did you pay?
c15657 +++$+++ Hello!  Good morning.
c15657 +++$+++ They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
c15657 +++$+++ Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
c15657 +++$+++ Which stall?
c15657 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c15657 +++$+++ You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
c15657 +++$+++ I don't want to go back.
c15657 +++$+++ This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
c15657 +++$+++ I don't care to bargain.
c15657 +++$+++ That insults them.
c15657 +++$+++ I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
c15657 +++$+++ Excuse me.
c23738 +++$+++ He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
c23738 +++$+++ I'm about to blow the wall.
c23738 +++$+++ How does the distress signal look?
c26949 +++$+++ Love.
c26949 +++$+++ What?
c26949 +++$+++ Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
c26949 +++$+++ I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
c16790 +++$+++ What murders?
c16790 +++$+++ Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
c16790 +++$+++ There's nothing to worry about, Suzy. The guy's dead now, somewhere at the bottom of this lake...if you believe the stories.  Let's drop it, okay?
c01643 +++$+++ I don't want to cause any trouble.
c01643 +++$+++ I'm here, aren't I?
c01643 +++$+++ Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
c07157 +++$+++ What'd you give for that thing?
c07157 +++$+++ You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
c07157 +++$+++ I need to know that.
c07157 +++$+++ You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
c07157 +++$+++ Big talk.
c07157 +++$+++ Just keep it up.
c07157 +++$+++ That'll work.
c12862 +++$+++ I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
c12862 +++$+++ I feel so embarrassed.
c12862 +++$+++ Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
c12862 +++$+++ You have no reason to feel ashamed. You haven't said anything you don't have a right to. And if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me.
c26530 +++$+++ Mr. Abraham...
c26530 +++$+++ Abrams...
c26530 +++$+++ Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
c26530 +++$+++ I'm fine.
c26530 +++$+++ Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
c26530 +++$+++ Ah.  How did they treat you?
c03579 +++$+++ Madam has slept well?
c03579 +++$+++ Oh, yes, Suzette.
c03579 +++$+++ Madam will dress now, it is late.
c03579 +++$+++ Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it.
c07622 +++$+++ Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
c07622 +++$+++ Well, sir, I putter.
c07622 +++$+++ Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
c07622 +++$+++ I just putter.
c07622 +++$+++ Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
c07622 +++$+++ Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
c07622 +++$+++ Well sir, I'll show you.
c22440 +++$+++ You got a lot of guts calling me.
c22440 +++$+++ Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
c22440 +++$+++ Listen, this ain't about us! It's about a thirteen year old girl. She's not gonna make it. Unless we do something.
c16037 +++$+++ That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
c16037 +++$+++ The tenth's out.
c16037 +++$+++ What?
c16037 +++$+++ I can't make the tenth.
c16037 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c16037 +++$+++ I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
c16037 +++$+++ I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
c08153 +++$+++ How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
c08153 +++$+++ Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
c08153 +++$+++ We don't want to go there.
c08153 +++$+++ No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
c08153 +++$+++ Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
c08153 +++$+++ What are you waiting for? Do something.
c24336 +++$+++ Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
c24336 +++$+++ More proof God's a guy...
c24336 +++$+++ Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
c08496 +++$+++ This a friend of yours?
c08496 +++$+++ He is now.
c08496 +++$+++ Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
c12385 +++$+++ It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
c12385 +++$+++ I'm sure you're not going crazy.
c12385 +++$+++ Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
c12385 +++$+++ Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
c12385 +++$+++ Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
c12385 +++$+++ You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
c12385 +++$+++ I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
c12385 +++$+++ Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
c12385 +++$+++ I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
c12385 +++$+++ You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
c12385 +++$+++ I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
c12385 +++$+++ All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
c12385 +++$+++ The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.
c09277 +++$+++ You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
c09277 +++$+++ I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
c09277 +++$+++ It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
c11645 +++$+++ Told you I'm fine!
c11645 +++$+++ How many do you see?
c11645 +++$+++ What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
c11645 +++$+++ It's a spring day...
c07011 +++$+++ Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
c07011 +++$+++ You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
c07011 +++$+++ Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
c07011 +++$+++ What, darling?
c07011 +++$+++ Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
c08865 +++$+++ Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
c08865 +++$+++ So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
c08865 +++$+++ This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
c01676 +++$+++ Know what we need, man?... some rope.
c01676 +++$+++ For what?
c01676 +++$+++ Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
c01676 +++$+++ What?
c01676 +++$+++ Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
c01676 +++$+++ Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
c01676 +++$+++ I'm serious.
c01676 +++$+++ Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
c01676 +++$+++ What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
c02680 +++$+++ I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
c02680 +++$+++ Do you want to come inside?
c02680 +++$+++ Aren't your parents asleep?
c02680 +++$+++ Okay. Sure. I'll come in.
c25306 +++$+++ Am I supposed to know him?
c25306 +++$+++ Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
c25306 +++$+++ Clients come and go.
c25306 +++$+++ Huh, I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
c07462 +++$+++ God, that's fine.
c07462 +++$+++ Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
c07462 +++$+++ What were you listening to?
c07462 +++$+++ Allman Brothers.
c07462 +++$+++ The Eat A Peach album. God, they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them. Listen to this, Louis.
c22316 +++$+++ I don't know...
c22316 +++$+++ You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
c22316 +++$+++ Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
c22316 +++$+++ I...I can't do that.
c22316 +++$+++ Okay then.  I'll do it.
c22316 +++$+++ Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
c11398 +++$+++ Go.
c11398 +++$+++ Hey!  Would you?
c11398 +++$+++ It was fifteen seconds.
c11398 +++$+++ Are you always this much fun?
c17729 +++$+++ Sometimes she's terrific...
c17729 +++$+++ Oooo.
c17729 +++$+++ ...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
c17729 +++$+++ ...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...
c25182 +++$+++ Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?
c25182 +++$+++ No.
c25182 +++$+++ He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "I'm going to beat you".
c25182 +++$+++ Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?
c07899 +++$+++ This is the baby sitter.
c07899 +++$+++ Oh. When are they expected home?
c07899 +++$+++ I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
c07899 +++$+++ Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
c07899 +++$+++ Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
c07899 +++$+++ Goodnight.
c23406 +++$+++ I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
c23406 +++$+++ You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
c23406 +++$+++ Well, I hate him.
c23406 +++$+++ He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
c23406 +++$+++ Will you stay here with us for a long time?
c23406 +++$+++ I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
c23406 +++$+++ I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
c23406 +++$+++ I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
c23406 +++$+++ I like the way you talk.
c04051 +++$+++ Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
c04051 +++$+++ Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
c04051 +++$+++ Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
c04051 +++$+++ Oh, great...
c04381 +++$+++ What's the limit?
c04381 +++$+++ Half and a dollar.
c04381 +++$+++ Ten dollars.
c21742 +++$+++ I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
c21742 +++$+++ Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
c21742 +++$+++ Please.
c21661 +++$+++ Why not stay?
c21661 +++$+++ I have to be up early.
c21661 +++$+++ Me too.
c21661 +++$+++ Too late.  Just my luck.
c18385 +++$+++ I could say the same thing about you.
c18385 +++$+++ Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
c18385 +++$+++ The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
c08003 +++$+++ Why don't we just rent it for the season?
c08003 +++$+++ You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
c08003 +++$+++ There's just one thing.  What about--
c05356 +++$+++ The other night -- I said some things that maybe I shouldn't have.  I mean, you haven't known me very long and I can see how you thought what you did.
c05356 +++$+++ I'm not looking for an apology, Peter.
c05356 +++$+++ I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
c05356 +++$+++ You really haven't seen my best side.
c09877 +++$+++ My God... I saw this.
c09877 +++$+++ It frightens you.
c09877 +++$+++ It was meant to.
c14286 +++$+++ I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
c14286 +++$+++ Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
c14286 +++$+++ I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
c14286 +++$+++ I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
c14286 +++$+++ Oh, Christ, here it comes.  Look, I know you think I'm crazy.  I don't think I am, but...
c14286 +++$+++ Jerry, I --
c14286 +++$+++ What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
c14286 +++$+++ If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
c14286 +++$+++ Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
c13864 +++$+++ Dr.  Long!
c13864 +++$+++ I got eight thousand yards. Radius is five...
c13864 +++$+++ What?
c07464 +++$+++ Jud, this is crazy. It's going to be almost dark before we get back.
c07464 +++$+++ It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
c07464 +++$+++ But--
c07464 +++$+++ Does she love the cat?
c07464 +++$+++ Then come on.
c06425 +++$+++ In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
c06425 +++$+++ The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
c06425 +++$+++ Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
c09270 +++$+++ Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
c09270 +++$+++ Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
c09270 +++$+++ Faith, can I talk to you a second?
c23845 +++$+++ What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
c23845 +++$+++ Fixing it.
c23845 +++$+++ Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
c23845 +++$+++ The refridgerator.
c23845 +++$+++ The refridgerator.
c23845 +++$+++ It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any.
c23845 +++$+++ That wasn't in there before.
c23845 +++$+++ We must've had it delivered then.
c23845 +++$+++ Wait a second --
c23845 +++$+++ 1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
c23845 +++$+++ None of this was here before.
c23845 +++$+++ Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
c23845 +++$+++ No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
c23845 +++$+++ You think?
c23845 +++$+++ You don't believe me.
c23845 +++$+++ All I know is I opened that refridgerator --
c23845 +++$+++ Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
c23845 +++$+++ This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
c23845 +++$+++ You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
c23845 +++$+++ Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me?
c26038 +++$+++ No, actually I went to Craignewton but I was worried that you wouldn't have heard of it so I put the Royal Edinburgh College instead, because they're both schools, right, and we're all in this together, and I wanted to put across the general idea rather than the details, yeah? People get all hung up on details, but what's the point? Like which school? Does it matter? Why? When? Where? Or how many O grades did I get? Could be six, could be one, but that's not important. What's important is that I am, right? That I am.
c26038 +++$+++ Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
c26038 +++$+++ Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
c26038 +++$+++ Hey. Right. No problem. Whatever you say, man. You're the man, the governor, the dude in the chair, like. I'm merely here. But obviously I am. Here, that is. I hope I'm not talking too much. I don't usually. I think it's all important though, isn't it?
c12881 +++$+++ You're somewhere else, where?
c12881 +++$+++ Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
c12881 +++$+++ You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
c25887 +++$+++ Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
c25887 +++$+++ - And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
c25887 +++$+++ Have we met?
c25887 +++$+++ Sidney Winch.
c10158 +++$+++ Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
c10158 +++$+++ Crow Horse, listen --
c10158 +++$+++ Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
c10158 +++$+++ Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
c10158 +++$+++ You got Jimmy. Let her go.
c10158 +++$+++ Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
c10158 +++$+++ No. So we can do what the old man said. Red Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.
c01296 +++$+++ Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
c01296 +++$+++ The fuck are you talking about --
c01296 +++$+++ You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
c01296 +++$+++ Bullshit --
c01296 +++$+++ Shut up!
c13252 +++$+++ What'd you dream about?
c13252 +++$+++ Nothing.
c13252 +++$+++ Nothing.  It was just a dream.
c09401 +++$+++ Cut that shit out.
c09401 +++$+++ She smiled baby.
c09401 +++$+++ That's not cool.
c09401 +++$+++ Did she, or did she not smile?
c09401 +++$+++ It doesn't matter...
c09401 +++$+++ I'm telling you, they love that shit.
c09401 +++$+++ You're gonna screw up our plan.
c09401 +++$+++ We're gonna get laid, baby.
c09401 +++$+++ First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
c09401 +++$+++ What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
c09401 +++$+++ Don't make fun, I think we can get some free shit if we don't fuck around.
c09401 +++$+++ Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun. Let's do it, baby.
c09401 +++$+++ Well, you look money, baby. We both look money.
c01627 +++$+++ Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
c01627 +++$+++ Those are my breasts.
c01627 +++$+++ If you want to.
c27343 +++$+++ You know what they say, the only way to change the system is from the inside.
c27343 +++$+++ Oh yeah? Why don't we start by taking this thing off my ankle? The poison needles?
c27343 +++$+++ On come on, X. Did you really think we were that barbaric?
c27343 +++$+++ No needles, huh? What about the acid bath?
c27343 +++$+++ You're a jerk-off, you know that?
c17696 +++$+++ Why should I be afraid?
c17696 +++$+++ Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
c17696 +++$+++ That thought doesn't terrify you?
c19346 +++$+++ They were jealous of him.
c19346 +++$+++ Why?  Because he had you?
c19346 +++$+++ You didn't marry him for love.
c17012 +++$+++ Shoes, boots, yes...
c17012 +++$+++ For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
c17012 +++$+++ For some sales pro...
c17012 +++$+++ ...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
c17012 +++$+++ Yes.
c17012 +++$+++ Yes, it is.  And you know who's responsible?
c17012 +++$+++ Who?
c17012 +++$+++ You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
c17012 +++$+++ No.
c17012 +++$+++ Yes.
c17439 +++$+++ Ma, they comes a time when a man gets mad.
c17439 +++$+++ Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
c17439 +++$+++ I know, Ma. I'm a tryin'. If it was the law they was workin' with, we could take it. But it *ain't* the law. They're workin' away at our spirits. They're tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl. They're workin' on our decency.
c17439 +++$+++ You promised, Tommy.
c17439 +++$+++ I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
c17439 +++$+++ What's that--detour?
c15897 +++$+++ Shut up, Plissken.
c15897 +++$+++ What's the little black box do?
c15897 +++$+++ Top secret. Only on a need to know.
c15897 +++$+++ And I don't need to know. So fuck you, I'm goin' to Hollywood.
c15897 +++$+++ That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
c15897 +++$+++ So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
c15897 +++$+++ Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
c01065 +++$+++ How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
c01065 +++$+++ Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
c01065 +++$+++ Mrs.?
c01065 +++$+++ Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
c06548 +++$+++ Yield *how*, sir?
c06548 +++$+++ Will he yield for a question?
c06548 +++$+++ Ah, now, that's better.
c06548 +++$+++ Will he *yield*?
c06548 +++$+++ For a *question*.
c06548 +++$+++ Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
c06548 +++$+++ It does!
c06548 +++$+++ Every *aspect* of this matter--the gentleman's attack on that section-- everything--was dealt with in the committee hearing--
c06548 +++$+++ Mr. President--
c06548 +++$+++ I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
c06548 +++$+++ The committee ruled otherwise! The gentleman stands guilty as charged. And I believe I speak for all the members when I say that no one cares to hear what a man of his condemned character has to say about *any* section of *any* legislation before this house!
c15779 +++$+++ Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
c15779 +++$+++ Which one?
c15779 +++$+++ Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
c23655 +++$+++ Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
c23655 +++$+++ That's right!
c23655 +++$+++ Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
c03780 +++$+++ Did you see him?
c03780 +++$+++ Yeah.
c03780 +++$+++ Is he all right?
c03780 +++$+++ Far as I know.
c03780 +++$+++ Is he coming home?
c03780 +++$+++ He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
c03780 +++$+++ The park!
c03780 +++$+++ It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
c03780 +++$+++ I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
c03780 +++$+++ You figure!
c03780 +++$+++ Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
c03780 +++$+++ A what?
c03780 +++$+++ For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
c03780 +++$+++ They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, "Happy Birthday, Somebody Else."
c12312 +++$+++ Do you agree with Ben, Mr. Gardiner? Are we finished? Or do you think we can stimulate growth through temporary incentives?
c12312 +++$+++ As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
c12312 +++$+++ ... In the garden?
c12312 +++$+++ ... Spring and summer...  Yes, I see... Fall and winter.  Yes, indeed...  Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
c00924 +++$+++ Is that my -- scenario?  Tell me.
c00924 +++$+++ They'd frame him.
c00924 +++$+++ They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
c04889 +++$+++ I'm glad you could find time to see me.  I flew down from Denver this morning on my private jet.
c04889 +++$+++ Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
c04889 +++$+++ We can use all the support we can get.  I think these might interest you.
c19529 +++$+++ What people?
c19529 +++$+++ You know, people.
c19529 +++$+++ Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
c19529 +++$+++ I'm also good enough to go pro.
c19529 +++$+++ You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
c19529 +++$+++ You came out early.
c19529 +++$+++ Okay...
c11985 +++$+++ How do you know all this stuff about me?
c11985 +++$+++ You know all about me.
c11985 +++$+++ You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
c21671 +++$+++ Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
c21671 +++$+++ Yes, finally.
c21671 +++$+++ Are you up to something?
c07561 +++$+++ We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
c07561 +++$+++ Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
c07561 +++$+++ Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
c07561 +++$+++ I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
c03833 +++$+++ Just do what I say. Don't ask.
c03833 +++$+++ What is going on?
c03833 +++$+++ I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
c03833 +++$+++ What plan?
c03833 +++$+++ You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
c03833 +++$+++ Tell them anything you want. Tell them I'm on a vacation, a business trip. Tell them I needed a rest. Tell them anything, just don't tell them...
c15894 +++$+++ I'm already dead.
c15894 +++$+++ I see your point. What's the favor?
c15894 +++$+++ Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
c15894 +++$+++ Say goodnight, Carjack.
c18479 +++$+++ I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.
c18479 +++$+++ Yes?
c18479 +++$+++ I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep --- I want to avoid it.
c18479 +++$+++ I don't understand you.
c18479 +++$+++ I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure --- quite sure.
c18479 +++$+++ If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
c18479 +++$+++ No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
c18479 +++$+++ You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
c18479 +++$+++ Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
c25103 +++$+++ You gotta tell your story to the police.
c25103 +++$+++ Police? Why police? Das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. No, no. It is all nonsense; it was an accident.
c25103 +++$+++ You don't know it was an accident. You only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
c25103 +++$+++ Suppose I take...
c01308 +++$+++ No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
c01308 +++$+++ Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
c01308 +++$+++ I'll offer you more than it's worth. And you know you won't have to move. Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
c17566 +++$+++ Who's that?
c17566 +++$+++ Curtis.
c17566 +++$+++ That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
c17633 +++$+++ You still spooked?
c17633 +++$+++ I wasn't spooked.
c17633 +++$+++ Lies.
c17633 +++$+++ I saw someone standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
c17633 +++$+++ Probably Mister Riddle.
c17633 +++$+++ He was watching me.
c17633 +++$+++ Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
c17633 +++$+++ That's probably all he can do.
c19954 +++$+++ I told you to shut up.
c19954 +++$+++ Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
c19954 +++$+++ He is --
c19954 +++$+++ -- An IRS man.
c25520 +++$+++ Well, what'd you think?
c25520 +++$+++ I think we're on the right track.
c25520 +++$+++ Who're you calling?
c25520 +++$+++ I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
c25520 +++$+++ Nunheim!
c18826 +++$+++ But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
c18826 +++$+++ But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
c18826 +++$+++ John, John.  John, you're still building onto that Flea Circus, that illusion.  And now you're adding onto it by what you're doing here.  That's the illusion.
c13221 +++$+++ Here you go, enjoy.
c13221 +++$+++ I hope this was made with egg whites!
c13221 +++$+++ It was.
c13221 +++$+++ What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
c13221 +++$+++ Hm.
c16193 +++$+++ Damn...damn...damn...
c16193 +++$+++ Hey, are you okay?
c16193 +++$+++ Is there anything I can do for you?
c04805 +++$+++ How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
c04805 +++$+++ Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
c04805 +++$+++ You bet we did.
c04805 +++$+++ It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
c04805 +++$+++ I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of it--the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging.
c06104 +++$+++ The dirty yellow rat bastard.
c06104 +++$+++ Don't push it. You way ahead. You back on top. That boy loves you, man.
c06104 +++$+++ He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
c18729 +++$+++ You're looking worried again, Helena?
c18729 +++$+++ No I'm not.
c18729 +++$+++ Alright, I'm worried about Christmas. I wish I hadn't told him I'd be back ..
c25600 +++$+++ Why do I have to stay down here?
c25600 +++$+++ Jesus, Jaeger.
c25600 +++$+++ Someone's got to send the gold up.  It can't get on the line by itself.
c25207 +++$+++ Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
c25207 +++$+++ I'm glad you stayed.  Thank you.
c25207 +++$+++ You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
c07583 +++$+++ It has been alleged - yes--
c07583 +++$+++ You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
c07583 +++$+++ No? Well, where were you when that happened?
c13557 +++$+++ Yes?  Yes?
c13557 +++$+++ Hi Lenore.  It's me.  I got you back.  Courtesy of Star 69.  Are you hurt?
c13557 +++$+++ They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
c13557 +++$+++ Lucky for them they didn't.
c13557 +++$+++ What did you do?
c13557 +++$+++ I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
c13557 +++$+++ God, if he doesn't come back --
c13557 +++$+++ They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be --
c24525 +++$+++ Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
c24525 +++$+++ What do you fear?
c24525 +++$+++ Destiny.
c18225 +++$+++ Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
c18225 +++$+++ Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
c18225 +++$+++ It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
c18225 +++$+++ What else came with it?  Anything still here?
c18225 +++$+++ Sure.  Just papers, photos.  Stuff nobody'd ever want.
c18225 +++$+++ Can we see?
c18225 +++$+++ You gonna buy?
c18225 +++$+++ Right at the back there.  Middle shelves.  Coupla folders.  Nice stuff. I'd do you a good price.
c16870 +++$+++ Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?
c16870 +++$+++ You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
c16870 +++$+++ I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.
c00431 +++$+++ I want to let the gas run out. I don't want the bastard driving drunk, and he's always drunk now. After, we'll hide the keys.
c00431 +++$+++ Anything new about the shooting? Twombley?
c00431 +++$+++ Want to know what I think happened?
c03574 +++$+++ Sorry, Preysing.
c03574 +++$+++ You've decided against the merger?
c03574 +++$+++ Yes --
c03574 +++$+++ Yes --
c11100 +++$+++ Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
c11100 +++$+++ It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
c11100 +++$+++ Ain't it the truth?
c11100 +++$+++ Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
c11100 +++$+++ Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
c11100 +++$+++ They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
c06803 +++$+++ Yes, sir?
c06803 +++$+++ A glass of champagne, please.
c06803 +++$+++ Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
c06803 +++$+++ Yes, I am.
c06803 +++$+++ I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
c06803 +++$+++ Oh -- where do you come from?
c06803 +++$+++ Bastia -- and you?
c06803 +++$+++ Have you been back recently?
c14391 +++$+++ Yes.  Without question.
c14391 +++$+++ Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
c14391 +++$+++ The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
c14391 +++$+++ Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
c14391 +++$+++ He was lying.
c14391 +++$+++ 'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
c14391 +++$+++ I thought he was lying.
c14391 +++$+++ Because people who are suffering from aural hallucinations hear voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee told me that Joan of Arc always appeared beside him on his left side and spoke softly in his left ear.
c25586 +++$+++ You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
c25586 +++$+++ What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
c25586 +++$+++ Invest it.
c25586 +++$+++ Oh, that's fun.
c25586 +++$+++ It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
c25586 +++$+++ You know, you sound just like a boy who's never--
c03487 +++$+++ Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
c03487 +++$+++ No.
c03487 +++$+++ What?
c03487 +++$+++ Well, wait a minute. You married him.
c24913 +++$+++ Look, I don't wanna waste your time so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind? *You* don't mind. So while I'm in town I'll be staying at the Hotel Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's OK though, I poked around. I'm having 'em hold it for me on account of I'll be back and forth. In addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. We'll talk about appeals if, as and when. For right now, has she confessed?
c24913 +++$+++ No. Of course not. She didn't do it.
c24913 +++$+++ Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
c24913 +++$+++ Good! Any questions give me a ring-- Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a message. You sure you don't want anything? No?
c00595 +++$+++ What a charming idea. May I see?
c00595 +++$+++ It's just a trifle, of course.
c00595 +++$+++ Majesty.
c27395 +++$+++ Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night?  The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children?  Take you all away?
c27395 +++$+++ It does indeed, Max.
c27395 +++$+++ I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
c15330 +++$+++ "Greetings.  I am the Count."
c15330 +++$+++ "Greetings.  I am Slick Slomopavitz, Seeker of Adventure." Audience laughs.  Applause.  "Say, that's a funny place to sleep."
c15330 +++$+++ "It is my home."
c15330 +++$+++ "Beg to differ.  This casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
c11729 +++$+++ No.
c11729 +++$+++ Why?
c11729 +++$+++ This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?
c25247 +++$+++ Tormented -- ? Why?
c25247 +++$+++ I couldn't rest --- I couldn't sleep. All I could see was Teresa Delgado's body -- broken --mangled. I saw it day and night.  It was waiting everywhere I turned.
c25247 +++$+++ I didn't want to kill, but I had to. I heard her in the cemetery - talking to the man in the auto --
c05820 +++$+++ Something wrong?
c05820 +++$+++ My... My head.
c05820 +++$+++ No, no. I want to go in.
c02308 +++$+++ What is wrong with you?
c02308 +++$+++ I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
c02308 +++$+++ You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
c02308 +++$+++ Really?
c02308 +++$+++ No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
c02308 +++$+++ Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
c00602 +++$+++ But, Majesty, this is just a frolic. It's a piece about love.
c00602 +++$+++ Ah, love again.
c00602 +++$+++ But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
c00602 +++$+++ I have no idea.
c00602 +++$+++ Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
c00602 +++$+++ Twenty, sire! How about twenty? Twenty minutes of continuous music. No recitatives.
c01477 +++$+++ Nerves of steel.
c01477 +++$+++ No rust?
c01477 +++$+++ I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
c01477 +++$+++ Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
c22436 +++$+++ Want some?
c22436 +++$+++ No, fish is a PM food.
c22436 +++$+++ Nobody in America eats fish in the AM. We're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
c19831 +++$+++ Neo!
c19831 +++$+++ What the hell just happened?
c19831 +++$+++ I can't!
c21076 +++$+++ Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
c21076 +++$+++ I'm sure you will.
c21076 +++$+++ Oh...
c04114 +++$+++ Please not be touching me, Conor.
c04114 +++$+++ I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
c04114 +++$+++ You're not talking sense, Mara!
c26808 +++$+++ ...how do we Explain That?  Hey?  Am I worried...?
c26808 +++$+++ ...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
c26808 +++$+++ <u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
c26808 +++$+++ How do we explain that?  Ah, well, you see, Wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  You see? His <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of Group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
c23350 +++$+++ Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
c23350 +++$+++ Have they nothing to fear presently?
c23350 +++$+++ Without disrespect, look around you.  We overflow.  As do our courts.
c23350 +++$+++ But, how many innocents rot here? And, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?
c19088 +++$+++ I'm gonna get ticks.  I know it. They're drawn to me.  I got a thing about ticks.
c19088 +++$+++ Ssssh!
c19088 +++$+++ I heard something.
c14721 +++$+++ Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
c14721 +++$+++ But wishes don't come true.
c14721 +++$+++ Certain wishes do.
c14721 +++$+++ But this is different.  Go on blow,
c04790 +++$+++ I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
c04790 +++$+++ know--but--
c04790 +++$+++ Here. Eat your head off.
c04790 +++$+++ I don't want it now.
c04790 +++$+++ Thought you were hungry!
c04790 +++$+++ was--but--
c04790 +++$+++ But what!
c04790 +++$+++ Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
c12504 +++$+++ Smokey Huh?
c12504 +++$+++ Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
c12504 +++$+++ Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.
c12504 +++$+++ Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.
c12504 +++$+++ This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
c23198 +++$+++ Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
c23198 +++$+++ Well, yeah.
c23198 +++$+++ She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
c23198 +++$+++ I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
c04471 +++$+++ This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  This Tablet is one of those "markers." It proves the Knight's story is true. But as you pointed out -- it's incomplete.  Now, the second "marker" is entombed with the Knight's dead brother. Our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of Venice, Italy.  As you can now see, Doctor Jones, we're about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. We're only one step away.
c04471 +++$+++ That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
c04471 +++$+++ You could be more right than you know.
c04471 +++$+++ Yes?
c04471 +++$+++ We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
c04471 +++$+++ We already have. Your father is the man who's disappeared.
c26436 +++$+++ You... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
c26436 +++$+++ I fined 'em instead.
c26436 +++$+++ For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
c26436 +++$+++ Like whores?
c04398 +++$+++ You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
c04398 +++$+++ You wanna drink?
c04398 +++$+++ What's it so hot in here for?
c00846 +++$+++ Patrick? Is that you?
c00846 +++$+++ No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
c00846 +++$+++ Commes des Garcon.
c27159 +++$+++ Where is she?
c27159 +++$+++ Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
c27159 +++$+++ I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
c27159 +++$+++ Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
c09108 +++$+++ Mr. President.
c09108 +++$+++ Admiral Donald...Bill...
c09108 +++$+++ At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
c03254 +++$+++ No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
c03254 +++$+++ Yeah right... If I'm so cool, why haven't I had a girlfriend in four years? I can't even remember the last time a girl talked to me.
c03254 +++$+++ I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
c03254 +++$+++ Oh, right...
c03254 +++$+++ No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
c03254 +++$+++ Good luck...
c03254 +++$+++ I'm totally serious!
c03254 +++$+++ Yeah, well...
c03254 +++$+++ I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
c03254 +++$+++ I appreciate the offer but you really don't --
c03254 +++$+++ Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
c08395 +++$+++ Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
c08395 +++$+++ She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
c08395 +++$+++ That's your problem, Miles.
c08395 +++$+++ As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
c08395 +++$+++ It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
c20395 +++$+++ What do you know about the Highlands?
c20395 +++$+++ I am a blank sheet.
c20395 +++$+++ Do you hunt?
c20395 +++$+++ Occasionally.
c20395 +++$+++ Dare say you can be taught.
c20395 +++$+++ If you hunt, you kill.
c19312 +++$+++ I thought you got through that pretty well.
c19312 +++$+++ They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
c19312 +++$+++ People liked him.
c19312 +++$+++ I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
c11599 +++$+++ The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
c11599 +++$+++ We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
c11599 +++$+++ 'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
c11599 +++$+++ Beats me -- the sun was too much for him, or the mud. Who knows ?
c06641 +++$+++ Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
c06641 +++$+++ Arthur wants to quit!
c06641 +++$+++ Arthur! Who's Arthur?
c06641 +++$+++ What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this stuff in the paper? How'd it get in there? What'd you do last night? Who were you talking to?
c20448 +++$+++ Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
c20448 +++$+++ Okay, I'm thinking.
c20448 +++$+++ No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
c20448 +++$+++ Look ... where's this going? What do you want me to do?
c20448 +++$+++ There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
c20448 +++$+++ One.
c20448 +++$+++ So let's just say I'm drivin' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me.
c20448 +++$+++ Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...
c19694 +++$+++ No - that's not it!  She said her boyfriend stranded her up there! I didn't ask her to come with me!
c19694 +++$+++ Did you have sex with her?
c19694 +++$+++ What?
c19694 +++$+++ Did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question?
c19694 +++$+++ Then what did you do, play canasta?
c13936 +++$+++ I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
c13936 +++$+++ I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
c13936 +++$+++ Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
c13936 +++$+++ What are you saying?
c13936 +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
c13396 +++$+++ I had dozens of politicians and state officials comin' through that place every week.
c13396 +++$+++ Nice to see you, Senator.
c13396 +++$+++ Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
c13396 +++$+++ Certainly.  Senator.
c13396 +++$+++ We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
c06852 +++$+++ Hello, remember me?
c06852 +++$+++ Hell yeah, I remember you.
c06852 +++$+++ I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
c06852 +++$+++ I just wanted to give you this.
c21228 +++$+++ Have we in some way made you angry, Master?
c21228 +++$+++ You know better than that.
c21228 +++$+++ We don't know of anything, Master...
c21228 +++$+++ Then why do you shake so?
c21228 +++$+++ It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
c21228 +++$+++ Aaaahhhh.
c18226 +++$+++ Welcome. 38
c18226 +++$+++ You're JP Monroe, right?
c18226 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c18226 +++$+++ And this is your club.  Great club.  I really love it here.  Great club.
c18226 +++$+++ Thank you.
c18226 +++$+++ Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
c18226 +++$+++ It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
c18226 +++$+++ A prize?  For what?
c18226 +++$+++ You see, everyday I have my friend John here bring ...
c18226 +++$+++ The barman?  I thought he was called Rick?
c18226 +++$+++ He's a barman.  Whatever.  Do you mind if I continue?
c18226 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c18226 +++$+++ Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
c18226 +++$+++ Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
c04020 +++$+++ Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.
c04020 +++$+++ Yeah, sure...
c04020 +++$+++ Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
c04020 +++$+++ Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
c04020 +++$+++ Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
c04020 +++$+++ Great.  Gotta go.  See you then.
c03921 +++$+++ How does he know so much about me?
c03921 +++$+++ Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "Unique." That's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
c03921 +++$+++ Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
c03921 +++$+++ As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
c03921 +++$+++ On the desk, yes. In Latin.
c03921 +++$+++ Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
c03921 +++$+++ "In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
c08469 +++$+++ Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
c08469 +++$+++ Bimboo?
c08469 +++$+++ I just asked his name.
c27301 +++$+++ Walter --
c27301 +++$+++ Don't call me that.
c27301 +++$+++ Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
c27301 +++$+++ Wrong answers?
c27301 +++$+++ Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.
c16759 +++$+++ What it is?
c16759 +++$+++ Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
c16759 +++$+++ He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
c10177 +++$+++ It never came up.
c10177 +++$+++ You let me make a fool of myself.
c10177 +++$+++ You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
c10177 +++$+++ No.
c10177 +++$+++ You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
c01151 +++$+++ What's that?
c01151 +++$+++ Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
c01151 +++$+++ Seconds and thirds, too.
c01151 +++$+++ Sloan is all 'dat.  I try her.  I'm a tri-sexual.
c01151 +++$+++ Naw, just jokin'.  That's you. That's you.
c13613 +++$+++ You want to know how I kissed him?
c13613 +++$+++ Yes...
c13613 +++$+++ Are you jealous of him?
c13613 +++$+++ That's good...
c11770 +++$+++ He's not drunk, he's crazy.
c11770 +++$+++ Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
c11770 +++$+++ These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
c20524 +++$+++ Yeah, this is Sergeant Tanaka from Holenbeck, I need a current address for a Jeffrey....
c20524 +++$+++ Pommeroy.
c20524 +++$+++ Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
c20524 +++$+++ Could you hold on for a second?
c22949 +++$+++ You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
c22949 +++$+++ People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
c22949 +++$+++ What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
c22949 +++$+++ It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
c22949 +++$+++ Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
c22949 +++$+++ Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
c22949 +++$+++ You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
c22949 +++$+++ No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
c22949 +++$+++ That part of me is dead.
c06884 +++$+++ Are you sure?
c06884 +++$+++ I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
c06884 +++$+++ But...
c06884 +++$+++ Okay...
c06197 +++$+++ The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
c06197 +++$+++ And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included.
c06197 +++$+++ Do you know what she told me last night?
c02960 +++$+++ Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
c02960 +++$+++ "Dad."
c02960 +++$+++ Any brothers?  Sisters?
c02960 +++$+++ Dick, Jane, and Spot.
c02960 +++$+++ Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
c02960 +++$+++ Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
c02960 +++$+++ You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
c02960 +++$+++ Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh?
c15569 +++$+++ Shut up!
c15569 +++$+++ What's wrong, Trash?
c15569 +++$+++ What happened with the kid and Loew?
c15569 +++$+++ You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
c15569 +++$+++ Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
c17773 +++$+++ No, I think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
c17773 +++$+++ ...young boys, still...?
c17773 +++$+++ ...here's to child abuse!
c17773 +++$+++ Mmm...
c17773 +++$+++ ...and then, he'll be coming down.
c17773 +++$+++ You said the <u>bad</u> news...
c17773 +++$+++ Yes, I did.
c17773 +++$+++ I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
c17773 +++$+++ Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
c17773 +++$+++ I can make you rich.
c17773 +++$+++ And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men
c17773 +++$+++ Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
c17773 +++$+++ ..suitcase...locker...
c17773 +++$+++ Come on, Doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
c17773 +++$+++ ....what...?
c27420 +++$+++ Frederick Frankenstein?
c27420 +++$+++ Fron kon steen!
c27420 +++$+++ Are you putting me on?
c27420 +++$+++ No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
c27420 +++$+++ And do you also say Fro dereck?
c27420 +++$+++ No, Fred ereck.
c27420 +++$+++ Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
c27420 +++$+++ It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
c27420 +++$+++ You must be Igor.
c15148 +++$+++ Hello.  Hello, Leon.
c15148 +++$+++ Hello, Sonny.
c15148 +++$+++ How are you doing?
c15148 +++$+++ Well... I'm out of the hospital.
c15148 +++$+++ Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
c15148 +++$+++ I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
c15148 +++$+++ Well.... huh ...
c15148 +++$+++ Ooohh....
c15148 +++$+++ Oh... huh ... how you feeling?
c15148 +++$+++ I'm really shakey.
c15148 +++$+++ Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
c15148 +++$+++ Yeah.  It was terrible.
c15148 +++$+++ That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
c15148 +++$+++ You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm... you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?
c15148 +++$+++ Yeah...
c15148 +++$+++ You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now.
c15148 +++$+++ So... that sure is something.
c15148 +++$+++ Yeah.  So how are you?
c15148 +++$+++ Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am!
c15148 +++$+++ Yeah... I know.
c15148 +++$+++ I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
c15148 +++$+++ What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
c15148 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c15148 +++$+++ What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
c15148 +++$+++ Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit.
c15148 +++$+++ No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head...
c15148 +++$+++ I don't know what I'm doing.
c15148 +++$+++ Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people. This death business... I'm sorry!
c15148 +++$+++ I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
c15148 +++$+++ I'm sorry...
c15148 +++$+++ I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money.
c15148 +++$+++ But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank.
c15148 +++$+++ All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
c15148 +++$+++ Well...
c15148 +++$+++ I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
c15148 +++$+++ What trip?
c15148 +++$+++ I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
c15148 +++$+++ I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
c15148 +++$+++ I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man!
c15148 +++$+++ You're crazy.
c15148 +++$+++ That's it.
c15148 +++$+++ You're really crazy.
c15148 +++$+++ I know!
c15148 +++$+++ Where you gonna go?
c15148 +++$+++ Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go ... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria.
c15148 +++$+++ Why you going to Algeria?
c15148 +++$+++ Huh ... I don't know.  They got Howard Johnson's there.  I don't know why the fuck I'm going there for.
c15148 +++$+++ Howard Johnson's... you're warped. You know that?  You're really warped!
c15148 +++$+++ I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
c15148 +++$+++ God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there.
c15148 +++$+++ What am I supposed to do?
c15148 +++$+++ I don't know... you could have picked a better place.
c15148 +++$+++ Denmark?  Sweden?
c15148 +++$+++ Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.  I told him it wasn't a country.  We gotta get outta the country!  To hell with a guy who doesn't know where Wyoming is.  Okay.  Can you imagine what kind of a shape I'm in?
c19272 +++$+++ You spoil 'em, Cliff.
c19272 +++$+++ Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
c19272 +++$+++ She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
c08753 +++$+++ What's happening to us?
c08753 +++$+++ It's all right.
c08753 +++$+++ Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
c08753 +++$+++ Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
c06259 +++$+++ Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
c06259 +++$+++ Home.
c06259 +++$+++ I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
c06259 +++$+++ That's right.
c06259 +++$+++ Where?
c06259 +++$+++ Hospital.
c06259 +++$+++ Which hospital?
c06259 +++$+++ Back home.
c06259 +++$+++ No.  Or why you should.
c01215 +++$+++ Good day to you, young sir.
c01215 +++$+++ Good morning.
c01215 +++$+++ Where are you bound for?
c01215 +++$+++ That is none of your business.
c01215 +++$+++ Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
c16008 +++$+++ By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
c16008 +++$+++ No thanks.
c16008 +++$+++ No, I mean it.
c16008 +++$+++ So do I.
c16008 +++$+++ We gotta go, Jack.
c16008 +++$+++ No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
c16008 +++$+++ This time you gotta go.
c16008 +++$+++ I don't gotta go.
c16008 +++$+++ You gotta go.
c16008 +++$+++ Says who?
c16008 +++$+++ Your older brother.
c16008 +++$+++ Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
c04884 +++$+++ He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
c04884 +++$+++ Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
c04884 +++$+++ ...don't think so.  When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em.  These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza!  They took out the President of the United States!  That's entertainment!  And they served their country doing it.
c04884 +++$+++ ...and your General?
c04884 +++$+++ ...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
c04884 +++$+++ Ever ask him?
c04884 +++$+++ You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
c04884 +++$+++ Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
c08931 +++$+++ I know you... Do I not?
c08931 +++$+++ Yes. And I know you.
c08931 +++$+++ My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
c08931 +++$+++ You would have done the same for me.
c08931 +++$+++ Because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
c14556 +++$+++ I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.
c14556 +++$+++ What is it you do, Sami?
c14556 +++$+++ You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
c14556 +++$+++ Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave.
c08458 +++$+++ You talked to Wendy?
c08458 +++$+++ Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
c08458 +++$+++ Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
c08458 +++$+++ Uh-huh.  I'll be right back.
c05149 +++$+++ They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
c05149 +++$+++ No... I guess not.
c05149 +++$+++ What is your job title, exactly?
c05149 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c05149 +++$+++ I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
c05149 +++$+++ I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
c05149 +++$+++ Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
c05149 +++$+++ You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?
c27060 +++$+++ Dead?
c27060 +++$+++ Or was it, she wished he was dead - that's it - I believe he left the country with another woman - all rather sordid.
c27060 +++$+++ So she didn't mention anything more about it?
c27060 +++$+++ No - she isn't in any trouble is she?
c27060 +++$+++ I'll be sure to...
c11517 +++$+++ You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were --  It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
c11517 +++$+++ You usually eat alone?
c11517 +++$+++ Cheers.
c03891 +++$+++ Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
c03891 +++$+++ An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
c03891 +++$+++ And why is that?
c03891 +++$+++ Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
c03891 +++$+++ Just give me a rough estimate.
c03891 +++$+++ Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
c03891 +++$+++ Fifteen.
c03891 +++$+++ A rough estimate.
c03891 +++$+++ And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
c03891 +++$+++ No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother?
c15862 +++$+++ Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
c15862 +++$+++ Well, I hope you don't expect more.
c15862 +++$+++ Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
c27027 +++$+++ Why don't you let at do that...?
c27027 +++$+++ Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
c27027 +++$+++ Captain's orders.
c11961 +++$+++ I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
c11961 +++$+++ We gotta call the police -
c11961 +++$+++ Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
c11961 +++$+++ Yeah.
c11961 +++$+++ What do you think happened?
c11961 +++$+++ I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to -
c11961 +++$+++ Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
c11961 +++$+++ I believe you - I KNOW you. But why should the police?
c02064 +++$+++ Oh, Jake. You disappoint me. And you just let Lily here down again. What was it you said about playing the big con?
c02064 +++$+++ It's like putting on a play, where everyone knows their part except for the mark.
c02064 +++$+++ Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
c02064 +++$+++ So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three...
c25380 +++$+++ Who told you to wear men's clothes?
c25380 +++$+++ The clothes are not important...
c25380 +++$+++ You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
c25380 +++$+++ It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
c25380 +++$+++ So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
c25380 +++$+++ I... submit to Our Lord.
c25380 +++$+++ It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
c27037 +++$+++ Hi.
c27037 +++$+++ Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast...?  Maybe see a movie...?
c27037 +++$+++ Gotcha.
c09127 +++$+++ This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
c09127 +++$+++ Sulu!
c09127 +++$+++ Standing by, Captain Kirk.
c09127 +++$+++ You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
c09127 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
c09127 +++$+++ Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
c09127 +++$+++ The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
c09127 +++$+++ I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
c09127 +++$+++ I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
c15737 +++$+++ Why are we speaking Chinese?
c15737 +++$+++ Uh. I'm showing off.
c15737 +++$+++ A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
c15737 +++$+++ No you can't.
c15737 +++$+++ It's sold.
c18847 +++$+++ Hey, we were saving that!
c18847 +++$+++ For today, I guarantee it.
c18847 +++$+++ John Hammond.  And I am delighted to finally meet you in person Dr Grant.
c24911 +++$+++ 'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
c24911 +++$+++ Congratulations, Gina.
c24911 +++$+++ Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
c24911 +++$+++ It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, I'm sure.
c12449 +++$+++ That's the key to the city of Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was given two years ago in recognition of his various civic, uh.
c12449 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c12449 +++$+++ That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
c12449 +++$+++ Hey, is this him with Nancy?
c12449 +++$+++ That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
c12449 +++$+++ Lebowski on the right?
c12449 +++$+++ Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--
c12449 +++$+++ He's handicapped, huh?
c12449 +++$+++ Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
c12449 +++$+++ Far out.
c12449 +++$+++ And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
c12449 +++$+++ Nancy's pretty good.
c12449 +++$+++ Wonderful woman.  We were very--
c12449 +++$+++ Are these.
c12449 +++$+++ These are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak--
c12449 +++$+++ Different mothers, huh?
c12449 +++$+++ No, they--
c12449 +++$+++ I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
c12449 +++$+++ They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
c12449 +++$+++ I see.
c12449 +++$+++ --without  the means  for higher education, so Mr. Lebowski  has committed  to sending  all of them to college.
c12449 +++$+++ Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
c12449 +++$+++ One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
c12449 +++$+++ Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
c12449 +++$+++ Heh-heh--
c12449 +++$+++ --smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
c12449 +++$+++ --and bowling.  I'll tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!
c17691 +++$+++ Where're you going?
c17691 +++$+++ I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
c17691 +++$+++ Yeah, I know.  I-I can't believe I forgot.
c22671 +++$+++ Good luck, Captain.
c22671 +++$+++ Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
c22671 +++$+++ The men said, nine.
c22671 +++$+++ What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
c22671 +++$+++ Plenty.
c25750 +++$+++ It's bad.
c25750 +++$+++ We have to tell Mother and Cal.
c25750 +++$+++ Now it's worse.
c25750 +++$+++ Right.
c00214 +++$+++ What the bell happened?
c00214 +++$+++ I lost them, that's what happened.
c00214 +++$+++ They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
c13266 +++$+++ I'm going out the front.
c13266 +++$+++ Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
c13266 +++$+++ You say that like it's a bad thing.
c26114 +++$+++ Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
c26114 +++$+++ Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
c26114 +++$+++ Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
c26114 +++$+++ How 'bout yourself?
c26114 +++$+++ Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
c04688 +++$+++ I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
c04688 +++$+++ Howard is a beautiful person.
c04688 +++$+++ Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
c04688 +++$+++ Miles. Miles. Miles.
c04688 +++$+++ I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
c04688 +++$+++ It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
c04688 +++$+++ Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
c04688 +++$+++ I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
c22500 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c22500 +++$+++ Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
c22500 +++$+++ Quick.  Very quick.
c23149 +++$+++ Well, what do you think?
c23149 +++$+++ I'd cut it...
c23149 +++$+++ You would?
c23149 +++$+++ Yeah, I think so...
c23149 +++$+++ No, I'm sure.
c07673 +++$+++ Don't get upset.
c07673 +++$+++ Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
c07673 +++$+++ Where are you going ...
c07673 +++$+++ I don't think we should discuss this until I'm a little bit more composed.
c07673 +++$+++ WAIT A MINUTE!!
c07673 +++$+++ COME BACK!!!
c05932 +++$+++ ... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of Sudbury, Virginia?
c05932 +++$+++ Nothing.
c05932 +++$+++ Nope.  Nothing at all.
c11250 +++$+++ Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
c11250 +++$+++ Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
c11250 +++$+++ I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
c13630 +++$+++ She own you, Jimmy?
c13630 +++$+++ Yes.
c13630 +++$+++ She from Scotland too?
c13630 +++$+++ You could say that.
c13630 +++$+++ I can't.
c01324 +++$+++ This is why you don't show work in progress.
c01324 +++$+++ Norther, do you ever regret not making it to Paris?
c01324 +++$+++ You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
c24758 +++$+++ You promised you'd meet projections, Alan.  A dollar sixty per share you said.  So, I don't think this is so surprising a visit.
c24758 +++$+++ Projections were far too optimistic.
c24758 +++$+++ Admittedly...
c24758 +++$+++ Our E.P.S. was one fifty last quarter.  We're up eight cents per share.
c24758 +++$+++ But, the expectation was ten.  And, in this case, expectation is everything.
c24758 +++$+++ Will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
c24758 +++$+++ My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
c24758 +++$+++ The stock will turn.
c24758 +++$+++ It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
c24758 +++$+++ Because it's fair.  Give me next quarter.  If you still feel this way, vote your shares...
c24758 +++$+++ You're talking tomorrow.  Today is what counts.
c24758 +++$+++ You intractable son-of-a-bitch.  If your father could see you now...
c24758 +++$+++ Your father was a friend.  Goddamn it... I watched you grow up.  How do you end up treating me like this?
c06066 +++$+++ Dude, we were practically made...
c06066 +++$+++ I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
c06066 +++$+++ I'll be a minute.
c21110 +++$+++ Alright.  The truth is... I thought we had something here.
c21110 +++$+++ I can't believe you did that!
c21110 +++$+++ And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
c21110 +++$+++ You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
c21110 +++$+++ I sabotaged it?  You're the one who lost him, remember?
c21110 +++$+++ Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
c21110 +++$+++ As I recall, you were on your way home.  And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
c21110 +++$+++ A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
c21110 +++$+++ I would call it-- unforgivable.
c18494 +++$+++ Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
c18494 +++$+++ No, of course not.
c18494 +++$+++ Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
c18494 +++$+++ Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
c18494 +++$+++ You're nobody. You have no identity.
c02567 +++$+++ Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
c02567 +++$+++ I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
c02567 +++$+++ This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
c23971 +++$+++ Well.  It was a pleasure meeting you.
c23971 +++$+++ And likewise.
c23971 +++$+++ Goodbye.
c17059 +++$+++ What are we going to say?
c17059 +++$+++ No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
c17059 +++$+++ I'm not sure I have two.
c17059 +++$+++ I saw the board.  You've got four...
c17059 +++$+++ I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
c17059 +++$+++ Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
c17059 +++$+++ Good.  Now we're talking.
c06305 +++$+++ Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world!
c06305 +++$+++ Well, all those guys in the bleachers think--
c06305 +++$+++ Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
c06305 +++$+++ Against what?
c06305 +++$+++ Against anything. Just protest.
c06305 +++$+++ You got me.
c06305 +++$+++ Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
c06305 +++$+++ Oh, yuh did, huh?
c06305 +++$+++ Yes!
c06305 +++$+++ Grab it, Eddie, grab it!
c21263 +++$+++ Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
c21263 +++$+++ Let's go outside and talk.
c21263 +++$+++ Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
c01222 +++$+++ That's a very handsome sword you have there.
c01222 +++$+++ It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
c01222 +++$+++ I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
c24170 +++$+++ My crew is going to work alongside with your men, don't worry--we're a team!
c24170 +++$+++ Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
c24170 +++$+++ Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
c24170 +++$+++ You know, when we reach Kompong Som--
c11654 +++$+++ If Corbett's men find out --
c11654 +++$+++ -- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
c11654 +++$+++ Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
c12589 +++$+++ Hello?
c12589 +++$+++ Abby... you all right?
c12589 +++$+++ I don't know. It's early... I love you.
c21610 +++$+++ And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
c21610 +++$+++ Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
c21610 +++$+++ She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
c12474 +++$+++ Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
c12474 +++$+++ No, you're not wrong--
c12474 +++$+++ You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
c25098 +++$+++ Martins.
c25098 +++$+++ Coming to the point, please.
c25098 +++$+++ I have guests waiting.
c18998 +++$+++ Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
c18998 +++$+++ I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
c18998 +++$+++ You just don't get it, do you?  I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
c18998 +++$+++ I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
c18998 +++$+++ No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
c18998 +++$+++ What about Billy?
c18998 +++$+++ I'm not taking him with me.
c18998 +++$+++ What?
c18998 +++$+++ Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
c18998 +++$+++ C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that.  You're a terrific mother--
c18998 +++$+++ I am not!  I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother.  I yell at him all the time.  I have no patience.  No...No.  He's better off without me.  Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
c18998 +++$+++ NO!...Please...Please don't make me stay...I swear...If you do, sooner or later...maybe tomorrow, maybe next week...maybe a year from now...  I'll go right out the window.
c21274 +++$+++ You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
c21274 +++$+++ Nothing.
c21274 +++$+++ I mean if you didn't know who I was.
c21274 +++$+++ You'd probably tell me.
c21274 +++$+++ You have to be kidding.
c26290 +++$+++ It's nothing.  Really.
c26290 +++$+++ I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
c26290 +++$+++ That a fact?
c26290 +++$+++ I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
c26290 +++$+++ Yes, I have.
c26290 +++$+++ I . . . can't . . . argue . . .
c01097 +++$+++ Okay.
c01097 +++$+++ Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
c01097 +++$+++ No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
c01097 +++$+++ Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
c01097 +++$+++ Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
c01097 +++$+++ In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
c06864 +++$+++ Debo!  Debo!
c06864 +++$+++ What?
c06864 +++$+++ I can't feel my legs no more.
c06864 +++$+++ I don't know.
c04801 +++$+++ Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
c04801 +++$+++ Me?
c04801 +++$+++ Maybe.  Sure--sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd--  Yeah, but where you going to find her--somebody that's real--somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
c02172 +++$+++ Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby. Lieutenant?
c02172 +++$+++ Yes, Talby, what is it?
c02172 +++$+++ Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if anything important comes up.
c05044 +++$+++ Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
c05044 +++$+++ Why do you bring her up?
c05044 +++$+++ 'Cause she's always on your mind.
c05044 +++$+++ It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
c06734 +++$+++ Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
c06734 +++$+++ Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
c06734 +++$+++ This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
c06734 +++$+++ There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
c06734 +++$+++ It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
c06734 +++$+++ Really?
c06734 +++$+++ What'd I do?
c12616 +++$+++ And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
c12616 +++$+++ I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
c12616 +++$+++ Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
c12616 +++$+++ I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
c12616 +++$+++ Is Sandy part of this?
c12616 +++$+++ No. not at all.
c12616 +++$+++ Who knows you have these?
c12616 +++$+++ You're all through with this now?
c11936 +++$+++ Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-
c11936 +++$+++ Hello.
c11936 +++$+++ Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this - believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I - I'm sorry - listen, how are you - I'm sorry. You doing okay?
c11936 +++$+++ Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.
c16279 +++$+++ ...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
c16279 +++$+++ Naw, I... Executive Sales Manager.
c16279 +++$+++ Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
c16279 +++$+++ Uh-huh. Well, I'm a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and I was just wondering if you've had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass Ciera?
c09670 +++$+++ Are you sure?
c09670 +++$+++ Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
c09670 +++$+++ I need her exact name, you see.
c09670 +++$+++ That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
c09670 +++$+++ Yes?
c09670 +++$+++ Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
c09670 +++$+++ Thank you.
c09670 +++$+++ Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
c21858 +++$+++ How do you do.  Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say?
c21858 +++$+++ They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
c21858 +++$+++ I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
c12613 +++$+++ Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
c12613 +++$+++ I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
c12613 +++$+++ I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
c12613 +++$+++ And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
c20624 +++$+++ Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
c20624 +++$+++ I wrote a poem too.
c20624 +++$+++ Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
c20999 +++$+++ I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
c20999 +++$+++ Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
c20999 +++$+++ Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
c05038 +++$+++ Jake, is that you?
c05038 +++$+++ What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
c05038 +++$+++ Why didn't you turn on the light?
c05038 +++$+++ I didn't want to wake you.
c05038 +++$+++ Gee, thanks a lot.
c05038 +++$+++ Where is the lamp?
c05038 +++$+++ Where are you?
c05038 +++$+++ If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
c05038 +++$+++ Where to?
c24599 +++$+++ What's vermin again?
c24599 +++$+++ Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
c24599 +++$+++ Nicole?
c24599 +++$+++ Yes.
c24599 +++$+++ Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
c24599 +++$+++ Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
c24599 +++$+++ Okay.
c08542 +++$+++ Hello?
c08542 +++$+++ Hello, is this Elaine?
c08542 +++$+++ Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
c08542 +++$+++ Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
c08542 +++$+++ Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
c19713 +++$+++ He's a very shy boy...
c19713 +++$+++ What?
c19713 +++$+++ Something Lecktor said.
c19713 +++$+++ Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
c19713 +++$+++ It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight.
c14864 +++$+++ I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
c14864 +++$+++ I'm not sure.
c14864 +++$+++ I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
c14864 +++$+++ I'm not surprised.  Can we save anywhere?
c14864 +++$+++ Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
c14864 +++$+++ Choices?
c14864 +++$+++ You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
c14864 +++$+++ You could buy it on payments.
c14864 +++$+++ Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
c14864 +++$+++ So what do we do?
c14864 +++$+++ It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
c00512 +++$+++ So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
c00512 +++$+++ Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
c00512 +++$+++ You ever try to make a case in Slagtown?  The list of Newcomer informants is about as long as the list of Mexican war heroes...
c27249 +++$+++ Now you're seeing reason.
c27249 +++$+++ No --
c27249 +++$+++ Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
c01650 +++$+++ Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
c01650 +++$+++ Why not?
c01650 +++$+++ It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
c01650 +++$+++ It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
c01650 +++$+++ Yeah, but.
c01650 +++$+++ Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
c01650 +++$+++ OK.
c01650 +++$+++ Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
c01650 +++$+++ I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
c01650 +++$+++ I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
c01650 +++$+++ I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
c01650 +++$+++ Oh, okay, can I call?
c01650 +++$+++ Okay, yeah, call.
c01650 +++$+++ Look, it can wait till Sunday.
c01650 +++$+++ Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
c01650 +++$+++ Yeah.
c01650 +++$+++ I'm going to wait here until she comes.
c01650 +++$+++ I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
c03924 +++$+++ No, it doesn't make it right, but I stopped that creature, didn't I?
c03924 +++$+++ That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
c03924 +++$+++ What are you trying to say?
c03924 +++$+++ I wish I could be more gracious but --
c00105 +++$+++ Who's there?
c00105 +++$+++ Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
c00105 +++$+++ Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
c09050 +++$+++ Anij!
c09050 +++$+++ Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
c09050 +++$+++ It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
c23608 +++$+++ You don't want me, Sugar - I'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you've been running away from -
c23608 +++$+++ I know.  Every time!
c23608 +++$+++ That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
c25573 +++$+++ What kind of mine?
c25573 +++$+++ I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
c25573 +++$+++ Maybe that's all the Iraqis could afford, okay?  Maybe they got it on discount. Maybe the fuse is messed up.  Or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.
c04528 +++$+++ Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
c04528 +++$+++ Me? What'd I do?
c04528 +++$+++ Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
c04528 +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
c04528 +++$+++ The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
c04528 +++$+++ No.
c04528 +++$+++ You've heard of U.S.T.?
c04528 +++$+++ Then how'd I get here?
c17822 +++$+++ Yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today...
c17822 +++$+++ I don't understand.
c17822 +++$+++ You said:  that you have "decided." That your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  And get on with your job.
c17822 +++$+++ That's right.
c17822 +++$+++ And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
c17822 +++$+++ Yes.
c17822 +++$+++ And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
c17822 +++$+++ What is your point?
c17822 +++$+++ That if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  Why are you here...?
c17822 +++$+++ I..
c17822 +++$+++ ...yes...?
c17822 +++$+++ I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
c17822 +++$+++ You want some <u>advice</u>.
c17822 +++$+++ Yes.
c17822 +++$+++ Your life has been defined by institutions.  The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the Bureau.  If the Institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  Ask to be reinstated on the "Drumgo" task force.  Play their game.
c17822 +++$+++ Because it's the game you've chosen. That's really all we have time for.
c15307 +++$+++ Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
c15307 +++$+++ They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
c15307 +++$+++ I must do this for Paul, but what of my unborn child?
c26558 +++$+++ Thank you ...
c26558 +++$+++ ... that's perfectly all right.
c26558 +++$+++ To do right.  Isn't that why you're doing it?
c09411 +++$+++ I wish the game still had fights so I could bitch-slap Wayne.
c09411 +++$+++ This version doesn't have fighting?
c09411 +++$+++ What? That was the best part of the old game.
c13719 +++$+++ Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
c13719 +++$+++ Would you like to see my passport?
c13719 +++$+++ Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
c13719 +++$+++ Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
c13719 +++$+++ Sure.
c13719 +++$+++ Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
c13719 +++$+++ Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
c13719 +++$+++ Alexander.
c13719 +++$+++ Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
c13719 +++$+++ Yes, but we're divorced.
c13719 +++$+++ I thought that was Peter Joshua.
c13719 +++$+++ There -- you're a new man.
c05528 +++$+++ We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
c05528 +++$+++ Oh, yes...
c05528 +++$+++ A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
c05528 +++$+++ And then?
c05528 +++$+++ Yes?
c05528 +++$+++ What will become of me then?
c05528 +++$+++ When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
c05528 +++$+++ I see...
c05528 +++$+++ I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
c05528 +++$+++ Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
c05528 +++$+++ Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
c05528 +++$+++ My dear Princess, the human soul is a highly elusive commodity.  I suggest you spend some hours before the glass.  Contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul.
c20073 +++$+++ What you gonna do back there, East?
c20073 +++$+++ Lotta rich women back there...
c20073 +++$+++ Yeah?
c20073 +++$+++ Men, they mostly faggots.
c20073 +++$+++ Must be some mess back there.
c20073 +++$+++ Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
c20073 +++$+++ I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
c22397 +++$+++ Is it hot in here?
c22397 +++$+++ Hot?  I'm freezing my ass off.
c22397 +++$+++ What's going on?
c18938 +++$+++ Did you like my friend Frankie?
c18938 +++$+++ No.
c18938 +++$+++ Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
c18938 +++$+++ It didn't go anywhere.  But that's not why --
c18938 +++$+++ About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
c18938 +++$+++ Well -- she's dead.
c01047 +++$+++ That feels so great.
c01047 +++$+++ Good...
c01047 +++$+++ Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
c19027 +++$+++ Huh.. .Hello?
c19027 +++$+++ All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
c19027 +++$+++ Ted, what are you talking about?!
c19027 +++$+++ Don't play innocent with me, Thelma.  You know perfectly well what's going on.
c19027 +++$+++ Ha!  You tell me.
c20938 +++$+++ Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
c20938 +++$+++ Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
c20938 +++$+++ Did she always have nightmares?
c20938 +++$+++ They've gotten worse since I took away her credit cards.
c20938 +++$+++ I'm serious.
c20938 +++$+++ Look, Miss Thompson, I don't know what you want from me.
c20938 +++$+++ Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
c20938 +++$+++ I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
c20938 +++$+++ I'm sure you would.
c20938 +++$+++ Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
c20938 +++$+++ I'll need to take her things.
c20938 +++$+++ The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
c20938 +++$+++ First door up the stairs.
c18924 +++$+++ Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
c18924 +++$+++ Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
c18924 +++$+++ You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
c18924 +++$+++ Well we're pretty --
c18924 +++$+++ Why isn't he locked up?
c18924 +++$+++ We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
c18924 +++$+++ Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
c18924 +++$+++ I guess he figured it was better.
c18924 +++$+++ What was better? I made better bait?
c18924 +++$+++ No, that's not --
c18924 +++$+++ Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
c18924 +++$+++ From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
c18924 +++$+++ Here please.
c09160 +++$+++ So, human... you've met your better self!
c09160 +++$+++ What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
c09160 +++$+++ I'm preparing her for Shinzon. To sooth him as she soothes you. To stand at his side as she does at yours.
c09160 +++$+++ Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly...
c11303 +++$+++ Hey, listen, listen.
c11303 +++$+++ What?
c11303 +++$+++ Gimme a kiss.
c11303 +++$+++ Really?
c11303 +++$+++ Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
c11303 +++$+++ Yeah.
c11303 +++$+++ And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
c11303 +++$+++ Oh, all right.
c11303 +++$+++ And we'll digest our food better.
c11303 +++$+++ Okay.
c11303 +++$+++ Yeah.
c05104 +++$+++ I'm sending you the files.
c05104 +++$+++ Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient Farrari . . .
c05104 +++$+++ Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
c10756 +++$+++ How long is this going to take?
c10756 +++$+++ We have a few more minutes.
c10756 +++$+++ I mean, when will I be normal.
c10756 +++$+++ We have a lot of work to do.
c10756 +++$+++ Will I ever be normal?
c10756 +++$+++ I couldn't say.
c10756 +++$+++ You couldn't say.
c10756 +++$+++ I'm afraid not.
c10756 +++$+++ Do you know what "normal" is?
c10756 +++$+++ I suppose it's however society defines it.
c10756 +++$+++ How do you define it?
c10756 +++$+++ I don't.
c10756 +++$+++ Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
c10756 +++$+++ They usually tell me.
c10756 +++$+++ How do they know?
c10756 +++$+++ What is your idea of being normal?
c10756 +++$+++ What is your idea of being a Jew?
c10756 +++$+++ Whatever my ideas are of being a Jew is not going to help you.  Why don't we continue this on Thursday.
c10756 +++$+++ I want to be normal!
c10756 +++$+++ Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
c10756 +++$+++ Fuck you, Rosen!
c10756 +++$+++ I know --
c10756 +++$+++ I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
c13986 +++$+++ He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
c13986 +++$+++ I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
c13986 +++$+++ He thought she was great, Mr. Thompson. He really believed that.  He put all his ambition on that girl.  After she came along, he never really cared for himself like he used to.  Oh, I don't blame Susie -
c13986 +++$+++ Oh, yes.  He saw to that.  I tell you, Mr. Thompson, he was a hard man to figure out.  He had that funny sense of humor.  And then, too, maybe he thought by finishing that piece he could show Leland he was an honest man. You see, Leland didn't think so.  I guess he showed him all right.  He's a nice fellow, but he's a dreamer.  They were always together in those early days when we just started the Enquirer.
c20021 +++$+++ Why?
c20021 +++$+++ Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
c20021 +++$+++ Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
c20021 +++$+++ Why?
c22456 +++$+++ When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
c22456 +++$+++ I still have work to do here.
c22456 +++$+++ I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
c22456 +++$+++ After I left?
c22738 +++$+++ Okay.
c22738 +++$+++ Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
c22738 +++$+++ Okay.
c22738 +++$+++ So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
c22738 +++$+++ Good to know.
c22738 +++$+++ Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
c22738 +++$+++ Okay.
c22738 +++$+++ Not right now, thanks.
c15791 +++$+++ Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
c15791 +++$+++ If you hadn't used profanity --
c15791 +++$+++ Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
c15791 +++$+++ Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.
c10560 +++$+++ This your car?
c10560 +++$+++ Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
c10560 +++$+++ Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
c10560 +++$+++ New Orleans, huh?... We was just there.
c04603 +++$+++ Wait.
c04603 +++$+++ Why?
c04603 +++$+++ You can't take that.
c04603 +++$+++ The experiment. The danger...
c27272 +++$+++ Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!
c27272 +++$+++ Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
c27272 +++$+++ Well, that's you all over.
c05242 +++$+++ Casper! Was up kid?
c05242 +++$+++ Nothen' B.
c05242 +++$+++ Where you at?
c05242 +++$+++ Right here.
c05242 +++$+++ Where you goin' tonight?
c05242 +++$+++ Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
c05242 +++$+++ You goin'?
c05242 +++$+++ Yeah.
c05242 +++$+++ I'm goin'. You on the list?
c05242 +++$+++ I had a female vagina last night.
c01314 +++$+++ Hardly two stories in the whole place. Now I've heard in real cities, they've got buildings so tall you can't even see the tops of 'em.
c01314 +++$+++ Really?
c01314 +++$+++ Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
c01314 +++$+++ So why are you wasting your time in a small town? You're a big man. You should be in the big city.
c02590 +++$+++ You've got to listen...
c02590 +++$+++ To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
c02590 +++$+++ We're hanging on by our fingernails and you're giving me bullshit stories...
c01320 +++$+++ Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
c01320 +++$+++ I will.
c01320 +++$+++ I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
c21669 +++$+++ What have you been up to?
c21669 +++$+++ Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
c21669 +++$+++ The torture of small children--
c21669 +++$+++ On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
c21669 +++$+++ Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
c13781 +++$+++ Well?
c13781 +++$+++ She's still a virgin.
c13781 +++$+++ No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
c24084 +++$+++ Are you here?
c24084 +++$+++ I'm here.
c24084 +++$+++ Because you don't really seem here.
c24084 +++$+++ I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
c24084 +++$+++ You think I didn't get that?
c13327 +++$+++ Don't bump me.
c13327 +++$+++ It was a cocksucking call!
c13327 +++$+++ Did you call me a cocksucker?
c13327 +++$+++ No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
c13327 +++$+++ You missed the tag!
c13327 +++$+++ You spit on me!
c13327 +++$+++ I didn't spit on you!
c13327 +++$+++ You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
c13327 +++$+++ You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
c13327 +++$+++ You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
c13327 +++$+++ Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
c13327 +++$+++ Beg me!
c13327 +++$+++ Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
c13327 +++$+++ Beg me again!
c13327 +++$+++ Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
c13327 +++$+++ You're outta here!
c11145 +++$+++ How many fucking sources they think we got?--
c11145 +++$+++ --Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
c11145 +++$+++ --We got twenty minutes to deadline--
c09979 +++$+++ It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
c09979 +++$+++ He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
c09979 +++$+++ It don't matter.  Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
c11496 +++$+++ Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
c11496 +++$+++ No -- I like it.
c11496 +++$+++ Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
c11496 +++$+++ Of course not.
c11496 +++$+++ Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side --  is that better?
c11496 +++$+++ Much better.
c11496 +++$+++ Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
c11496 +++$+++ This is a bad day for me.
c11496 +++$+++ I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
c11496 +++$+++ I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
c11496 +++$+++ Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
c11496 +++$+++ He and I are like this.  Sent me a Christmas card. See?
c17574 +++$+++ What the hell are you doing?
c17574 +++$+++ It's cool, I'm just looking.
c17574 +++$+++ Yeah?
c08002 +++$+++ Where you going?
c08002 +++$+++ I don't know, but we can't stay here.
c08002 +++$+++ Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
c08002 +++$+++ Listen!  I know a place!  PLATO showed me before.  An old deserted mansion near the planetarium  Would you go with me?
c16590 +++$+++ Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
c16590 +++$+++ What's that?
c16590 +++$+++ He wrote me a nice deposition. He says he just received the drugs. You did the selling.
c16590 +++$+++ I didn't sell nothing! I didn't sell nothing! I just carried the drugs from the Chief to Sam.
c16590 +++$+++ Sure you did.
c16590 +++$+++ Twenty years.
c26657 +++$+++ It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
c26657 +++$+++ I've never run across one like that.
c26657 +++$+++ It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
c26657 +++$+++ Uh-huh!
c26657 +++$+++ What a pleasant hobby.
c04225 +++$+++ This puts me in a peculiar hole.
c04225 +++$+++ No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
c04225 +++$+++ But how do I know...?
c04225 +++$+++ Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
c04225 +++$+++ All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here!  Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
c14285 +++$+++ Right here.  In the 7th Street subway station.
c14285 +++$+++ What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
c14285 +++$+++ I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
c14285 +++$+++ They're big details, Jerry.
c14285 +++$+++ Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
c14285 +++$+++ A water main broke.
c14285 +++$+++ They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
c14285 +++$+++ Okay, I will.
c14285 +++$+++ If that's what you want.  Yes.
c24944 +++$+++ D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
c24944 +++$+++ Where the hell are you?
c24944 +++$+++ It's a little late, you son of a bitch.  There's a friggin' monster loose in here!  Get the FBI, the fire department.  Find metal cutters, cut through.  And bring a cannon.  The damn thing is huge.
c05674 +++$+++ I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
c05674 +++$+++ That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
c05674 +++$+++ Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
c07336 +++$+++ Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
c07336 +++$+++ Great.
c07336 +++$+++ Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
c07336 +++$+++ Yeah... Mmmm...
c07336 +++$+++ What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
c07336 +++$+++ But in what ways?
c09980 +++$+++ Oh shit.
c09980 +++$+++ What's wrong?
c09980 +++$+++ Stop.
c09980 +++$+++ I'm spinning.
c04735 +++$+++ I've been trying to nail George's for years, but he's very careful. I'll just keep having children. I think I'm pregnant, by the way.
c04735 +++$+++ Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
c04735 +++$+++ Who's Rex's guy?
c14509 +++$+++ It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
c14509 +++$+++ Yeah, I guess it's all right.
c14509 +++$+++ Are you all right?
c14509 +++$+++ That's a big question.
c14509 +++$+++ Something you did?
c06129 +++$+++ They were Hebrew, weren't they?
c06129 +++$+++ That's right.
c06129 +++$+++ As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
c06129 +++$+++ Just what is your question?
c06129 +++$+++ What color were the original Hebrews?
c06129 +++$+++ Then we don't know that God was white.
c12401 +++$+++ They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
c12401 +++$+++ Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
c12401 +++$+++ Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
c01819 +++$+++ And you got to him before we could.
c01819 +++$+++ I killed him???
c01819 +++$+++ I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
c07234 +++$+++ Sure you don't want any salad?
c07234 +++$+++ No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
c07234 +++$+++ I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
c07234 +++$+++ She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
c07234 +++$+++ All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
c22767 +++$+++ Thank you.
c22767 +++$+++ I need a drink.
c22767 +++$+++ Wine?
c05684 +++$+++ Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
c05684 +++$+++ There is no Boom-Boom Room.
c05684 +++$+++ When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
c05684 +++$+++ I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut.
c00400 +++$+++ You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
c00400 +++$+++ No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
c00400 +++$+++ We should talk.
c00400 +++$+++ We've done all our talking, Wade.
c00400 +++$+++ Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
c04480 +++$+++ No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
c04480 +++$+++ Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
c04480 +++$+++ Good point.
c25037 +++$+++ Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
c25037 +++$+++ I don't know, Mulder.
c25037 +++$+++ That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
c18933 +++$+++ Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
c18933 +++$+++ Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
c18933 +++$+++ Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
c09358 +++$+++ I don't think you understand.
c09358 +++$+++ What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
c09358 +++$+++ Perhaps you can explain it to him.  It's Agent Mackelway.
c00171 +++$+++ Well, thank you very much for being so understanding.
c00171 +++$+++ Please, it really doesn't matter.
c00171 +++$+++ Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
c00171 +++$+++ Yes, very pleasant.
c00171 +++$+++ Fine.
c14098 +++$+++ Are you open?
c14098 +++$+++ Yes.
c14098 +++$+++ Thirty-fire.
c15533 +++$+++ Whose shoe?
c15533 +++$+++ Susan Lefferts.
c15533 +++$+++ If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way.  What are these smears in the blood?
c15533 +++$+++ It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
c15533 +++$+++ Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
c03584 +++$+++ Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
c03584 +++$+++ Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
c03584 +++$+++ Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
c07241 +++$+++ I left my husband two days ago.
c07241 +++$+++ Really?
c07241 +++$+++ I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
c07241 +++$+++ Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
c07241 +++$+++ Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
c07241 +++$+++ Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
c07241 +++$+++ No. Loma Vista.
c07241 +++$+++ I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
c07241 +++$+++ How did you know?
c07241 +++$+++ What's his real name?
c07241 +++$+++ Dr. David Ravell.
c07241 +++$+++ No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
c16739 +++$+++ You used to be on the job?
c16739 +++$+++ Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
c16739 +++$+++ No.  What house you work?
c16443 +++$+++ And how'd you sneak up like that?
c16443 +++$+++ Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
c16443 +++$+++ I do?
c16443 +++$+++ You think you are... .
c16443 +++$+++ In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
c07142 +++$+++ I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss.
c07142 +++$+++ Llewelyn Moss?
c07142 +++$+++ You figure him for a dope runner?
c13601 +++$+++ You see that, Col?
c13601 +++$+++ Saw it, Dil.
c13601 +++$+++ Fuck it, is what I say.
c13601 +++$+++ Fucking men, Col --
c13589 +++$+++ Better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
c13589 +++$+++ I've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
c13589 +++$+++ Where's the backpack?
c13589 +++$+++ At those prices I'd just as soon your cabbie didn't get a look at me.
c16837 +++$+++ What do you want?
c16837 +++$+++ It's me. Nicky.
c16837 +++$+++ Nicky comes on Sunday's.
c16837 +++$+++ Where are your glasses? Go get them.
c16837 +++$+++ If it's you, what are you doing here?
c16837 +++$+++ Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
c00627 +++$+++ Where did I stop?
c00627 +++$+++ The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
c00627 +++$+++ So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
c00627 +++$+++ Consigned to flames of woe.
c00627 +++$+++ Do you believe in it?
c00627 +++$+++ What?
c00627 +++$+++ A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
c00627 +++$+++ Oh, yes.
c00627 +++$+++ Come. Let's begin.
c25078 +++$+++ What is going to happen? Where is Harry?
c25078 +++$+++ He's safe in the Russian zone.
c25078 +++$+++ I saw him today.
c13136 +++$+++ No.  No.
c13136 +++$+++ No?
c13136 +++$+++ Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
c13136 +++$+++ And the left side of your face is the good one.  Go again.  And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come on --
c15934 +++$+++ Quite frankly, we don't know much about it except that it's starts with some conflict or guilt that eventually leads to the patient's delusion that his body's been invaded by an alien intellegence; a spirit if you will.
c15934 +++$+++ Look, I'm telling you again and you'd better believe it, I'm not about to put her in a goddamn asylum!
c15934 +++$+++ It's-
c15934 +++$+++ And I don't care what you call it! I'm not putting her away!
c15934 +++$+++ You're sorry. Christ, eighty-eight doctors and all you can tell me is all of your bullshit...
c10892 +++$+++ No.
c10892 +++$+++ Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
c10892 +++$+++ Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
c10892 +++$+++ What does this have to do with..?
c15433 +++$+++ Um, yeah, I was gonna ...
c15433 +++$+++ What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
c15433 +++$+++ Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
c15433 +++$+++ Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
c15433 +++$+++ I batted!
c15433 +++$+++ You batted or you bunted?
c15433 +++$+++ Hey. I went as far as I felt comfortable. I mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. You work when you feel like it -- you know, Bruce Springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
c15433 +++$+++ Well, then I'm quitting.
c15433 +++$+++ Who's in it?
c14236 +++$+++ You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
c14236 +++$+++ Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
c14236 +++$+++ You prefer nights?
c14236 +++$+++ People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
c14236 +++$+++ You on some kind of work plan?
c14236 +++$+++ You mean like benefits?
c14236 +++$+++ Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
c14236 +++$+++ It's not that kind of job.
c14236 +++$+++ You should start a union.
c14236 +++$+++ Me, specifically?
c14236 +++$+++ Why not?
c14236 +++$+++ Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
c14236 +++$+++ Oh?  How long you been doing this?
c14236 +++$+++ Twelve years.  But I'm working on other stuff...
c14236 +++$+++ Like what?
c14236 +++$+++ None taken.  There are talkers and doers.  I like doers.
c18123 +++$+++ You know what the Scottish call it?
c18123 +++$+++ No.
c18123 +++$+++ Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
c18123 +++$+++ No, sir.
c18123 +++$+++ I hope we all get to do many things. Can we go now?
c08364 +++$+++ Mental instability?
c08364 +++$+++ He was adopted you know.
c08364 +++$+++ Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
c13619 +++$+++ Tell him to stop messing Dil around --
c13619 +++$+++ Dil --
c13619 +++$+++ I have to talk to her, Col --
c18250 +++$+++ So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince words...
c18250 +++$+++ Whatever.  You own Boardwalk, you own Park Place, you own the four railroads.  You think you're God. For all I know, you're probably right.  I just wanted to have a damn cappuccino, maybe play some Nintendo after I find out what it is.  Man, why didn't you just <u>buy</u> the horse?  What am I saying, you did buy it...
c18250 +++$+++ Oh... Let's see.  There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand.  We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved.  I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....
c18250 +++$+++ If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
c18250 +++$+++ I guess that's a no.
c22779 +++$+++ Don't do that. Hang up...call...
c22779 +++$+++ What? I can't hear you...
c22779 +++$+++ Hang up...call...
c22779 +++$+++ I'm losing you.
c22779 +++$+++ Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
c00042 +++$+++ Why'd you let him get to you?
c00042 +++$+++ Who?
c00042 +++$+++ Dorsey.
c00042 +++$+++ I hate him.
c00042 +++$+++ I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
c00042 +++$+++ Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
c00042 +++$+++ You know what they say
c13090 +++$+++ Is she dying?
c13090 +++$+++ She's having a baby. Twins.
c13090 +++$+++ Es impossible.
c13090 +++$+++ It's a miracle.
c14010 +++$+++ It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
c14010 +++$+++ I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
c14010 +++$+++ I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
c14010 +++$+++ It's the only vein I know.  I tell the facts the way I see them.  And any man that knows that facts -
c14010 +++$+++ I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
c14010 +++$+++ Thanks.
c14010 +++$+++ I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
c14010 +++$+++ You've made your point perfectly clear, Mr. Kane.  Good day.
c00322 +++$+++ How... how can you say that to me...?
c00322 +++$+++ Will you let me look?
c00322 +++$+++ You're probably right, and I probably won't find anything. I don't have a right to ask this, and you can kick me out of your house if you want, but this is my profession and there's a part of me that can't let it go.  Police are just as human as you or I.  They could have missed something.  They probably didn't.  Wouldn't you rather know?
c12141 +++$+++ Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
c12141 +++$+++ Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
c12141 +++$+++ But...
c12141 +++$+++ Well, I met someone...
c12141 +++$+++ Fast work. You just moved here.
c12141 +++$+++ You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
c12141 +++$+++ He sure did.
c12141 +++$+++ I said I'm sure he did.
c09312 +++$+++ I think I talked to him.
c09312 +++$+++ Who?
c09312 +++$+++ Speck. Harold Speck.
c09312 +++$+++ MyDick.
c06920 +++$+++ Where's Mom?
c06920 +++$+++ She's gone to Moundsville.
c06920 +++$+++ Yes, I reckon that's it.
c19911 +++$+++ -- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
c19911 +++$+++ Didn't the family get together last night --?
c19911 +++$+++ Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
c04982 +++$+++ This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
c04982 +++$+++ What do I do?
c04982 +++$+++ You ain't got to do nothing. Just point at it and push the button. You'll hear the car go "bleep." That means the alarm's off and the doors are open.
c04982 +++$+++ Now play the volume as loud as you want but don't touch my levels. I got them set just the way I want 'em.
c26249 +++$+++ Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
c26249 +++$+++ You do know me.  You helped me once.
c26249 +++$+++ I'm here about some monkeys.
c15248 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c15248 +++$+++ Come over around seven.
c15248 +++$+++ O'clock?
c15248 +++$+++ Gotcha.
c05295 +++$+++ Hello, Peter.
c05295 +++$+++ Who is this?
c05295 +++$+++ I haven't got time for this.
c22774 +++$+++ If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
c22774 +++$+++ There will be generations because of what you did.
c22774 +++$+++ You did so much.
c23126 +++$+++ I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
c23126 +++$+++ Calm down, baby.
c23126 +++$+++ I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
c23126 +++$+++ -- What?
c23126 +++$+++ Nummers.
c23126 +++$+++ -- Numbers, and I don't need to place myself in that kind of position.
c06450 +++$+++ Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
c06450 +++$+++ He's trying to make it.
c06450 +++$+++ He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
c06450 +++$+++ He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
c06450 +++$+++ What the fuck does that mean?
c06450 +++$+++ You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
c06450 +++$+++ So he can talk to all the families behind your back? Maybe have his own meet at 3:00 AM under the goddamn boardwalk? No. You're too smart for a sucker play.
c19400 +++$+++ I don't want to go back tomorrow.
c19400 +++$+++ I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
c19400 +++$+++ I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
c12370 +++$+++ I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
c12370 +++$+++ My tits?
c12370 +++$+++ Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
c22202 +++$+++ Make it dry.  Baby doesn't like to be wet.  You're Valiant, right?  The name's Baby Herman.
c22202 +++$+++ I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
c22202 +++$+++ Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
c22202 +++$+++ You don't believe that.  I mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. I know the guy.
c05664 +++$+++ Do you know anything about building a house?
c05664 +++$+++ No.
c05664 +++$+++ Okay.
c11278 +++$+++ Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
c11278 +++$+++ You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
c11278 +++$+++ Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
c11278 +++$+++ Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
c11278 +++$+++ I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
c02831 +++$+++ Nothing. Still nothing.
c02831 +++$+++ It's been months. It's not like him.
c02831 +++$+++ Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
c02831 +++$+++ So have I
c02831 +++$+++ I should go. I should leave today.
c02831 +++$+++ Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
c02831 +++$+++ Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
c02493 +++$+++ I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
c02493 +++$+++ Yeah.
c02493 +++$+++ I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
c02493 +++$+++ This is our first "date" date.
c02493 +++$+++ Do you remember what we talked about?
c02493 +++$+++ Naomi, I guess.
c02493 +++$+++ Yeah.
c02493 +++$+++ What was I wearing?
c02493 +++$+++ God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
c02493 +++$+++ No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
c08013 +++$+++ How did you know that?
c08013 +++$+++ We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
c08013 +++$+++ But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
c08013 +++$+++ We were romantic then too--
c08013 +++$+++ Are you and Mom home tonight?
c08013 +++$+++ No.  Why?
c08013 +++$+++ Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
c08013 +++$+++ Daddy--
c06094 +++$+++ Yeah.
c06094 +++$+++ What?
c06094 +++$+++ That's none of your fucking business.
c11415 +++$+++ Happy anniversary.
c11415 +++$+++ It's a Calder.
c11415 +++$+++ I know.
c11415 +++$+++ He's my favorite.
c11415 +++$+++ Ah...
c14985 +++$+++ I have to go.
c14985 +++$+++ But you must come in.
c14985 +++$+++ No, I --
c14985 +++$+++ But I insist.
c14985 +++$+++ You are frightened, no?
c20896 +++$+++ Gus?
c20896 +++$+++ No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
c20896 +++$+++ I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
c22612 +++$+++ Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
c22612 +++$+++ This man sounds like a real catch.
c22612 +++$+++ Colette ...
c11865 +++$+++ Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
c11865 +++$+++ I'd work backstage or something?
c11865 +++$+++ Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
c11865 +++$+++ You don't. That's the point.
c23587 +++$+++ Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
c23587 +++$+++ Not very likely.
c23587 +++$+++ Are you staying at the hotel?
c23587 +++$+++ Not at all.
c23587 +++$+++ Your face is familiar.
c23587 +++$+++ Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
c23587 +++$+++ That must be it.
c23587 +++$+++ Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
c23587 +++$+++ Your view of what?
c23587 +++$+++ You have a yacht?
c24646 +++$+++ Can I come out?  No.
c24646 +++$+++ I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
c24646 +++$+++ You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
c24646 +++$+++ No.  You're dead, son - get yourself buried!
c07709 +++$+++ I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
c07709 +++$+++ It's fine. It was fun, though.
c07709 +++$+++ No. Not at all. It's nice.
c17024 +++$+++ Yes.
c17024 +++$+++ What will he pay?
c17024 +++$+++ A buck a shot.
c17024 +++$+++ For five thousand?
c17024 +++$+++ However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
c17024 +++$+++ Yes.  Twenty-five hundred apiece.  One night's work, and the job with Graff.  Working the premium leads.
c12125 +++$+++ Letters in the alphabet.
c12125 +++$+++ Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
c12125 +++$+++ How about, MR. E.
c12125 +++$+++ Mystery.
c12125 +++$+++ And another name for Mystery?
c12125 +++$+++ Exactly. Mr. E. Mister Edward Nygma.
c20660 +++$+++ You're going to say it, aren't you?
c20660 +++$+++ Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
c20660 +++$+++ I'm taking my next book to Viking.
c20660 +++$+++ Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
c20660 +++$+++ I'm moving this book to Viking.
c20660 +++$+++ Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
c20660 +++$+++ To belong to someone.
c18934 +++$+++ Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
c18934 +++$+++ Most of them.
c18934 +++$+++ Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
c18934 +++$+++ How would I remember?
c18934 +++$+++ You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
c00012 +++$+++ That's not
c00012 +++$+++ I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
c00012 +++$+++ I guess I thought I was protecting you.
c00012 +++$+++ God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
c00012 +++$+++ I guess I'll never know, will I?
c19718 +++$+++ Who is it?
c19718 +++$+++ It's me.
c19718 +++$+++ Who?
c19718 +++$+++ Francis...?
c25352 +++$+++ No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
c25352 +++$+++ Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
c25352 +++$+++ No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
c25352 +++$+++ We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
c25352 +++$+++ Yes, probably... maybe...
c25352 +++$+++ So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
c25352 +++$+++ Yes, but...
c25352 +++$+++ Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
c25352 +++$+++ No, I... I held it up to...
c25352 +++$+++ You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
c25352 +++$+++ Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
c25352 +++$+++ No, I... I never killed anyone!
c16825 +++$+++ Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
c16825 +++$+++ Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
c16825 +++$+++ Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
c16825 +++$+++ You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
c16825 +++$+++ Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
c09427 +++$+++ Be my friend.
c09427 +++$+++ Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
c09427 +++$+++ Some day, and that day may never come, I would like to call upon you to do me a service in return.
c00021 +++$+++ You know French?
c00021 +++$+++ Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
c00021 +++$+++ Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
c00021 +++$+++ You could consecrate with her, my friend.
c09166 +++$+++ But she's not the Enterprise.
c09166 +++$+++ I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
c09166 +++$+++ Anything.
c09166 +++$+++ I intend to.
c22696 +++$+++ Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.
c22696 +++$+++ How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
c22696 +++$+++ Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
c23539 +++$+++ I think they got me.
c23539 +++$+++ They got the bull-fiddle.
c23539 +++$+++ Not yet.  But if those guys catch us, there'll be blood all over.  Type O.
c10908 +++$+++ We'll see about that.
c10908 +++$+++ Don't deny it!
c10908 +++$+++ I haven't decided yet.
c10908 +++$+++ The woman's health is at stake.
c10908 +++$+++ Her spiritual health.
c10908 +++$+++ I know you don't.
c15870 +++$+++ Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
c15870 +++$+++ No hard feelings?
c15870 +++$+++ Are you kidding?
c15870 +++$+++ I'll bet.
c24774 +++$+++ Take the picture out.
c24774 +++$+++ What's wrong?
c24774 +++$+++ I don't...
c23534 +++$+++ Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
c23534 +++$+++ Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
c23534 +++$+++ It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
c23534 +++$+++ How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
c23534 +++$+++ You're right, Joe.
c23534 +++$+++ Of course I am.
c23534 +++$+++ First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
c23534 +++$+++ No we're not.
c23534 +++$+++ We're not?
c23534 +++$+++ First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
c23534 +++$+++ You're going to bet my money on a dog?
c23534 +++$+++ He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
c23534 +++$+++ What are you giving me with the rabbit?
c23534 +++$+++ Look at those odds - ten to one. If he wins, we can pay everybody.
c23534 +++$+++ But suppose he loses?
c23534 +++$+++ What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
c23534 +++$+++ Jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black? Suppose you get hit by a truck? Suppose the stock market crashes?
c19645 +++$+++ Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
c19645 +++$+++ You can't do it.
c19645 +++$+++ Pull them back!
c19645 +++$+++ Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!
c22893 +++$+++ Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy?
c22893 +++$+++ Keeping my eye on Sidney.
c22893 +++$+++ Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
c22893 +++$+++ Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
c22893 +++$+++ There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
c22893 +++$+++ Have you contacted the bureau?
c22893 +++$+++ They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
c22893 +++$+++ You think he could still be in town?
c22893 +++$+++ He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney?
c22893 +++$+++ She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
c22893 +++$+++ Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
c22893 +++$+++ She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
c22893 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c12906 +++$+++ What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
c12906 +++$+++ Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
c12906 +++$+++ Then fuck it!!!
c01704 +++$+++ Did you see what I meant about the window?
c01704 +++$+++ Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
c01704 +++$+++ That's true. But what if they change the locks?
c01704 +++$+++ Who knows? That's why I filed it down.
c08257 +++$+++ I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
c08257 +++$+++ One believes --- it's like any other religion...
c08257 +++$+++ I'd hardly describe It that way --- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
c08257 +++$+++ It seems right to us.
c08257 +++$+++ I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice ---- that's it, isn't it?
c08257 +++$+++ Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
c08257 +++$+++ I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
c06184 +++$+++ Did you sleep alright?
c06184 +++$+++ Yes.
c06184 +++$+++ How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
c06184 +++$+++ In a week you should be fine.
c15942 +++$+++ Good morning Madame.
c15942 +++$+++ Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
c15942 +++$+++ Uh huh. 'Fraid so.
c11263 +++$+++ Anya, wait!
c11263 +++$+++ Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
c11263 +++$+++ No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
c24672 +++$+++ ... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
c24672 +++$+++ You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
c24672 +++$+++ I can't
c24672 +++$+++ Oh.  I can't, honey.  I'm on a roll here.
c13708 +++$+++ Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
c13708 +++$+++ But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
c13708 +++$+++ We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
c13708 +++$+++ But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
c13708 +++$+++ C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
c13708 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
c13708 +++$+++ I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
c13708 +++$+++ Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
c13708 +++$+++ That's the spirit.
c13708 +++$+++ Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
c13708 +++$+++ We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
c13708 +++$+++ Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
c13708 +++$+++ No, Mrs. Lampert.
c13708 +++$+++ But no one actually saw him die.
c13708 +++$+++ No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
c13708 +++$+++ Oh. Then who's this one?
c13708 +++$+++ I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
c13708 +++$+++ Me? Why me?
c13708 +++$+++ Agents.
c23752 +++$+++ She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.
c23752 +++$+++ Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
c23752 +++$+++ I'd buy it!
c05466 +++$+++ How long have I been here?
c05466 +++$+++ Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
c05466 +++$+++ I don't know.  I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
c05466 +++$+++ There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
c05466 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c05466 +++$+++ What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
c05466 +++$+++ Sera...
c05466 +++$+++ Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
c05466 +++$+++ Me neither.
c05466 +++$+++ So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
c05466 +++$+++ Sera you are crazy.
c05466 +++$+++ So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
c05466 +++$+++ Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
c05466 +++$+++ You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
c26936 +++$+++ I didn't want to come.
c26936 +++$+++ Then why did you?
c26936 +++$+++ Because he was worried about me.
c26936 +++$+++ Your husband?
c26936 +++$+++ Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
c26936 +++$+++ No.
c04748 +++$+++ What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
c04748 +++$+++ Nothing.
c04748 +++$+++ You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm--I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions--I--  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
c04748 +++$+++ Oh, no.
c04748 +++$+++ Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
c08277 +++$+++ So what about kids?
c08277 +++$+++ Kids? What about them?
c08277 +++$+++ Do you want them?
c08277 +++$+++ Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
c08277 +++$+++ I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
c21737 +++$+++ Four thousand.
c21737 +++$+++ Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
c21737 +++$+++ But you want days too.
c21737 +++$+++ All right, two thousand.
c21737 +++$+++ Three.
c21737 +++$+++ Holy shit.
c21040 +++$+++ Mister McMurphy.
c21040 +++$+++ Yes, ma'am?
c21040 +++$+++ Welcome back.
c21040 +++$+++ Thank you, ma'am.
c21040 +++$+++ Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
c09442 +++$+++ Things went badly in Palermo?
c09442 +++$+++ The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
c09442 +++$+++ Is that why there are more men on the walls?
c09442 +++$+++ Even so, I don't think it is safe here anymore.  I've made plans to move you to a villa near Siracuse. You must go right away.
c09442 +++$+++ Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
c22580 +++$+++ Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero. Defective fuse?  Well, you're all in one piece. So what's the beef?
c22580 +++$+++ You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
c22580 +++$+++ So much the better.
c02338 +++$+++ From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!
c02338 +++$+++ He should be king!
c02338 +++$+++ And everything.  He should be king!
c07823 +++$+++ Magic
c07823 +++$+++ Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
c07823 +++$+++ Not for me.
c07823 +++$+++ Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
c07823 +++$+++ You're a laugh-riot, kid.
c15287 +++$+++ How much homework is there?
c15287 +++$+++ That's the downside. There is none.
c15287 +++$+++ You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
c10017 +++$+++ Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
c10017 +++$+++ Yeah.
c10017 +++$+++ Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
c10017 +++$+++ You mean now or before?
c10017 +++$+++ Before.
c10017 +++$+++ I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
c10017 +++$+++ What little dogs?
c10017 +++$+++ You know those little dogs you see people with?
c10017 +++$+++ Like a Chihuahua?
c10017 +++$+++ Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
c10017 +++$+++ Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
c10017 +++$+++ Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
c10017 +++$+++ Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
c10017 +++$+++ I can see that.
c10017 +++$+++ I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
c10017 +++$+++ Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
c11908 +++$+++ I came in the front.
c11908 +++$+++ How bad off is he?
c11908 +++$+++ I can look and see.
c11908 +++$+++ Well... I don't think that'd work.
c15284 +++$+++ Well, something stinks.
c15284 +++$+++ Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
c15284 +++$+++ So no small talk? Good, 'cause I don't know how to make that. Yep. Small talk. Not for me. Not a fan.  Got any hobbies? How 'bout this weather?
c04117 +++$+++ Finish your prayers?
c04117 +++$+++ Finish yours?
c04117 +++$+++ So sure?
c24861 +++$+++ In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
c24861 +++$+++ Sewing mailbags?  Me?  Never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. Wasn't about to start when I was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
c24861 +++$+++ And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
c24861 +++$+++ Well, that kind of security can't be bought.  Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
c16823 +++$+++ I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
c16823 +++$+++ I go to college. I thought you knew.
c16823 +++$+++ Do you want to get some coffee?
c16823 +++$+++ What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
c23548 +++$+++ Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
c23548 +++$+++ Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
c23548 +++$+++ Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
c23548 +++$+++ Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
c23548 +++$+++ Oh, no.  I'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy.
c20883 +++$+++ Gus, have you ever been in love?
c20883 +++$+++ Leave.
c20883 +++$+++ Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
c20883 +++$+++ You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
c08392 +++$+++ Oh, that's tasty.
c08392 +++$+++ 100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
c08392 +++$+++ Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
c08392 +++$+++ Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
c08392 +++$+++ Just tell me.
c08392 +++$+++ Sure is tasty.
c06506 +++$+++ I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
c06506 +++$+++ Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
c06506 +++$+++ You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
c06506 +++$+++ I'd love to.
c07927 +++$+++ Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
c07927 +++$+++ It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
c07927 +++$+++ I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
c21699 +++$+++ I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
c21699 +++$+++ Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
c21699 +++$+++ Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
c00553 +++$+++ And how are we today?
c00553 +++$+++ Terrible.
c00553 +++$+++ Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
c00553 +++$+++ Just a couple of days.  Do you feel up to a visitor?
c06614 +++$+++ You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
c06614 +++$+++ I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
c06614 +++$+++ Good! Good!  Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy.  Babe, I could kiss you!
c06614 +++$+++ Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
c06614 +++$+++ Sure.
c06614 +++$+++ You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
c12494 +++$+++ Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--
c12494 +++$+++ Dude?
c12494 +++$+++ Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
c12494 +++$+++ I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
c12494 +++$+++ Huh?
c12494 +++$+++ Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
c12494 +++$+++ It is a fucking emergency.
c12494 +++$+++ I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
c12494 +++$+++ THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
c12494 +++$+++ WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!
c03441 +++$+++ We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
c03441 +++$+++ Tomorrow?
c03441 +++$+++ Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
c03441 +++$+++ We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?
c08282 +++$+++ It's a personal project I'm working on.
c08282 +++$+++ What kind of personal project?
c08282 +++$+++ Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
c08282 +++$+++ Who's Donna?
c08282 +++$+++ Donna?
c08282 +++$+++ Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
c08282 +++$+++ Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
c08282 +++$+++ Not really.
c06239 +++$+++ Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
c06239 +++$+++ Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
c06239 +++$+++ What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
c01823 +++$+++ Looks like he's been detained.
c01823 +++$+++ Who's going? Us?
c01823 +++$+++ Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
c05198 +++$+++ What would be a good time for you?
c05198 +++$+++ I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
c05198 +++$+++ Don't mock me.
c02930 +++$+++ You know him.
c02930 +++$+++ Sounds familiar.
c02930 +++$+++ It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
c02930 +++$+++ Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
c02930 +++$+++ Absolutely not.
c03421 +++$+++ Benjamin --
c03421 +++$+++ Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
c03421 +++$+++ Of course not.
c02021 +++$+++ Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
c02021 +++$+++ It will be okay.
c02021 +++$+++ We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
c02332 +++$+++ Well, you know, I think everyone's doing really well considering the fact that she was so young.
c02332 +++$+++ It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
c02332 +++$+++ Yeah.
c23616 +++$+++ It was such a long time ago.
c23616 +++$+++ Still--
c23616 +++$+++ If Ed ever found out....
c23616 +++$+++ And she wonders why I swim to the bottom of a Lemondrop every time I see her.
c06457 +++$+++ And how many soldiers do you have?
c06457 +++$+++ I've got friends.
c06457 +++$+++ An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
c17489 +++$+++ They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
c17489 +++$+++ Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
c17489 +++$+++ You have a headache?
c17489 +++$+++ I have a headache. You have a headache?
c17489 +++$+++ You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
c08442 +++$+++ The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
c08442 +++$+++ How long have you been into wine?
c08442 +++$+++ I started to get serious about seven years ago.
c08442 +++$+++ Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
c08892 +++$+++ What?
c08892 +++$+++ During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
c08892 +++$+++ The Farpoint mission? Data, that was seven years ago.
c08892 +++$+++ Thanks.
c00474 +++$+++ Simon, what's happening?!
c00474 +++$+++ He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
c00474 +++$+++ We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
c25778 +++$+++ Inspector McKinney.
c25778 +++$+++ Are you screwy?
c25778 +++$+++ You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
c23465 +++$+++ So you're just going to give up and go home?
c23465 +++$+++ I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
c23465 +++$+++ Still, you can't just write her off.
c23465 +++$+++ Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
c23465 +++$+++ She's just a kid. There's time for more babies later. After she grows up.
c23465 +++$+++ Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
c23465 +++$+++ Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
c23465 +++$+++ I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
c23465 +++$+++ No you're not.
c23465 +++$+++ Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
c23465 +++$+++ Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
c23465 +++$+++ No, bully for you.
c08177 +++$+++ It was you...
c08177 +++$+++ Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
c08177 +++$+++ Both of them?
c08177 +++$+++ Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
c08177 +++$+++ Now you'll be mine, Cindy.
c22250 +++$+++ So thrive my soul--
c22250 +++$+++ A thousand times good night! Exit, above
c22250 +++$+++ A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
c22250 +++$+++ Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
c22250 +++$+++ I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
c16423 +++$+++ That's why I was there last night.
c16423 +++$+++ I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
c16423 +++$+++ What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
c25148 +++$+++ Tell me about Lina Moebius.
c25148 +++$+++ How did you...?
c25148 +++$+++ I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
c25148 +++$+++ You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
c25148 +++$+++ With the shoes... There was more than one?
c20735 +++$+++ What do you think of him?
c20735 +++$+++ Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
c20735 +++$+++ You go to school together?
c20735 +++$+++ No, we never did that
c20735 +++$+++ Oh --
c20735 +++$+++ We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
c20735 +++$+++ Well, I really think he's got a chance.
c20735 +++$+++ You do?
c20735 +++$+++ Oh yea -- There has never been a better time for something new.
c20735 +++$+++ He ain't really new.
c20735 +++$+++ He is to a lot of people.
c20735 +++$+++ He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
c20735 +++$+++ You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
c20735 +++$+++ Where are you from?
c20735 +++$+++ Southern California.
c20735 +++$+++ You always live there?
c20735 +++$+++ Spent time in Arizona. Why?
c20735 +++$+++ Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
c20735 +++$+++ I know a couple.
c20735 +++$+++ No kidding -- Wait till I tell Linnea. Who?
c20735 +++$+++ Ah... Peter Finch.
c20735 +++$+++ Who?
c20735 +++$+++ Peter Finch -- he's English.
c20735 +++$+++ I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
c20735 +++$+++ Ryan O'Neal.
c20735 +++$+++ You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
c20735 +++$+++ Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
c20735 +++$+++ I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
c20735 +++$+++ I'll be dammed.
c14363 +++$+++ You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
c14363 +++$+++ How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
c14363 +++$+++ I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
c14363 +++$+++ For managing the truth.  But the truth won't be managed, sir.  It stops being the truth the moment you try.
c04994 +++$+++ I'm going out for a few hours.
c04994 +++$+++ Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
c04994 +++$+++ I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
c04994 +++$+++ Watcha gonna see?
c04994 +++$+++ Have fun.
c16017 +++$+++ Awe inspiring.
c16017 +++$+++ Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
c16017 +++$+++ Get out of here.
c16017 +++$+++ Come on, stand still.
c16017 +++$+++ Get out of here!
c16017 +++$+++ I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.
c00387 +++$+++ Are we going in this?
c00387 +++$+++ Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
c00387 +++$+++ It's pretty old.
c00387 +++$+++ It belongs to Pop.
c00387 +++$+++ Pop?
c00387 +++$+++ Oh.
c03660 +++$+++ Jimmy, what are you doing?
c03660 +++$+++ Checking out your place.
c03660 +++$+++ And miss the big game?  No way.
c19061 +++$+++ It seems like we're getting lower.
c19061 +++$+++ It happens when I land.
c19061 +++$+++ Why are we landing?
c19061 +++$+++ <u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
c02450 +++$+++ How did he do that?
c02450 +++$+++ Do what?
c02450 +++$+++ Vanish into thin air?
c02450 +++$+++ Well, where is he then?
c18262 +++$+++ Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
c18262 +++$+++ ...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
c18262 +++$+++ I'm sure I --
c18262 +++$+++ Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
c18262 +++$+++ Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
c09690 +++$+++ I don't know you.
c09690 +++$+++ Ahhh, but I know you.
c09690 +++$+++ How?
c09690 +++$+++ We met in court.
c09690 +++$+++ We never met in court or anyplace else.
c09690 +++$+++ That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
c09690 +++$+++ When?
c09690 +++$+++ Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
c09690 +++$+++ I didn't break that window!
c09690 +++$+++ No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
c09690 +++$+++ What are you? A policeman?
c09690 +++$+++ I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
c09690 +++$+++ What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
c09690 +++$+++ Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
c09690 +++$+++ You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
c09690 +++$+++ Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
c09690 +++$+++ I think you're a louse.
c09690 +++$+++ I am.  Good day.  Madam.
c09690 +++$+++ I'll find something else.  See you in court some day.
c03857 +++$+++ Eh, no. Thank you.
c03857 +++$+++ You're welcome.  Did you know him?
c03857 +++$+++ Eh, no.
c03857 +++$+++ Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
c03857 +++$+++ I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
c24384 +++$+++ Go away.  Go to that girl of yours.
c24384 +++$+++ Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
c24384 +++$+++ Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
c24384 +++$+++ I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
c25300 +++$+++ Hello, Jane. It's me.
c25300 +++$+++ Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
c25300 +++$+++ Carlos De Moraes?
c25300 +++$+++ Thank you, Jane.
c11749 +++$+++ She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
c11749 +++$+++ Thank you.
c11749 +++$+++ Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
c11749 +++$+++ No.
c11749 +++$+++ No?
c11749 +++$+++ It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
c11749 +++$+++ I know.  It makes me crazy.
c11749 +++$+++ Why?
c11749 +++$+++ I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
c11749 +++$+++ And you were drilling these holes...?
c11749 +++$+++ So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
c11749 +++$+++ Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
c11749 +++$+++ He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
c11749 +++$+++ He believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  I watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  I thought my mother was going to kill my father. Then they went into their room and made up.  And I watched them make love through the keyhole.
c23754 +++$+++ And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
c23754 +++$+++ Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
c23754 +++$+++ Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
c23754 +++$+++ Wish me luck.
c22248 +++$+++ Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
c22248 +++$+++ If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
c22248 +++$+++ Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
c22248 +++$+++ Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
c22248 +++$+++ Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
c22248 +++$+++ Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
c22248 +++$+++ Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
c22248 +++$+++ Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
c22248 +++$+++ Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
c22248 +++$+++ You kiss by the book.
c11395 +++$+++ Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
c11395 +++$+++ Monica.
c11395 +++$+++ And you know our friends, how?
c11395 +++$+++ We live next door.
c11395 +++$+++ Oh.  You're them.
c11395 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c11395 +++$+++ You have?
c02522 +++$+++ It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
c02522 +++$+++ Yeah.
c02522 +++$+++ You love him, don't you?
c11430 +++$+++ Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
c11430 +++$+++ Don't go in, Ryan.
c11430 +++$+++ Let's just go home, okay?
c27348 +++$+++ What game is that?
c27348 +++$+++ Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
c27348 +++$+++ You wanna check it out? Come here.
c16221 +++$+++ I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
c16221 +++$+++ Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
c16221 +++$+++ I'm sure I can come up with something.
c11655 +++$+++ Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
c11655 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c11655 +++$+++ Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
c11655 +++$+++ I'm real sorry.  In a while, you're gone from this country. But we live here.  No one wants to mix it up with those hombres.
c14411 +++$+++ I am not going to look at any more pictures.  They're like a disease. They get into my head.  I can't get them out.
c14411 +++$+++ I don't look at pictures.  I look at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel infected.
c14411 +++$+++ I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
c20862 +++$+++ Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
c20862 +++$+++ People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
c20862 +++$+++ I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
c20862 +++$+++ This time it's different. Someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. Five grams of liquid ketamine. It was supposed to be Jo Jo's score.
c20862 +++$+++ Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
c13163 +++$+++ It's what he did.  I'm proud of him.
c13163 +++$+++ They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
c13163 +++$+++ So I quit.
c14998 +++$+++ Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
c14998 +++$+++ Sure.
c14998 +++$+++ What kind of beer would you like?
c14998 +++$+++ Give her Miller's. Miller's High Life.
c24324 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c24324 +++$+++ What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
c24324 +++$+++ Let me explain something...
c24324 +++$+++ Uh, yes.  Yes you did.
c19527 +++$+++ Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
c19527 +++$+++ "Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
c19527 +++$+++ Why not?
c19527 +++$+++ That's right.
c11027 +++$+++ Hungry?
c11027 +++$+++ Just some coffee.
c11027 +++$+++ I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
c11027 +++$+++ Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
c11027 +++$+++ Heart to heart? Woman to woman? Including a casual reference to the part of "Cora" - and your hopes of playing it.
c11027 +++$+++ I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
c11027 +++$+++ Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
c08060 +++$+++ I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
c08060 +++$+++ Mr. Bangs.
c08060 +++$+++ Guys. We're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? Nobody does that in Michigan. Nobody.
c08060 +++$+++ The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
c08060 +++$+++ We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
c04746 +++$+++ A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
c04746 +++$+++ I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
c04746 +++$+++ Please don't shout.
c04746 +++$+++ Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.
c08351 +++$+++ He didn't make it.
c08351 +++$+++ Huh?
c08351 +++$+++ Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
c08351 +++$+++ I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
c08351 +++$+++ I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
c08351 +++$+++ Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
c08351 +++$+++ I dunno. Try tranquilizers. Once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. I'll bring a bagful. It's just the standard tropical kit. But the trick is to get at them.
c24600 +++$+++ That's right.
c24600 +++$+++ Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
c24600 +++$+++ Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
c24600 +++$+++ The people in the town?
c24600 +++$+++ Yes.
c24600 +++$+++ So he was mean?
c24600 +++$+++ No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
c24600 +++$+++ Oh.
c24600 +++$+++ Okay.
c24910 +++$+++ ...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
c24910 +++$+++ So?
c24910 +++$+++ Mm.
c06631 +++$+++ Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
c06631 +++$+++ Yes.
c06631 +++$+++ Are your parents living?
c06631 +++$+++ Why, no.
c06631 +++$+++ Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
c06631 +++$+++ Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
c06631 +++$+++ He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to--
c22097 +++$+++ To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
c22097 +++$+++ I can't kill my own father.
c22097 +++$+++ Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
c22097 +++$+++ Yoda spoke of another.
c22097 +++$+++ The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
c22097 +++$+++ But I have no sister.
c22097 +++$+++ Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
c22097 +++$+++ Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit. But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
c25971 +++$+++ Got it?  Good.  Do not discuss anything over the telephone.  Do not talk to the neighbors.  Stay out of your yard.
c25971 +++$+++ What is he being charged with?
c25971 +++$+++ I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
c25971 +++$+++ That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.
c09175 +++$+++ You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
c09175 +++$+++ We are.
c09175 +++$+++ It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
c09175 +++$+++ Why are you here?
c09175 +++$+++ To accept your surrender. I can clearly destroy you at any time. Lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship.
c09175 +++$+++ And what of the Enterprise?
c09175 +++$+++ I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
c09175 +++$+++ You know that's not possible.
c09175 +++$+++ Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
c09400 +++$+++ This place is dead. I thought this was the city that never sleeps.
c09400 +++$+++ That's New York, baby. You should know that. Look at the waitresses. I'm gonna get me a peg-leg baby.
c09400 +++$+++ They're all skanks.
c09400 +++$+++ Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
c09400 +++$+++ What are you talking about? Look at all the honeys.
c10294 +++$+++ ...Where're we goin'?
c10294 +++$+++ That-a-boy. Hospital.
c10294 +++$+++ Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
c23565 +++$+++ Did he get fresh?
c23565 +++$+++ Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
c23565 +++$+++ And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
c12354 +++$+++ Holy shit, yes!
c12354 +++$+++ Holy shit, yes!
c12354 +++$+++ Holy shit! He said what I said!
c14686 +++$+++ If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
c14686 +++$+++ She shot you down.
c14686 +++$+++ Exactly the opposite.
c14686 +++$+++ So what went wrong?
c14686 +++$+++ I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
c14686 +++$+++ A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified.
c09694 +++$+++ Can't see a thing.
c09694 +++$+++ I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
c09694 +++$+++ But you were coming up anyway, remember?
c09694 +++$+++ I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
c09694 +++$+++ Look, Mr. Brenner...
c23417 +++$+++ Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
c23417 +++$+++ He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
c23417 +++$+++ We've had a real hard life, too, Mama.
c18365 +++$+++ Jesus, Jim!
c18365 +++$+++ Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
c18365 +++$+++ Just be careful.
c18365 +++$+++ You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
c18365 +++$+++ Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
c11542 +++$+++ How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
c11542 +++$+++ Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
c11542 +++$+++ Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
c11542 +++$+++ Look, Buddy-boy -- if there wasn't a lady present, I'd clobber you.
c11691 +++$+++ What the heck are those for?
c11691 +++$+++ No. No. Get Carol.
c11691 +++$+++ I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
c11691 +++$+++ What are you trying to do to me?
c11691 +++$+++ Hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait.  Do it!!!
c23520 +++$+++ You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
c23520 +++$+++ It is.
c23520 +++$+++ Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8.  It would be too large for the deceased's well.
c23520 +++$+++ He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
c23520 +++$+++ It was dead.  We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
c23035 +++$+++ Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
c23035 +++$+++ You never spoke so well of him.
c23035 +++$+++ You lie.
c22334 +++$+++ I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!
c22334 +++$+++ None of us like it!
c22334 +++$+++ Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
c22334 +++$+++ I'm not gonna take --  I'm not gonna take it in stride.  I had a good run turn to shit on me like that -  cleaned me out.
c02497 +++$+++ Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
c02497 +++$+++ I remember that speech really well.
c02497 +++$+++ I had you pegged, didn't I?
c02497 +++$+++ You had the whole human race pegged.
c02497 +++$+++ Probably.
c02497 +++$+++ I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
c02497 +++$+++ I know.
c02497 +++$+++ Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
c09975 +++$+++ We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
c09975 +++$+++ Umm, yes.  She was driving.
c09975 +++$+++ You might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
c16716 +++$+++ How could this be happening?
c16716 +++$+++ I don't know.
c16716 +++$+++ We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
c16716 +++$+++ Sun spot?
c16716 +++$+++ Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
c04400 +++$+++ You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
c04400 +++$+++ I love you.
c04400 +++$+++ Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
c18145 +++$+++ Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
c18145 +++$+++ I couldn't help.
c18145 +++$+++ No, I could not. What do you know about favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
c21156 +++$+++ When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
c21156 +++$+++ I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local-- that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady-- well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out-- we take our cut.
c21156 +++$+++ Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
c21156 +++$+++ We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers--  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
c21156 +++$+++ So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this-- a deal I sweated and bled for-- on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?--
c00994 +++$+++ What are you trying to do to me?
c00994 +++$+++ We want to help...!
c00994 +++$+++ I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
c00994 +++$+++ To you ... ?
c12036 +++$+++ Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
c12036 +++$+++ Really?
c12036 +++$+++ Very well.
c02902 +++$+++ Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
c02902 +++$+++ There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
c02902 +++$+++ No.  That woman wouldn't of said shit if she had a mouthful.
c02902 +++$+++ Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.
c02902 +++$+++ It's not your fault, it's her fault!
c16152 +++$+++ Do you like kids?
c16152 +++$+++ On a case by case basis...
c16152 +++$+++ You know how to make chocolate milk?
c16152 +++$+++ I think I could figure it out.
c16152 +++$+++ Sure.
c09921 +++$+++ And roosters.
c09921 +++$+++ No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
c09921 +++$+++ No, sir --
c09921 +++$+++ Sir --
c06192 +++$+++ The world of our children. How dare they?
c06192 +++$+++ It's war. The weakest suffer the most.
c06192 +++$+++ So are you.
c26443 +++$+++ You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
c26443 +++$+++ Your wife?
c26443 +++$+++ Yeah. See?
c26443 +++$+++ I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
c26443 +++$+++ Yeah, I guess.
c26443 +++$+++ Uh... yeah. Yeah. She's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
c21222 +++$+++ She was?
c21222 +++$+++ As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
c21222 +++$+++ It would seem so, Master.
c25685 +++$+++ No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
c25685 +++$+++ Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
c25685 +++$+++ No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
c25685 +++$+++ The type they marry.
c25685 +++$+++ You know, I'm not the marrying type. I like to take my fun and leave it.
c25685 +++$+++ Nice suit.
c25685 +++$+++ Like it?
c25685 +++$+++ Smart. London, eh?
c25685 +++$+++ I thought so.
c00823 +++$+++ It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
c00823 +++$+++ I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
c00823 +++$+++ Hardly farmers. I've done some checking. All these were in the War. These men know sabotage, tactics, and have four years of bloody fighting experience behind them. They are disciplined, well-trained and have a charismatic leader. If I were to design the perfect outlaw band, this gang is what I would create.
c00823 +++$+++ It's going to be a long winter.
c11677 +++$+++ I was going to do that for you.
c11677 +++$+++ It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
c11677 +++$+++ Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
c02469 +++$+++ Come up to Boston with me?
c02469 +++$+++ Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
c02469 +++$+++ Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
c02469 +++$+++ Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
c25981 +++$+++ About the other night, I'm sorry.
c25981 +++$+++ Me, too.
c25981 +++$+++ I don't know.
c12288 +++$+++ No, thank you. My house has been closed.
c12288 +++$+++ Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
c12288 +++$+++ What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
c19441 +++$+++ Do you know your parents' blood types?
c19441 +++$+++ I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
c19441 +++$+++ Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
c19441 +++$+++ Then why are you here?
c07544 +++$+++ I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
c07544 +++$+++ You didn't think I could just leave you?
c07544 +++$+++ What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
c19285 +++$+++ This girl is a friend of yours?
c19285 +++$+++ Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
c19285 +++$+++ I thought you were married!
c19285 +++$+++ I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
c19285 +++$+++ This girl has a child?
c19285 +++$+++ Tipico.
c15250 +++$+++ Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
c15250 +++$+++ Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
c15250 +++$+++ I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
c15250 +++$+++ That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
c15250 +++$+++ LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
c15250 +++$+++ She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
c15250 +++$+++ Sit down, I have something to tell you.
c15250 +++$+++ Well, I'll tell you what I think. I think she and Principal Collins are embezzling money from the school, and I think they've been doing it for years.
c09671 +++$+++ Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
c09671 +++$+++ What happened?
c09671 +++$+++ Young woman cut herself.
c09671 +++$+++ I don't think it's that serious. You want to sit up here?
c04345 +++$+++ You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
c04345 +++$+++ Packard. Sarah Packard.
c04345 +++$+++ It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
c04345 +++$+++ No, I'm fine.
c04345 +++$+++ You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
c04345 +++$+++ Lots of action. Lots of money.  Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out.
c25302 +++$+++ Whatever, you come recommended. We...
c25302 +++$+++ Recommended?
c25302 +++$+++ Must I speak to you in French?
c25302 +++$+++ Didn't you say I came recommended?  That's what I thought. May I know by whom?
c25302 +++$+++ You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
c25302 +++$+++ Okay. Recommended...
c25302 +++$+++ Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
c25302 +++$+++ What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
c25962 +++$+++ Stop it!
c25962 +++$+++ I've got a present for you...
c25962 +++$+++ In my pocket.
c14396 +++$+++ Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
c14396 +++$+++ He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
c14396 +++$+++ The door was already open...
c14396 +++$+++ We know...  Send the book to evidence...
c14396 +++$+++ She don't want it.
c24473 +++$+++ But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
c24473 +++$+++ Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
c24473 +++$+++ Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
c14533 +++$+++ Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?
c14533 +++$+++ No thank you.
c14533 +++$+++ You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States.
c14533 +++$+++ I'm good.   Really.
c14533 +++$+++ Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
c14533 +++$+++ Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
c14533 +++$+++ -- Super what?
c14533 +++$+++ Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
c14533 +++$+++ Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means.
c14533 +++$+++ I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
c14533 +++$+++ Okay.   How much?
c14533 +++$+++ I'm not here to negotiate.
c14533 +++$+++ Why are you here?
c14533 +++$+++ To tell you that we're interested in the property.
c14533 +++$+++ You told me that on the phone. What the hell are you doing here? Showing off your communication skills? Go back to your people and tell them when they're serious to put a number on the table.
c14533 +++$+++ Yeah -- you do that.
c02598 +++$+++ Can't do it. I cannot do it.
c02598 +++$+++ External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
c02598 +++$+++ Youthful high spirits.
c02951 +++$+++ "Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
c02951 +++$+++ You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
c02951 +++$+++ Yeah.  Me too.
c16838 +++$+++ We must have been heroic.
c16838 +++$+++ Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
c16838 +++$+++ Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
c16838 +++$+++ You know the answer to that.
c16838 +++$+++ I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
c16838 +++$+++ They're only gonna lose.
c16838 +++$+++ The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
c19893 +++$+++ ...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news.  Okay so far?
c19893 +++$+++ Sounds good.
c19893 +++$+++ It's going to be great --
c19893 +++$+++ Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
c10007 +++$+++ I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
c10007 +++$+++ I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
c10007 +++$+++ Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
c10007 +++$+++ I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
c10007 +++$+++ Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
c10007 +++$+++ You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
c10007 +++$+++ I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives!  Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?!  I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
c10007 +++$+++ No, Louise.  How come you never said what happened?
c19032 +++$+++ Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
c19032 +++$+++ I will not approve it.
c19032 +++$+++ And we will begin with tearing it down.
c08997 +++$+++ Most unusual. An unknown form of energy of great intelligence and power. I find it illogical that its intentions are hostile...
c08997 +++$+++ Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
c08997 +++$+++ I liked him better before he died.
c08657 +++$+++ -- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
c08657 +++$+++ Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
c08657 +++$+++ I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
c08657 +++$+++ You plan on driving trucks all your life?
c08657 +++$+++ Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
c10199 +++$+++ Goose is dead.
c10199 +++$+++ True.
c10199 +++$+++ Now?
c10199 +++$+++ Take something off.
c10199 +++$+++ That's up to you.
c05392 +++$+++ He didn't join them. They joined him.
c05392 +++$+++ And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
c05392 +++$+++ Well, at least I'm glad to see you have a sense of humor. That's the first smile I've seen on that gloomy face of your's ...  ... isn't it? It isn't. Oh no. Oh dear. Oh now I've gone and done it.
c25811 +++$+++ Can you read 'em Jack?
c25811 +++$+++ They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds.
c25811 +++$+++ The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
c25811 +++$+++ Better unlock the door.  Sit up, darling, and be dignified.
c10611 +++$+++ Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
c10611 +++$+++ You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
c10611 +++$+++ I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
c10611 +++$+++ Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
c10611 +++$+++ You're scarin' me, baby.
c10611 +++$+++ Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
c10611 +++$+++ You knew my daddy?
c10611 +++$+++ Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
c10611 +++$+++ Oh shit...
c10611 +++$+++ I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
c10611 +++$+++ God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
c10611 +++$+++ I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
c10611 +++$+++ That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
c10611 +++$+++ We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
c10611 +++$+++ Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
c22953 +++$+++ Anything... anything missing or different.
c22953 +++$+++ I don't see anything.
c22953 +++$+++ I can't do this now... please.
c21240 +++$+++ I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
c21240 +++$+++ There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
c21240 +++$+++ Oh, man.
c21240 +++$+++ There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person.  It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean?  There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know?  Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
c21240 +++$+++ I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
c21240 +++$+++ Sounds great.
c27460 +++$+++ Stuart?
c27460 +++$+++ Yes.
c27460 +++$+++ How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
c27460 +++$+++ Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
c27460 +++$+++ Right.  Bombardier, to me please.
c25408 +++$+++ What's happened?
c25408 +++$+++ Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
c25408 +++$+++ They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
c09741 +++$+++ You can't build life like you put together blocks, Toddy.
c09741 +++$+++ What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
c09741 +++$+++ And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
c09741 +++$+++ I am a doctor. I teach medicine.
c09741 +++$+++ Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
c09741 +++$+++ The heart pumps it.
c09741 +++$+++ Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
c09741 +++$+++ The nerve centers -- the brain --
c09741 +++$+++ But what makes a thought start?
c09741 +++$+++ You don't know and you'll never know or understand, Toddy. Not from me or from Knox would you learn those things. Look --
c18173 +++$+++ -- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
c18173 +++$+++ Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
c18173 +++$+++ Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
c18173 +++$+++ Really? Well, let it rip.
c18173 +++$+++ Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
c18173 +++$+++ -- in the act.
c01273 +++$+++ No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
c01273 +++$+++ You're crazy --
c01273 +++$+++ You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
c01273 +++$+++ Get your hands away from the desk!
c24824 +++$+++ What did it smell like?
c24824 +++$+++ It was very specific.
c24824 +++$+++ All right...
c24824 +++$+++ In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  It smelled like that wood.
c24824 +++$+++ So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
c24824 +++$+++ I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
c24824 +++$+++ What happened after you smelled it?
c24824 +++$+++ I looked at Theo.  She had a look on her face.
c24824 +++$+++ Like she smelled it too?
c24824 +++$+++ Yes.
c24824 +++$+++ I got more scared.
c16947 +++$+++ How was that?
c16947 +++$+++ Just fine.
c16947 +++$+++ Where we go in1?
c16947 +++$+++ Why not?
c14559 +++$+++ A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
c14559 +++$+++ Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
c14559 +++$+++ There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
c14559 +++$+++ What the hell is he talking about?
c14559 +++$+++ How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
c02005 +++$+++ To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
c02005 +++$+++ To life.
c02005 +++$+++ Believe me I know.
c07392 +++$+++ Yeah... Sounds like the Constitution to me. With a little of the Bill of Rights thrown in...
c07392 +++$+++ Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
c07392 +++$+++ They are carrying guns. They are threatening police officers. They are undermining the United States of America. And you Inspector Brimmer are not taking your duties seriously...
c16836 +++$+++ Who is it?
c16836 +++$+++ I'm at the door.
c16836 +++$+++ Go way. I'll call a cop.
c16836 +++$+++ Pop, will you let me in?
c16836 +++$+++ Right here. At the door.
c11916 +++$+++ November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
c11916 +++$+++ You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
c11916 +++$+++ Then that's it!
c06709 +++$+++ When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
c06709 +++$+++ That's what I like.
c06709 +++$+++ Which thing?
c06709 +++$+++ Either one.
c06709 +++$+++ Why'd you come to the house the other night?
c06709 +++$+++ I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
c06709 +++$+++ My brother said you were about to fire me.
c06709 +++$+++ That's one way to put it.
c06709 +++$+++ I thought only action movies had villains like that.
c05068 +++$+++ I always suspected the effects might come back. That's why I had to follow you. I had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
c05068 +++$+++ If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
c05068 +++$+++ The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
c05068 +++$+++ Because I can get rid of the demons. I can block the Ladder. I have an antidote. We can kill them off, chemically speaking. They'll all disappear. It's chemistry, my friend. I know. I created it. Come with me. I can help.
c10635 +++$+++ You all right, Professor Tripp?
c10635 +++$+++ He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
c10635 +++$+++ Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
c10635 +++$+++ Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams.
c14620 +++$+++ Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
c14620 +++$+++ Shelly?
c14620 +++$+++ Miss her?
c14620 +++$+++ Kill the men who killed you both, and the Day of the Dead will be your reunion.
c20631 +++$+++ Are you married?
c20631 +++$+++ No, I'm divorced.
c20631 +++$+++ Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
c14631 +++$+++ Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
c14631 +++$+++ It's not really important.
c14631 +++$+++ Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
c14631 +++$+++ Why are you being so dramatic?
c14631 +++$+++ Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
c27305 +++$+++ Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
c27305 +++$+++ Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
c27305 +++$+++ That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even my responses.  We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  -- Thirty seconds.
c05825 +++$+++ Good book, huh?
c05825 +++$+++ Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
c05825 +++$+++ Same one you were reading the other night?
c05825 +++$+++ What night?
c05825 +++$+++ When you didn't come to the club.
c05825 +++$+++ Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
c05825 +++$+++ I called, you know.
c05825 +++$+++ Called? When?
c05825 +++$+++ From the club. You didn't answer.
c05825 +++$+++ You were asleep when I got home, yes.
c07172 +++$+++ What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
c07172 +++$+++ I didn't mean nothin' by it.
c07172 +++$+++ Didn't mean nothin'.
c07172 +++$+++ I guess that passes for manners in your cracker view of things.
c22211 +++$+++ Here's one for the books... a Toon wearin' human clothes.
c22211 +++$+++ Earl... it's me, Valiant.
c22211 +++$+++ Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
c22211 +++$+++ Toon cops worked me over.
c22211 +++$+++ What am I, Earl?
c10918 +++$+++ This is permission to take her apart.
c10918 +++$+++ Where is she?
c10918 +++$+++ Hasn't she had enough?
c10918 +++$+++ My God, but you're determined.
c12852 +++$+++ I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.
c12852 +++$+++ You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
c12852 +++$+++ Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
c12852 +++$+++ I never knew that.
c12852 +++$+++ Nobody did.
c12852 +++$+++ Was this during Betty?
c12852 +++$+++ Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
c12852 +++$+++ Did we want to?
c12852 +++$+++ Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
c12852 +++$+++ What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
c12852 +++$+++ Carolyn!
c12852 +++$+++ -- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
c12852 +++$+++ You're right -- that is sick.
c18311 +++$+++ It is not beautiful.
c18311 +++$+++ You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
c18311 +++$+++ You can't really believe that.
c11581 +++$+++ You came in on that boat, didn't you?
c11581 +++$+++ Yeah --
c11581 +++$+++ Where are you headed?
c11581 +++$+++ What's it matter? Get to the point.
c11581 +++$+++ Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.
c20251 +++$+++ ..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itis over, youire an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youive got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weill go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
c20251 +++$+++ We donit have to, Jim.  Heill come after us.
c20251 +++$+++ Whatis going to make him do that?
c20251 +++$+++ What he didnit get in Prague.  The NOC list.
c20251 +++$+++ Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
c20251 +++$+++ A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
c20251 +++$+++ If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max, Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. Iill have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train.  Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris.
c16492 +++$+++ Will you stand still so I can do this!
c16492 +++$+++ I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
c16492 +++$+++ In a bar called Hellfire.
c16492 +++$+++ Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
c16492 +++$+++ What are the other reasons?
c20129 +++$+++ ...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
c20129 +++$+++ I'm on it.  Don't worry.  Look, Susan...I don't mean to pry, but... I kinda overheard you and Peter.
c20129 +++$+++ Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
c20129 +++$+++ I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
c20129 +++$+++ She used a baster.
c09281 +++$+++ Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
c09281 +++$+++ Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
c09281 +++$+++ No shit.  You got someplace in mind?
c22936 +++$+++ Does this make it with you?
c22936 +++$+++ Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
c22936 +++$+++ You tell me.  I'm new in town.
c22936 +++$+++ He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
c22936 +++$+++ The fingerprints.
c22936 +++$+++ We'll tag along.
c26827 +++$+++ Wilfred.
c26827 +++$+++ ...what have you <u>done</u> to me...
c26827 +++$+++ ...what are we going to do...?
c02556 +++$+++ You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
c02556 +++$+++ I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
c02556 +++$+++ What?
c02556 +++$+++ You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
c02556 +++$+++ Shit, Smith, you're going Biblical on me.
c02556 +++$+++ You're sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
c25327 +++$+++ Okay, shitbag. I'm only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
c25327 +++$+++ Who?  I don't know who the fuck you're talking about, sunshine.
c25327 +++$+++ Gluck.
c25327 +++$+++ Figlio di puttana. You're the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
c25327 +++$+++ Five seconds. Then you die.
c25327 +++$+++ Fuck...
c25327 +++$+++ Gluck's dead, you sonofabitch!
c00978 +++$+++ An evil vet?
c00978 +++$+++ No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
c00978 +++$+++ You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
c26888 +++$+++ Hello, Natalie, you recognize the voice? I'll give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...
c26888 +++$+++ What are you doing here?
c26888 +++$+++ First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't just come barging in here. And what makes you think it's his birthday?
c22017 +++$+++ They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked.
c22017 +++$+++ Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
c22017 +++$+++ Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
c22017 +++$+++ You're not having lunch?
c22017 +++$+++ Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
c07642 +++$+++ No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
c07642 +++$+++ Thank you very much.
c07642 +++$+++ And it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. If you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
c07642 +++$+++ No. Of course not.
c07642 +++$+++ And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
c07642 +++$+++ Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
c07642 +++$+++ Oh sure ... You bet.  Betty ...
c21920 +++$+++ An Institution? A madhouse?  People always call a madhouse "someplace."  Put her in Someplace!
c21920 +++$+++ I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
c21920 +++$+++ What do you mean about caring?  Have you ever seen one of those places? Inside? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  Why? has she harmed you? She's as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
c21920 +++$+++ Well? You meant well?  People always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that...
c22720 +++$+++ What are these?
c22720 +++$+++ They're Bavarian Death style  pretzels.
c22720 +++$+++ No.
c27458 +++$+++ Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
c27458 +++$+++ Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
c27458 +++$+++ One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
c14887 +++$+++ I never thought I'd...
c14887 +++$+++ I know.
c14887 +++$+++ ... Me, too.
c15865 +++$+++ Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
c15865 +++$+++ Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
c15865 +++$+++ Here ... near the Anoat system.
c04946 +++$+++ You said that the last time.
c04946 +++$+++ Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
c04946 +++$+++ Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
c12143 +++$+++ Why do you do that?
c12143 +++$+++ What?
c12143 +++$+++ Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
c12143 +++$+++ You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?
c16327 +++$+++ I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
c16327 +++$+++ Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
c16327 +++$+++ There's no one else here.
c16327 +++$+++ I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
c16327 +++$+++ I'm not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would I, even if I had said information you want, at this juncture be able.
c21227 +++$+++ They are live ones?
c21227 +++$+++ Yes, Master.
c21227 +++$+++ Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
c03281 +++$+++ I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
c03281 +++$+++ So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
c03281 +++$+++ Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
c03281 +++$+++ Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
c03281 +++$+++ Why don't we start with that next week?
c15518 +++$+++ What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  <u>He's one</u> <u>year from his pension</u>.
c15518 +++$+++ It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell?
c15518 +++$+++ He helped me out once.  That's all.
c15518 +++$+++ Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
c15518 +++$+++ Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
c15518 +++$+++ Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself
c15518 +++$+++ <u>What do you want</u>?
c15518 +++$+++ Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn?
c10687 +++$+++ I remember that. Five or six years ago.
c10687 +++$+++ Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
c10687 +++$+++ I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
c11312 +++$+++ Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
c11312 +++$+++ Of course.
c11312 +++$+++ Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
c11312 +++$+++ Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
c11312 +++$+++ Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
c11312 +++$+++ I have a tiny apartment.
c11312 +++$+++ Yeah, I know it's small.
c11312 +++$+++ That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
c11312 +++$+++ All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
c11312 +++$+++ You don't want me to live with you?
c11312 +++$+++ How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
c11312 +++$+++ Mine.
c11312 +++$+++ Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
c11312 +++$+++ No-what, what...? I... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?
c21513 +++$+++ Dr. Zaius --
c21513 +++$+++ Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
c21513 +++$+++ Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
c21513 +++$+++ Certainly, sir. It's a pleasure to see you again.
c21997 +++$+++ Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
c21997 +++$+++ This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
c21997 +++$+++ Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
c21997 +++$+++ Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
c21997 +++$+++ Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
c21997 +++$+++ What did you say, Brother?
c21997 +++$+++ I said ahhh-dam stuff.
c21997 +++$+++ Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff.
c20338 +++$+++ Nu!
c20338 +++$+++ No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
c20338 +++$+++ Ni, ni, ni!
c20338 +++$+++ |      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
c20338 +++$+++ That's it.  Ni!  Ni!
c02584 +++$+++ Captain Miller, you copy?
c02584 +++$+++ I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
c02584 +++$+++ I've found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. We should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it's gonna take some time.
c02584 +++$+++ Understood.
c15175 +++$+++ Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
c15175 +++$+++ Okay, when do I get them?
c15175 +++$+++ At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
c15175 +++$+++ I want to talk to Leon.
c24361 +++$+++ Her own movie theatre.
c24361 +++$+++ I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
c24361 +++$+++ I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
c24361 +++$+++ No.
c24361 +++$+++ All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
c24361 +++$+++ No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
c24361 +++$+++ All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
c24361 +++$+++ Come on, Joe.
c24361 +++$+++ Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
c24361 +++$+++ If you love me, Joe.
c24361 +++$+++ Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
c24361 +++$+++ Nobody asked you to.
c22834 +++$+++ Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
c22834 +++$+++ I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
c22834 +++$+++ Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
c22834 +++$+++ Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
c22834 +++$+++ So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
c22834 +++$+++ A note?
c00759 +++$+++ What did you do with it?
c00759 +++$+++ With what?
c00759 +++$+++ The ten dollars.
c00759 +++$+++ Oh, ten dollars--
c00759 +++$+++ A friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
c06185 +++$+++ Well, it's a sort of wife.
c06185 +++$+++ But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
c06185 +++$+++ In the West, it's one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
c06185 +++$+++ It must be difficult having lots of wives.
c06185 +++$+++ [Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
c04047 +++$+++ When are you going back?
c04047 +++$+++ I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
c04047 +++$+++ What?
c04047 +++$+++ I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
c04047 +++$+++ It'll have to be sex, then.
c08297 +++$+++ Don't do that.
c08297 +++$+++ Why not?
c08297 +++$+++ Because.
c08297 +++$+++ "Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
c08297 +++$+++ I can't tell you like this.
c08297 +++$+++ I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
c08297 +++$+++ I don't care.
c23670 +++$+++ Hi ya, Rebecca...
c23670 +++$+++ Tired.
c23670 +++$+++ Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
c18209 +++$+++ The rain is letting up.
c18209 +++$+++ Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
c18209 +++$+++ I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
c18209 +++$+++ I didn't do anything...God saved her...
c18209 +++$+++ I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
c22443 +++$+++ You OK?
c22443 +++$+++ We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
c22443 +++$+++ Yeah. So why you look do down?
c22443 +++$+++ Not to me. Never to me.
c21287 +++$+++ Detroit.  Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
c21287 +++$+++ Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
c21287 +++$+++ So.  What's your point?
c21287 +++$+++ My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
c21287 +++$+++ Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
c16174 +++$+++ Merry Christmas, Mr. Campbell.
c16174 +++$+++ How'd you do this year, Tony?
c16174 +++$+++ Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
c11170 +++$+++ My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
c11170 +++$+++ Ratfucking.
c11170 +++$+++ In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
c11170 +++$+++ I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
c11170 +++$+++ Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
c11170 +++$+++ Who?--be specific. How high up?
c11170 +++$+++ The slush fund at CREEP financed the ratfucking, we've almost got that nailed down, so--
c25020 +++$+++ And what's that?
c25020 +++$+++ S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
c25020 +++$+++ He just let it explode.
c25020 +++$+++ What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
c25020 +++$+++ No. They put the bomb in the building across the street because it DID have federal offices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. Which is where the bodies were found. But that's the thing...
c26171 +++$+++ Like it?
c26171 +++$+++ Very much. Now, where were we?
c26171 +++$+++ What kinda music do you like?
c26171 +++$+++ Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
c26171 +++$+++ What are your turn-ons?
c26171 +++$+++ Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
c26171 +++$+++ Turn-offs?
c26171 +++$+++ Do you have a fella?
c14371 +++$+++ You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
c14371 +++$+++ She took off with that convertible feller...
c14371 +++$+++ Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
c14371 +++$+++ Yeah.
c14371 +++$+++ I'm leavin' the place to John.
c14371 +++$+++ That's good: he earned it.
c14371 +++$+++ Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
c14371 +++$+++ Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
c18889 +++$+++ I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
c18889 +++$+++ I know.
c18889 +++$+++ You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
c18889 +++$+++ Why would you suppose so?
c18889 +++$+++ One of you must be mistaken.
c10832 +++$+++ Ettore...
c10832 +++$+++ What is it?
c10832 +++$+++ Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
c10832 +++$+++ Yes, yes, of course.
c05742 +++$+++ You know what was in Hell when I came down here, Cassius?
c05742 +++$+++ It's Stanley, sir.
c05742 +++$+++ Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
c05742 +++$+++ What was it called, sir.
c05742 +++$+++ Boogerland!
c05742 +++$+++ I can't enjoy anything. I go fishing. I catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything...
c20683 +++$+++ You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
c20683 +++$+++ You got a real good memory, Star.
c20683 +++$+++ I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
c20683 +++$+++ What do you have to buy?
c20683 +++$+++ Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
c20683 +++$+++ Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
c20683 +++$+++ What?
c20683 +++$+++ Grand Old Opera --
c20683 +++$+++ I know that, Star.
c23485 +++$+++ Here and there. Around.
c23485 +++$+++ Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
c23485 +++$+++ Yeah, that's right.
c23485 +++$+++ Except that there's no bed, is there? And no breakfast either.
c23485 +++$+++ The material world is an illusion. It doesn't matter if they're there or not. The world is in my head.
c23485 +++$+++ But your body is in the world, isn't it?  If someone offered you a place to stay, you wouldn't necessarily refuse, would you?
c23485 +++$+++ People don't do that kind of thing. Not in New York.
c23485 +++$+++ I'm not "people." I'm just me. And I do whatever I goddamn want to do. Got it?
c23485 +++$+++ Thanks, but I'll manage.
c23485 +++$+++ In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
c23485 +++$+++ Suit yourself. But if you change your mind, here's the address.
c15245 +++$+++ Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww.
c15245 +++$+++ She's saying... a beautiful swan...
c15245 +++$+++ ... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
c06247 +++$+++ I'm with a girl, Ralph.
c06247 +++$+++ Get ridda her. This is money inna bank.
c06247 +++$+++ This is a good deal here, Marty.
c21458 +++$+++ But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
c21458 +++$+++ That's correct.
c21458 +++$+++ We were satisfied.
c13978 +++$+++ Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
c13978 +++$+++ So what's that got to do with it?
c13978 +++$+++ What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
c20910 +++$+++ Okay This is okay. Smooth.  Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
c20910 +++$+++ That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
c20910 +++$+++ God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
c20910 +++$+++ You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
c20910 +++$+++ I don't have to say that.
c06072 +++$+++ What's up, man.
c06072 +++$+++ S'up.
c06072 +++$+++ You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
c06072 +++$+++ A little.
c06072 +++$+++ You look good, man.
c06072 +++$+++ Cool.
c10673 +++$+++ Afraid so.
c10673 +++$+++ That's a big book you're writing.
c10673 +++$+++ I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
c10673 +++$+++ Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
c10673 +++$+++ But... ?
c10673 +++$+++ Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
c10673 +++$+++ Washed up?
c10673 +++$+++ Ah. I don't believe in writer's block.
c20539 +++$+++ Hi.
c20539 +++$+++ Come on in!
c20539 +++$+++ That's okay.
c20539 +++$+++ It's just a corpse.
c20539 +++$+++ You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
c14649 +++$+++ Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
c14649 +++$+++ - none taken -
c14649 +++$+++ - wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
c14649 +++$+++ Any ideas who it could be?
c14649 +++$+++ Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
c14649 +++$+++ Where did you say she's from?
c14649 +++$+++ Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
c14649 +++$+++ Greg McConnell.
c14649 +++$+++ The football stud?
c14649 +++$+++ He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
c14649 +++$+++ It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
c14649 +++$+++ I don't think that bothered him.
c14649 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c14649 +++$+++ Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
c14649 +++$+++ Are you shitting me?
c14649 +++$+++ I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know -  "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything."  It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
c14649 +++$+++ Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
c14649 +++$+++ Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
c14649 +++$+++ Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
c14649 +++$+++ Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
c14649 +++$+++ Outstanding.
c14649 +++$+++ No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?
c12971 +++$+++ Gino Marzzone.
c12971 +++$+++ Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
c12971 +++$+++ ...  shit.
c01188 +++$+++ So they can be on TV.
c01188 +++$+++ You sound like the media.
c01188 +++$+++ This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
c01188 +++$+++ Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
c26719 +++$+++ Do you love me?
c26719 +++$+++ Of course.
c26719 +++$+++ How much?
c26719 +++$+++ Kiss me...?
c13175 +++$+++ ...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
c13175 +++$+++ Thanks a lot, Buddy.
c13175 +++$+++ Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
c13175 +++$+++ I see the change in you -- I see it.
c13560 +++$+++ Rachel was terrified when I left her.  I could see it in her eyes.
c13560 +++$+++ She'll be with you soon.  They're pulling up.  They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
c13560 +++$+++ Include me in that.
c15594 +++$+++ What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
c15594 +++$+++ The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
c15594 +++$+++ <u>I</u> know. <u>I</u> know what they're looking for and I'm telling you.
c01263 +++$+++ My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
c01263 +++$+++ Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
c01263 +++$+++ He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
c01263 +++$+++ The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
c24891 +++$+++ What.
c24891 +++$+++ Tell me.
c24891 +++$+++ About Jenny.  Tell me about Jenny.  About the <u>deal</u>.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
c20173 +++$+++ An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
c20173 +++$+++ It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
c20173 +++$+++ When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
c20173 +++$+++ You're still a writer.
c20173 +++$+++ I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
c20173 +++$+++ Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
c20173 +++$+++ Marcia, please.
c20173 +++$+++ No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her.
c20173 +++$+++ Marcia, you know I started "Misery" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever.  For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here.
c20173 +++$+++ Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness?  I'm doing this because I have to.  Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ...  I might just have something that I want on my tombstone.
c06468 +++$+++ Who did this?
c06468 +++$+++ Stu. That was right about the time we met.
c06468 +++$+++ Yeah...before your time.
c01742 +++$+++ In your backyard? How do you protect them?
c01742 +++$+++ It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
c01742 +++$+++ But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
c19389 +++$+++ Hello?
c19389 +++$+++ It's Charlotte.
c19389 +++$+++ Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
c16566 +++$+++ Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
c16566 +++$+++ You mean her.
c16566 +++$+++ What?
c16566 +++$+++ Oh, thanks.
c00205 +++$+++ You'd think the guy'd be smart enough to know he was being tailed.
c00205 +++$+++ Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
c00205 +++$+++ If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
c00205 +++$+++ Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
c02992 +++$+++ You WILL go out there.
c02992 +++$+++ I won't and nothing you say-
c02992 +++$+++ ...Damn you!  Damn you!
c00612 +++$+++ Leave that alone!
c00612 +++$+++ Wolfi!
c00612 +++$+++ Put it down!
c00612 +++$+++ What is this?
c00612 +++$+++ Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
c00612 +++$+++ Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
c00612 +++$+++ What?
c00612 +++$+++ What? The vaudeville, what'd you think?
c00612 +++$+++ Yes.
c00612 +++$+++ Can I see it?
c00612 +++$+++ No.
c00612 +++$+++ Because there's nothing to see.
c07435 +++$+++ Very well, let us move on to...
c07435 +++$+++ Prisoner exchange.
c07435 +++$+++ Sir?
c07435 +++$+++ You have eighteen of my men.  I want them back.
c07435 +++$+++ I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
c07435 +++$+++ What officers?
c26787 +++$+++ Learn anything from Lindenmeyer's file?
c26787 +++$+++ He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight. Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17. All he did day and night was play the violin.
c26787 +++$+++ Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
c17520 +++$+++ Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
c17520 +++$+++ About what?
c17520 +++$+++ Well...  So you tried riding again?
c17520 +++$+++ Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
c17520 +++$+++ Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
c17520 +++$+++ ... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
c17520 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c17520 +++$+++ You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
c17520 +++$+++ Grace, I don't hate your father.
c17520 +++$+++ I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
c17520 +++$+++ Tom?
c09430 +++$+++ I want somebody very good, very safe to plant that gun.  I don't want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his dick in his hand.
c09430 +++$+++ The gun will be there.
c09430 +++$+++ We gotta move...
c23168 +++$+++ Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
c23168 +++$+++ No, man.
c23168 +++$+++ -- Right after I sprayed her?
c23168 +++$+++ She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!
c08499 +++$+++ There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
c08499 +++$+++ I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
c08499 +++$+++ Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
c08499 +++$+++ Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
c08499 +++$+++ You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
c08499 +++$+++ I decide what's right in this jurisdiction. Now move.
c25518 +++$+++ No proof?
c25518 +++$+++ Nothing yet to cinch it.
c25518 +++$+++ Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
c25518 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c25518 +++$+++ For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
c25518 +++$+++ Who's your candidate?
c25518 +++$+++ I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
c25518 +++$+++ They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
c25518 +++$+++ I'll check on that.  I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
c27406 +++$+++ Will you miss me?
c27406 +++$+++ Very....very!
c27406 +++$+++ Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
c27406 +++$+++ Oh, nice.
c27406 +++$+++ I hope you like large weddings.
c27406 +++$+++ Whatever makes you happy.
c27406 +++$+++ I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
c27406 +++$+++ You're incorrigible!
c27406 +++$+++ You bet your boots it does.
c08671 +++$+++ I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
c08671 +++$+++ I ran into complications.
c08671 +++$+++ I hate to say it...
c08671 +++$+++ Then don't.
c08671 +++$+++ -- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
c08671 +++$+++ Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
c08671 +++$+++ Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
c08671 +++$+++ Bandit?
c15493 +++$+++ So... what do you have to tell me?
c15493 +++$+++ Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
c15493 +++$+++ What is it. Tammy?
c15493 +++$+++ I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
c15493 +++$+++ Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
c15493 +++$+++ I did it.
c15493 +++$+++ And when did you do it?
c15493 +++$+++ This weekend.
c15493 +++$+++ Exactly when?
c15493 +++$+++ I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
c15493 +++$+++ And how did you get in the school?
c15493 +++$+++ Door was open.
c15493 +++$+++ Which door?
c15493 +++$+++ I don't know. All I know is I did it I
c15493 +++$+++ I have proof.
c03118 +++$+++ How about this?
c03118 +++$+++ That's not bad.
c03118 +++$+++ That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
c03118 +++$+++ I believe it.
c03118 +++$+++ I turn it on when I confront the guy.
c03118 +++$+++ How do I know that?
c13674 +++$+++ Is it bad?
c13674 +++$+++ No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
c13674 +++$+++ Some kinds of women are...
c07416 +++$+++ What's up with you?
c07416 +++$+++ Nothing.
c07416 +++$+++ Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
c15523 +++$+++ Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
c15523 +++$+++ What was that boyfriend's name?
c15523 +++$+++ We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
c15523 +++$+++ Stens?  Was it Stens?
c15523 +++$+++ Look at a picture for me.
c07660 +++$+++ D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
c07660 +++$+++ ... Yeah.
c07660 +++$+++ That's great.
c01753 +++$+++ I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
c01753 +++$+++ Well, this isn't really a party per se.
c01753 +++$+++ True.
c10387 +++$+++ What are you doing?
c10387 +++$+++ Who am I?
c10387 +++$+++ That's right.
c07021 +++$+++ My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
c07021 +++$+++ Now, Swana...
c07021 +++$+++ First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
c07021 +++$+++ Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard."
c16644 +++$+++ G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
c16644 +++$+++ Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
c16644 +++$+++ Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
c16644 +++$+++ Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
c16644 +++$+++ You're saying you need money.
c16644 +++$+++ Quit crying.  I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...
c05047 +++$+++ What does it say?
c05047 +++$+++ It's gone to the top.
c05047 +++$+++ The numbers stop at 107.
c15820 +++$+++ What's going on in there?
c15820 +++$+++ Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
c15820 +++$+++ Yup.  They must be important, too, cause they came on a special plane.
c08553 +++$+++ -- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
c08553 +++$+++ -- Please, get away from me.
c08553 +++$+++ I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
c08553 +++$+++ You want me to call Security?
c08553 +++$+++ I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
c08553 +++$+++ I have your new leading lady...  ... right here in my pants.
c09034 +++$+++ The whales...?!
c09034 +++$+++ No power to the bay doors.
c09034 +++$+++ The explosive override -- ?
c09034 +++$+++ It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
c09034 +++$+++ Admiral, you'll be trapped!
c17459 +++$+++ All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
c17459 +++$+++ Where have I been?
c17459 +++$+++ More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
c17459 +++$+++ I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
c17459 +++$+++ --Torn down in the name of convenience--
c17459 +++$+++ --and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
c17459 +++$+++ Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
c17459 +++$+++ Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?
c02835 +++$+++ Brother and sister still?
c02835 +++$+++ I wish to be your husband.
c02835 +++$+++ I wish to be your wife.
c02835 +++$+++ Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
c02835 +++$+++ If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
c02835 +++$+++ I will be here when you return.
c24811 +++$+++ Your mother thought he was a good man.  He worked very hard.  What I remember most was his manner was so... slight.  It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
c24811 +++$+++ Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
c24811 +++$+++ No.  What happened... no one expected it.
c24811 +++$+++ Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
c24811 +++$+++ Not much, I think.
c24811 +++$+++ I'm just like him.
c24811 +++$+++ You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
c24811 +++$+++ Nobody worried about your father.
c13316 +++$+++ Don't tell anybody.
c13316 +++$+++ Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
c13316 +++$+++ 247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
c13316 +++$+++ No.  Please.
c27164 +++$+++ That was about as grim as it gets.
c27164 +++$+++ The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
c27164 +++$+++ But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
c15076 +++$+++ Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
c15076 +++$+++ You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
c15076 +++$+++ You've had a lot of bad luck these days. And yet -- it's all so unnecessary. When I think of your opportunities --
c15076 +++$+++ Opportunities?
c15076 +++$+++ Of course. Why man, you have one of the richest farms in the county.  You just go about it the wrong way -- so many men do. Hard work -- well, that's all right for people who don't know how to do anything else. It's all right for people who aren't lucky -- but once you're lucky -- you don't work for other people. You make them work for you.
c15076 +++$+++ A clever man like yourself -- he can find money anywhere. Money to pay his bills -- money for his wife and his children -- money to be a rich man. All he needs is a friend to point it out to him.  Like that!
c10412 +++$+++ I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
c10412 +++$+++ Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
c10412 +++$+++ I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
c10412 +++$+++ I... um...
c09087 +++$+++ This used to be the throttle valve assembly.  It controls the thrust of the engines. It's been completely vaporized... and without it, there's no way to launch the ship.
c09087 +++$+++ Can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
c09087 +++$+++ Yeah... if I knew what it looked like. There's probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
c09087 +++$+++ We're tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.
c27303 +++$+++ Would you like me to stay?
c27303 +++$+++ Mm hmm.
c27303 +++$+++ . . . And just how would you manage that?
c03233 +++$+++ Hello?
c03233 +++$+++ Do you still want to do something tonight?
c03233 +++$+++ What happened to Seymour?
c03233 +++$+++ I can't believe it - he actually scored!
c03233 +++$+++ How repulsive!
c03233 +++$+++ So should I come over?
c03233 +++$+++ Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
c03233 +++$+++ What are you talking about? Who?
c03233 +++$+++ Just some people from work...
c03233 +++$+++ Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.
c18752 +++$+++ Well.
c18752 +++$+++ Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
c18752 +++$+++ Don't worry about it, boss.
c18752 +++$+++ Oh shit.  You said "boss."
c18752 +++$+++ Yeah, I did.
c18752 +++$+++ Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
c18752 +++$+++ No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
c18752 +++$+++ I may not sue.
c24470 +++$+++ Is this blackmail?
c24470 +++$+++ Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
c24470 +++$+++ Is this whitemail?
c24470 +++$+++ What do you want?
c12968 +++$+++ I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
c12968 +++$+++ For what?
c12968 +++$+++ You made a choice once.  Do you think you would make that same choice again?
c12968 +++$+++ If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
c02171 +++$+++ Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
c02171 +++$+++ Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
c02171 +++$+++ I wish I had my board with me now. Even if I could only polish it once in awhile.
c00865 +++$+++ Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
c00865 +++$+++ He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
c00865 +++$+++ Why would I?
c16958 +++$+++ That's not good enough.
c16958 +++$+++ Christ, what...
c16958 +++$+++ Do me a favour. You don't really expect me to fix Kinnear on your say-so?  Just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. Stroll on.
c16958 +++$+++ Jack, you're wrong.
c16958 +++$+++ Jack...
c27182 +++$+++ Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
c27182 +++$+++ Really?
c27182 +++$+++ My... the wild west.
c16106 +++$+++ Big piece or little?
c16106 +++$+++ Huh? Oh, no.
c16106 +++$+++ I'm not much for sweets.
c25122 +++$+++ Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
c25122 +++$+++ Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
c25122 +++$+++ Too difficult?
c25122 +++$+++ Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
c25122 +++$+++ The point is, the modern world is a Jewish disease.
c25122 +++$+++ Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
c02181 +++$+++ You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business...or should I say, not taking care of it.
c02181 +++$+++ What're you talkin' about?
c02181 +++$+++ I'm hired to do a piece of work, my mark goes down and stays down.  Your's makes it to the hospital where you then gotta go finish the job.  Only the cops got the whole thing on video tape.
c02181 +++$+++ That's a lotta crap.
c02181 +++$+++ Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
c02181 +++$+++ I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
c02285 +++$+++ How many times have you seen Frank?
c02285 +++$+++ Four times... so far.
c02285 +++$+++ Can anyone else see him?
c02285 +++$+++ I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
c02285 +++$+++ Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
c02285 +++$+++ I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
c02285 +++$+++ A sign from whom?
c02285 +++$+++ I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
c02285 +++$+++ How does that make you feel?
c02285 +++$+++ It reminded me of my dog Callie.
c02285 +++$+++ Is Callie still around?
c02285 +++$+++ Do you feel alone right now?
c26762 +++$+++ How do you do, Miss Viridiana!
c26762 +++$+++ Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
c26762 +++$+++ You cannot leave ...
c26762 +++$+++ Why not?
c26762 +++$+++ There's been an accident.
c26762 +++$+++ Come with me.
c09416 +++$+++ ...against the computer.
c09416 +++$+++ They're a finesse team...
c09416 +++$+++ Fuck!!! That is so bullshit!
