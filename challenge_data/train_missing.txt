c10476 +++$+++ I warned you Civil Defense people to be ready if you have to evacuate.
c19078 +++$+++ Can I tell them you won't go back in the water?
c16821 +++$+++ Because we're completely mismatched.
c21000 +++$+++ Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
c11479 +++$+++ And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
c08476 +++$+++ No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
c18059 +++$+++ For chrissake, <u>please</u>!  Help me celebrate!  I figured it out!
c04357 +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
c21291 +++$+++ It works.  You should try it sometime.
c00532 +++$+++ But there's no more drug.
c24422 +++$+++ Aren't you forgetting about Selena?
c26050 +++$+++ Fuck you.
c16922 +++$+++ I didn't. I just waited.
c09745 +++$+++ What did you hear?
c20110 +++$+++ Whose?
c00304 +++$+++ Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
c03837 +++$+++ Meet me here today at seven o'clock. With the money. Then we'll go see the film.
c14233 +++$+++ ...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
c18747 +++$+++ Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
c03104 +++$+++ I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
c11282 +++$+++ That movie makes me feel guilty.
c12287 +++$+++ Yes. I am very hungry.
c18072 +++$+++ Okey-doke.
c00233 +++$+++ Five.  On credit.
c02473 +++$+++ Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
c14013 +++$+++ No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
c24969 +++$+++ If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
c19215 +++$+++ Is there no way they can get back to you?
c23970 +++$+++ That's that's that's that's beautiful...
c17396 +++$+++ What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
c16513 +++$+++ Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
c05627 +++$+++ I can promise you complete privacy.
c10565 +++$+++ You heard from Reggie?
c27412 +++$+++ Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
c18353 +++$+++ Mikey Williams?
c20974 +++$+++ No, I didn't.
c13668 +++$+++ She your wife?
c12561 +++$+++ No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
c01873 +++$+++ So how's Tommy?
c11487 +++$+++ Shall we say -- a dollar?
c23628 +++$+++ Your "friend" guaranteed my anonymity.
c23887 +++$+++ You mean they haven't told you yet?
c23186 +++$+++ Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
c16145 +++$+++ -- Yes.
c18098 +++$+++ I think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  Could you find them and see who they belong to?
c18420 +++$+++ Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
c02993 +++$+++ You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
c11386 +++$+++ Just don't fucking tell her.
c06321 +++$+++ No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
c05936 +++$+++ Hard to tell.  I hope not.
c04824 +++$+++ Five G's--or I crab the works.
c21696 +++$+++ Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
c00495 +++$+++ Surely there must be something you can do.
c08424 +++$+++ See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
c04728 +++$+++ Video.
c12674 +++$+++ Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
c25829 +++$+++ This brand.
c22598 +++$+++ Aw, cut it out, Ruth.
c24536 +++$+++ It isn't that I still don't like you, Clark. It's just that...well, once you've had something like that happen to you, it kind of changes a girl.  I'm going to make some coffee. You want some?
c12035 +++$+++ Should there be?
c21689 +++$+++ I say when it's over!
c21697 +++$+++ So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
c04021 +++$+++ There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
c06948 +++$+++ You don't know he did it.
c21429 +++$+++ I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
c09086 +++$+++ I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
c09933 +++$+++ I don't give a shit about your patient!
c24452 +++$+++ But all he had was chocolate milk.
c00529 +++$+++ Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
c09506 +++$+++ I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
c08026 +++$+++ Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
c22111 +++$+++ But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
c08095 +++$+++ Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
c20063 +++$+++ On the phone.
c00677 +++$+++ We had an argument. He's being silly.
c22695 +++$+++ I'll take the whole set.
c23689 +++$+++ What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
c23396 +++$+++ I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
c13816 +++$+++ Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
c20993 +++$+++ What's your name?
c08922 +++$+++ Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
c27040 +++$+++ Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
c08546 +++$+++ Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
c11169 +++$+++ Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
c00718 +++$+++ Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
c21930 +++$+++ It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
c13788 +++$+++ I'm sure you should have failed.
c27436 +++$+++ No, no!  That whole thing!
c03649 +++$+++ Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
c14086 +++$+++ I want to rent a movie.
c18220 +++$+++ Cool.  I read a book once.  It was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  You know, like reincarnation?  It was really good.  You ever read that?
c25544 +++$+++ I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
c21094 +++$+++ So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
c19290 +++$+++ No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
c11974 +++$+++ It's bullshit.  You know it is.
c22667 +++$+++ A half-track, anything.
c12658 +++$+++ You're sure right. It is a strange world.
c24803 +++$+++ Physical?
c05617 +++$+++ Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
c23543 +++$+++ You'd better go fix it.
c18422 +++$+++ Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do it!
c20626 +++$+++ Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
c23634 +++$+++ You want me to let him in?
c05952 +++$+++ If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
c17462 +++$+++ Seven it is.
c26811 +++$+++ Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
c20880 +++$+++ College?
c08614 +++$+++ You're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
c10369 +++$+++ I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
c13272 +++$+++ Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
c16410 +++$+++ I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
c12690 +++$+++ And I only deal with you?
c12461 +++$+++ That's really thoughtful but I--
c07231 +++$+++ You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
c19436 +++$+++ The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
c02676 +++$+++ I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
c25629 +++$+++ Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
c24298 +++$+++ You do not!
c06698 +++$+++ I don't know. I barely made it today.
c22868 +++$+++ But this is life. This isn't a movie.
c00326 +++$+++ No, sir, he is not.
c20948 +++$+++ Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
c16595 +++$+++ Get me on the first shot, if you can.
c02286 +++$+++ Are you embarrassed by these things that you see?
c09864 +++$+++ We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
c12011 +++$+++ How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
c08550 +++$+++ Really?  She didn't mention it.
c08797 +++$+++ You in this with me?
c27117 +++$+++ Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
c25058 +++$+++ ...give a kiss to Edward.
c07734 +++$+++ How's business?
c01657 +++$+++ You like mysteries that much?
c17400 +++$+++ Yes, I do, Will.
c17775 +++$+++ Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
c26678 +++$+++ Calling the ambulance.
c11915 +++$+++ Fine.
c04040 +++$+++ Ray.  I hate Ian.
c22413 +++$+++ No, Carter.  I can't take this.
c24471 +++$+++ Anything.
c27429 +++$+++ Was he any good?
c00067 +++$+++ May I ask by whom?
c26720 +++$+++ We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
c09286 +++$+++ Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
c27068 +++$+++ We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it.
c12827 +++$+++ Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
c07495 +++$+++ I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
c19864 +++$+++ I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
c04921 +++$+++ And Annette's it for you?
c14238 +++$+++ No.  You say you're cool.
c18450 +++$+++ Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
c06836 +++$+++ Alright, I'll remember that.
c24705 +++$+++ Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
c16219 +++$+++ That's good.  That's uh...good.
c14653 +++$+++ Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
c21160 +++$+++ But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
c02403 +++$+++ Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
c19791 +++$+++ Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
c18129 +++$+++ Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
c00801 +++$+++ Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
c20726 +++$+++ Well, there's a couple of girls in Printers Alley if you got any questions. I know I've seen that G- string stuff for sale someplace around.
c17558 +++$+++ Does a horse miss a saddle?
c14028 +++$+++ He knows the first Mrs. Kane socially -  That's the answer we got.
c03804 +++$+++ What's that shade of blue called?
c01832 +++$+++ The crown is that of Scotland. And Scotland is William Wallace.
c17438 +++$+++ An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
c09469 +++$+++ Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
c22646 +++$+++ I thought you'd be happy.
c03107 +++$+++ No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
c17476 +++$+++ But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
c00113 +++$+++ Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
c25625 +++$+++ You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
c07105 +++$+++ Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
c25241 +++$+++ You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
c14525 +++$+++ You didn't have to kill Sophie.
c11114 +++$+++ With gestures, of course.
c23221 +++$+++ Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
c07070 +++$+++ No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
c20191 +++$+++ Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
c13245 +++$+++ Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
c02817 +++$+++ And you accused her of tampering with your mail.
c13785 +++$+++ Why?
c10326 +++$+++ -- alleged crime --
c00894 +++$+++ You don't wanna move, do you?
c10173 +++$+++ Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
c19630 +++$+++ No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
c06649 +++$+++ Ja.
c09515 +++$+++ Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
c15055 +++$+++ You never want to find out.
c08436 +++$+++ So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
c18389 +++$+++ Did she?
c26195 +++$+++ Good for you.
c23178 +++$+++ How?
c02370 +++$+++ But -
c16057 +++$+++ It's orange!
c24088 +++$+++ Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
c19816 +++$+++ I just thought... you were a guy.
c14178 +++$+++ Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
c16705 +++$+++ Uh, huh.
c24606 +++$+++ Why are you calling me, Zoe?
c04360 +++$+++ Tell her what?
c23656 +++$+++ Can I go when the holiday comes?
c08098 +++$+++ Nope.
c15563 +++$+++ Right now, before I back down.
c13203 +++$+++ I knew what you meant.
c21305 +++$+++ You a lawyer?
c19958 +++$+++ When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
c09574 +++$+++ That's a nice name.
c17325 +++$+++ Why didn't you yoke him?
c17285 +++$+++ Not --
c00570 +++$+++ I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
c03117 +++$+++ Wait. How about this?
c02988 +++$+++ Just don't.
c14109 +++$+++ Here. Now leave me alone.
c23042 +++$+++ But why me?
c26902 +++$+++ I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
c06722 +++$+++ Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
c07510 +++$+++ Please.
c16579 +++$+++ I guess not.
c15336 +++$+++ Don't you have any savings?
c19552 +++$+++ Great, bye.
c15831 +++$+++ What?  Beth?  My Beth?
c13222 +++$+++ Don't ask.
c17055 +++$+++ Yes.
c20939 +++$+++ He's full of shit.
c23575 +++$+++ But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
c15837 +++$+++ Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
c02867 +++$+++ What is your purpose in Mexico?
c14354 +++$+++ I don't follow.
c23556 +++$+++ Isn't that ridiculous?
c01293 +++$+++ No one else heard it?
c09603 +++$+++ Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
c19880 +++$+++ And that?
c11623 +++$+++ And you could just tell when the supplies were booby trapped?
c07089 +++$+++ Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
c15944 +++$+++ Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
c14267 +++$+++ So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
c04484 +++$+++ I came here to save you.
c12806 +++$+++ No!  Why would I want to kill him?
c11941 +++$+++ What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
c07013 +++$+++ Now, Ninotchka... please!
c17953 +++$+++ We're gonna feature Gale's cast more.  The trick is gonna be keeping the upper hand on this piece. As long as we have Gale and there's no mystery guy, we're the center of the story.  But if he shows up and somebody else gets him first or exclusive...
c16589 +++$+++ What?
c09147 +++$+++ How can you be sure?
c21006 +++$+++ Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
c08178 +++$+++ My child you are the only survivor.
c06422 +++$+++ Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
c18911 +++$+++ I can't imagine you crying.
c24979 +++$+++ The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
c01515 +++$+++ Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
c17620 +++$+++ Do you?
c08995 +++$+++ That's crazy!
c05490 +++$+++ Huh?
c06891 +++$+++ Oh, Jesus ...
c05955 +++$+++ You can't run --
c00606 +++$+++ No one calls you that.
c19962 +++$+++ The 'question' --
c21884 +++$+++ Someone is sitting in that window.
c20036 +++$+++ Oh, yeah...
c07863 +++$+++ And where you goin'?
c19895 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c09384 +++$+++ Sounds more like Aids...
c09909 +++$+++ I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
c14301 +++$+++ Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
c22298 +++$+++ Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
c26016 +++$+++ The West End.  We buy it off the streets.  I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different --
c16530 +++$+++ Is he?
c18598 +++$+++ You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
c24669 +++$+++ But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
c21289 +++$+++ You know who they are?
c04961 +++$+++ Oh, wait, you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it?
c04899 +++$+++ That's not what they're tellin' me.
c18444 +++$+++ Wait...Did you say off-season?
c08050 +++$+++ We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
c12359 +++$+++ Glooph is not a letter, sir.
c16269 +++$+++ Yah, got a front movin' in.
c04316 +++$+++ And I think I'm going to.
c23547 +++$+++ That's right.
c23069 +++$+++ And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
c02326 +++$+++ Okay?
c06357 +++$+++ What's the suspect's name?
c23788 +++$+++ No. Do You?
c12822 +++$+++ He was only doing what he thought was right.
c17481 +++$+++ One cannot love and kill.
c25326 +++$+++ Then why don't you reach him?
c16167 +++$+++ Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of 'em take a couple seconds...  ...some of 'em take a lot longer...
c05599 +++$+++ He jumped into the ocean.
c11200 +++$+++ ...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
c22490 +++$+++ Yes, I did.
c01147 +++$+++ My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
c13168 +++$+++ Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
c00303 +++$+++ So, you have a wife and kid waiting for you in Pennsylvania... what are you doing mixed up in all this?
c25608 +++$+++ The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here.
c04096 +++$+++ You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
c17099 +++$+++ Eight units.  Mountain View.
c23998 +++$+++ Well, then, what's he doing here?
c03344 +++$+++ Are you all right?  You coming down with something?
c22765 +++$+++ What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
c08864 +++$+++ That's what I wanna hear.
c15363 +++$+++ The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
c14066 +++$+++ She's in here?
c22162 +++$+++ Ya still light seventy.
c03955 +++$+++ Not know.
c08327 +++$+++ Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
c15289 +++$+++ It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
c08055 +++$+++ What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
c14482 +++$+++ What if it's got a pattern?
c25070 +++$+++ Yes.
c04365 +++$+++ Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
c12430 +++$+++ Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
c03791 +++$+++ We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
c09210 +++$+++ No.
c17624 +++$+++ All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
c12502 +++$+++ Fuckin' A.
c19159 +++$+++ No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
c16704 +++$+++ Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
c16568 +++$+++ You're lucky.
c08489 +++$+++ It's not going to be easy.
c05304 +++$+++ I've figured out the message.
c09717 +++$+++ Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
c21811 +++$+++ Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
c11337 +++$+++ I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my...
c19464 +++$+++ I don't wanna see that.
c05011 +++$+++ Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
c15096 +++$+++ Mary! Come back ...
c15806 +++$+++ I was just asking.  Are you all right?
c02935 +++$+++ Then I suggest we start there.
c16545 +++$+++ God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
c08477 +++$+++ McKendrick's men got him.
c06524 +++$+++ You said it!
c00643 +++$+++ Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
c00128 +++$+++ And what do you do with the bones?
c18511 +++$+++ Aw, get going!
c18091 +++$+++ No.  He said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
c24809 +++$+++ No, thank you.  Goodnight.
c17104 +++$+++ The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
c04646 +++$+++ Johnson & Johnson. Union Carbide in Japan. I was general manager and director of new products. I speak Japanese. I was a director of corporate development at Pfizer. All health-related.  What else? Outside the "zone"...?
c00499 +++$+++ All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
c01045 +++$+++ Oh, those. Why do you ask?
c22747 +++$+++ Just her name.
c09276 +++$+++ Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
c08836 +++$+++ Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
c04220 +++$+++ What's from the Governor?
c26041 +++$+++ No, I'm clean.
c25473 +++$+++ Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
c23464 +++$+++ Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
c16278 +++$+++ What... What is it all about?
c20762 +++$+++ They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
c24402 +++$+++ What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
c25541 +++$+++ I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted -
c02517 +++$+++ Very cool. Trippy.
c07891 +++$+++ Sure, what else is new?
c05063 +++$+++ Where have they gone?
c21478 +++$+++ I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
c25566 +++$+++ Yes.
c00756 +++$+++ Absolutely.
c24389 +++$+++ No, you're not.  Max! Max!
c07559 +++$+++ My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
c17262 +++$+++ You hear me?
c14618 +++$+++ I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
c01964 +++$+++ Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
c01528 +++$+++ You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
c24528 +++$+++ Thank you.
c18689 +++$+++ Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
c05918 +++$+++ You think that's what's-happening?
c08413 +++$+++ What?
c23262 +++$+++ Stay away...!
c25876 +++$+++ Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
c01820 +++$+++ That's a lie!
c21199 +++$+++ Really?
c20698 +++$+++ How in the world did he get shot?
c18597 +++$+++ They just wanted to say hello.
c19723 +++$+++ Absolutely,
c19658 +++$+++ What is that?
c12083 +++$+++ Silent night, violent night...
c08097 +++$+++ Don't ask me that.
c26671 +++$+++ I didn't hear you.
c01601 +++$+++ It must be great.
c25774 +++$+++ Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
c18627 +++$+++ I don't know, it depends.
c09261 +++$+++ What stuff?
c21849 +++$+++ Oh, no.  No.  No.  I meant no scheme.  I merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  It's just a thought.
c20725 +++$+++ Eight-thirty in the chapel.
c20183 +++$+++ I knew where it was.
c00466 +++$+++ We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
c04985 +++$+++ She believed you?
c19319 +++$+++ What was your father's name?
c07619 +++$+++ Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.
c21872 +++$+++ Ta.  Ta.
c22884 +++$+++ He's not a suspect, is he?
c26544 +++$+++ I...
c13352 +++$+++ Well, I'd rather not say.
c11700 +++$+++ You're a wonderful man. Two o'clock is a good time. Here's the key in case he's asleep. Open the curtains for him, so he sees God's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
c10585 +++$+++ That don't seem fair.
c26363 +++$+++ Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
c13140 +++$+++ Okay.
c18743 +++$+++ You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
c08605 +++$+++ Chicken blood on the crops.
c01003 +++$+++ Any other vices?
c00411 +++$+++ Alright. I'll think about it.
c00284 +++$+++ They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
c15323 +++$+++ Ah, so I pull the strings!
c10118 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c20829 +++$+++ Let's stay here, Will.
c15407 +++$+++ Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
c10783 +++$+++ Depraved? My mistake.
c01597 +++$+++ I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
c25776 +++$+++ Change?
c02279 +++$+++ So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
c00123 +++$+++ Answer it.
c01403 +++$+++ I said... STOP!
c07996 +++$+++ Won't mother be proud.
c07600 +++$+++ No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
c14888 +++$+++ Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
c04109 +++$+++ You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
c24455 +++$+++ Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
c18681 +++$+++ Funny, Jake...Funny.
c22923 +++$+++ What?  What?
c11926 +++$+++ Oh, my.
c26807 +++$+++ ...where?
c23280 +++$+++ What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
c05657 +++$+++ You got any weed?
c11818 +++$+++ No problem, is it at your place?
c06045 +++$+++ It's not even yours.
c19371 +++$+++ Oh yeah?
c23225 +++$+++ No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
c11860 +++$+++ Like what, sir?
c00707 +++$+++ Oh.
c19612 +++$+++ I don't know what I've done.
c23741 +++$+++ So I've been told.
c10489 +++$+++ Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
c22907 +++$+++ Which is you...
c11870 +++$+++ Oh yeah.
c13579 +++$+++ You're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
c19813 +++$+++ I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
c25376 +++$+++ Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
c11390 +++$+++ Anymore.
c25006 +++$+++ It looks so small.
c12375 +++$+++ Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
c12317 +++$+++ I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
c07191 +++$+++ Then you'll like me.
c00096 +++$+++ Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
c05446 +++$+++ Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
c18286 +++$+++ But, sir! --
c13861 +++$+++ And what if it does?
c25292 +++$+++ ...On holiday?
c11944 +++$+++ But... I thought no one cared about this picture.
c05398 +++$+++ It is the time.
c02804 +++$+++ You got it.
c12951 +++$+++ Another time.
c08531 +++$+++ Simone does not control my destiny.
c19837 +++$+++ Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
c15991 +++$+++ Vacation?  Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
c15896 +++$+++ No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
c18624 +++$+++ We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
c15890 +++$+++ Give it.
c16990 +++$+++ No. Really, I am.
c25823 +++$+++ Then why did you run away?
c02946 +++$+++ I saw an article...
c20986 +++$+++ I don't know what happened.
c24195 +++$+++ How much soda, sir.
c16176 +++$+++ Jack...don't even start...
c00087 +++$+++ Out on my back when I was a small boy.
c21135 +++$+++ A little bad luck?
c14414 +++$+++ This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
c01246 +++$+++ One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
c04434 +++$+++ We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
c10615 +++$+++ Yeah?
c00996 +++$+++ 'Our revels now are ended.'
c11089 +++$+++ Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
c10363 +++$+++ Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
c25080 +++$+++ They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt, as soon as they've been examined.
c06431 +++$+++ Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
c24763 +++$+++ I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
c12692 +++$+++ What's that?
c26007 +++$+++ A place we have, that we know is protected.
c14450 +++$+++ You're not envious?
c03402 +++$+++ On your honor as a Roman officer, daddy?
c01967 +++$+++ Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
c21432 +++$+++ Rayisha.
c06570 +++$+++ Then you *did* say it.
c14005 +++$+++ You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
c11331 +++$+++ I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
c14025 +++$+++ Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York.  It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth.
c05605 +++$+++ You'd hate him for the trick.
c26354 +++$+++ Sweet Grace?  What about her?
c22585 +++$+++ Now don't start talking against the union again.
c15601 +++$+++ For that matter, I think you will too.
c23391 +++$+++ Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
c14377 +++$+++ Well, whatta we got here?
c01389 +++$+++ Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
c16406 +++$+++ Thank you.  Thank you, sir...
c04495 +++$+++ It's a new experience for me.
c04980 +++$+++ Are you serious?
c16214 +++$+++ Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
c16775 +++$+++ Get up!
c20839 +++$+++ Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
c23765 +++$+++ Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
c20334 +++$+++ You're a looney.
c01777 +++$+++ He said you ran away from home.
c00013 +++$+++ What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
c18360 +++$+++ Forget what?
c09559 +++$+++ But this is a porno movie.
c18378 +++$+++ What are you doing at home on a Friday night?
c07992 +++$+++ They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
c10142 +++$+++ A murder. On the reservation.
c04828 +++$+++ Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
c24375 +++$+++ It is to me.  That's why I came to this house.  That's why I took this job -- ghost writing!
c08648 +++$+++ When one sees you they all see you.
c02496 +++$+++ Okay.
c26055 +++$+++ No, I don't think so.
c06817 +++$+++ She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
c21477 +++$+++ Then where is he? He's not in the hole. We looked.
c26874 +++$+++ ...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
c20353 +++$+++ Farewell, Concorde!
c22497 +++$+++ ... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
c24227 +++$+++ I asked you a question, Lothar!
c05165 +++$+++ We definitely want it to have junk.
c13810 +++$+++ I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
c04382 +++$+++ Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
c25642 +++$+++ I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
c03129 +++$+++ Sounds fair.
c20405 +++$+++ Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
c25906 +++$+++ How come you're not wearing my shoes?
c19915 +++$+++ I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
c26943 +++$+++ Who's that?
c10202 +++$+++ I live here, remember?
c25431 +++$+++ No, words. You have never heard words?
c12331 +++$+++ Thank you, Colonel.
c14950 +++$+++ I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
c17934 +++$+++ We're all assholes, Bernie?
c02647 +++$+++ You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
c24228 +++$+++ Well, it would probably help if you took it ...sort of...straight down.
c09493 +++$+++ Freddie?
c03340 +++$+++ Who?  Just -- someone we know.
c12558 +++$+++ I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
c03976 +++$+++ No personal details?
c22130 +++$+++ ...Guess.
c06815 +++$+++ Yes, of course, I would.  You know I am not one of your wife's greatest admirers, but I certainly know nothing about this.
c23817 +++$+++ But sir --
c01837 +++$+++ When will his trial be?
c11789 +++$+++ You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
c26976 +++$+++ He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
c10325 +++$+++ -- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
c05624 +++$+++ You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
c11039 +++$+++ That's not true!
c05803 +++$+++ In pornos?
c03605 +++$+++ His blood pressure is under a hundred. I don't think he'll live to get to the hospital.
c19867 +++$+++ Put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
c16540 +++$+++ You better hold onto your tongue!
c27419 +++$+++ But, sir...
c12393 +++$+++ But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
c22032 +++$+++ No, sir.
c19733 +++$+++ No.
c07861 +++$+++ What?
c18962 +++$+++ I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
c00332 +++$+++ Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
c06612 +++$+++ I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
c20206 +++$+++ Very.
c22658 +++$+++ I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
c02957 +++$+++ I think you look beautiful.
c18960 +++$+++ Thank you. Goodbye, John.
c11895 +++$+++ Then why'd you do it?
c25260 +++$+++ Perhaps it wasn't so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
c09359 +++$+++ He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
c00735 +++$+++ That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
c23277 +++$+++ Yeah... sure.
c06876 +++$+++ It's the last chance they have for me to kill you. Try to get out of it. They won't let you. They can't. Try to change the schedule and you'll know I'm right. What have you got to lose? It comes down to who you trust, them or me? Test them.
c22985 +++$+++ I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
c03945 +++$+++ It's important.
c12389 +++$+++ But now we've lost access to Craig.
c15755 +++$+++ You can't be too careful.
c00414 +++$+++ I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
c06544 +++$+++ I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
c09990 +++$+++ I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
c07580 +++$+++ Yeah?
c01730 +++$+++ We all set?
c11273 +++$+++ This guy's on television.
c13545 +++$+++ They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
c16393 +++$+++ Fuck you.
c23789 +++$+++ Do I want you?
c05714 +++$+++ How about some steak sauce?
c27418 +++$+++ But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
c14189 +++$+++ Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
c23134 +++$+++ Like what?
c16274 +++$+++ What's the next step here, Jerry?
c25699 +++$+++ No, thank you.
c06814 +++$+++ Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
c03293 +++$+++ -well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
c23041 +++$+++ I have spoken with your father.
c10740 +++$+++ The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
c00470 +++$+++ Now!
c18257 +++$+++ Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
c08319 +++$+++ I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
c07905 +++$+++ Ever get an answer?
c23858 +++$+++ Beth --
c16982 +++$+++ Did you work with him, Keith?
c02292 +++$+++ It's too late. I've already ruined my life.
c11911 +++$+++ Yes.
c26595 +++$+++ You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
c27384 +++$+++ He takes himself seriously.
c23021 +++$+++ "Madam!"
c21175 +++$+++ A dive? You mean, into the water?
c01280 +++$+++ He's telling the truth, up to a point.
c18152 +++$+++ A Volkswagen.
c10120 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c02589 +++$+++ "...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
c11764 +++$+++ I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
c01339 +++$+++ You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
c24655 +++$+++ You're sure.  Find out for me.
c14845 +++$+++ Don't say a .
c11785 +++$+++ So why didn't we?
c19226 +++$+++ I think you'll find it is in your interest.
c26042 +++$+++ My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
c14923 +++$+++ Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
c04090 +++$+++ I hope I never get that old.
c12751 +++$+++ You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
c17867 +++$+++ Let's kick his ass.
c27426 +++$+++ What?
c09775 +++$+++ Yes, sir -- it certainly does!
c17990 +++$+++ His secretary just confirmed.
c05707 +++$+++ We'd be in the hole by now. Hey, man, you're peeing on my shoe.
c22348 +++$+++ Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
c18137 +++$+++ He will be here.
c08626 +++$+++ Yes!
c14752 +++$+++ Does she have PMS?
c15560 +++$+++ Why not?
c08885 +++$+++ Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
c03190 +++$+++ Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
c09362 +++$+++ Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
c12252 +++$+++ <u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
c03194 +++$+++ I...
c10868 +++$+++ As much as Mother Miriam does?
c02670 +++$+++ Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
c27110 +++$+++ Like what?
c02428 +++$+++ Yes -- I believe you do.
c08853 +++$+++ Ever try forty sleeping pills?
c24067 +++$+++ You don't like his friends.
c23495 +++$+++ Yeah, it might be.
c08696 +++$+++ I'm not doing cocaine.
c21909 +++$+++ What?
c02609 +++$+++ What? No. I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
c02135 +++$+++ Don't worry, I won't report you!
c14797 +++$+++ What are they for?
c04310 +++$+++ Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
c20075 +++$+++ If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
c07844 +++$+++ As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
c23692 +++$+++ What do you mean?! I could leave him if I wanted to!
c23776 +++$+++ What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
c05122 +++$+++ It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
c00030 +++$+++ Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
c24322 +++$+++ I know, but that was before.
c04555 +++$+++ Joe! It's 56 hours!
c22980 +++$+++ But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
c12050 +++$+++ What's that?
c24700 +++$+++ Major, show me someone who hasn't made an anti-Semitic remark and I'll show you the gates of paradise.
c25743 +++$+++ Is he your boyfriend?
c26352 +++$+++ Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
c14064 +++$+++ The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.
c05301 +++$+++ I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.  Not that you're playing it very well.
c16741 +++$+++ Fuck you, asshole.
c08302 +++$+++ If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
c23636 +++$+++ Thank you, Miss Johnson.
c08736 +++$+++ Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
c19561 +++$+++ I can check on that for you, maybe we can take a tour --
c20415 +++$+++ Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
c09928 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c20528 +++$+++ Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
c14922 +++$+++ Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
c07486 +++$+++ That would hardly be proper.
c08953 +++$+++ And who am I hiding from?
c09311 +++$+++ Another what?
c07854 +++$+++ I told you! Where? Grauman's? El Capitan? Or did Radio City come crawling back?
c06085 +++$+++ Yeah.
c08483 +++$+++ Well, they're wrong. This territory is full of bad characters.
c23182 +++$+++ They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
c19383 +++$+++ Not true.
c09104 +++$+++ And if they succeed, humans won't make First Contact with the Vulcans tomorrow.  As First Officer I should be the one beaming down...
c07912 +++$+++ I only have a hundred dollars or so.
c02778 +++$+++ Calm down, Frances.
c17647 +++$+++ No...
c13065 +++$+++ I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
c13033 +++$+++ Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
c04217 +++$+++ I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
c04849 +++$+++ Why?  What's wrong?
c04402 +++$+++ Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
c13516 +++$+++ I am. Dinner with Brock Leviathan...
c11363 +++$+++ There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
c19783 +++$+++ I stopped drinking.  I gave up drugs.  And I'm meditating three hours a day.  It's the center of my life...
c02895 +++$+++ He comes in here every day and we bullshit. He's used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he'd know something was up.
c00355 +++$+++ What could be worse than disappoint- ing a little girl?
c13126 +++$+++ What's the reason? Give me a reason, Tom.
c25303 +++$+++ He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
c21210 +++$+++ I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
c01433 +++$+++ It's Ichiro.  Ich.
c26905 +++$+++ Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
c02094 +++$+++ That's it?
c05084 +++$+++ I don't know. I don't know.
c25798 +++$+++ It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
c05119 +++$+++ He ate a car?
c07964 +++$+++ He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
c01807 +++$+++ It's just a nightmare.
c15662 +++$+++ There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
c20412 +++$+++ Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
c23202 +++$+++ ... this doing hair it's...
c05869 +++$+++ The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
c21204 +++$+++ Forty-five bills.
c06947 +++$+++ Meanwhile...?
c03312 +++$+++ I won't.
c17763 +++$+++ I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
c27000 +++$+++ Don't think so.
c26607 +++$+++ It's not my line.
c24755 +++$+++ Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
c08588 +++$+++ I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  They don't have meetings about rainbows.
c25055 +++$+++ Yes mother.
c06846 +++$+++ Why?
c27099 +++$+++ I got an anonymous tip and an address in Cincinnati.
c07666 +++$+++ Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
c05213 +++$+++ Yeah.
c14370 +++$+++ No.
c19912 +++$+++ What?
c20873 +++$+++ I'll be okay.
c18045 +++$+++ I'll no forget you.
c18272 +++$+++ Sez who?
c12270 +++$+++ Fine. He's very nice.
c06842 +++$+++ They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
c07875 +++$+++ Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
c03365 +++$+++ Janine, I'm sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
c11088 +++$+++ I won't forget.
c03934 +++$+++ I like that...
c05549 +++$+++ Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
c03330 +++$+++ Then why have you come?
c02117 +++$+++ Don't let yourself down.
c06607 +++$+++ A girl?
c11472 +++$+++ Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
c18605 +++$+++ Recovering nicely.
c03518 +++$+++ HUH?
c27053 +++$+++ Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
c13283 +++$+++ Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
c12515 +++$+++ Any casualties?
c08374 +++$+++ Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
c14012 +++$+++ "Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
c20697 +++$+++ Not yet.
c21529 +++$+++ Taylor.	I'm telling you --
c11270 +++$+++ I did no such thing!
c12517 +++$+++ Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
c12785 +++$+++ -- And what did you suggest?
c02799 +++$+++ Did you expect him to look you up?
c10064 +++$+++ Are you... an architect?
c19390 +++$+++ How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
c19377 +++$+++ I don't know.
c10275 +++$+++ What do <u>you</u> use it for?
c07793 +++$+++ -- words alone are insufficient.
c04245 +++$+++ You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
c20859 +++$+++ What are you talkin' about?
c00432 +++$+++ A hunting accident is perfect.
c13323 +++$+++ Yeah...you a witch?
c21401 +++$+++ You look exactly the same.
c00023 +++$+++ Will Bogey get bent?
c15623 +++$+++ Yes.
c02546 +++$+++ I think she's disappointed that I'm not more, ah, sort of atavistic. She's got some naive, sentimental notions about Indians. I'm sure she liked me, though; but.... then she left town.
c14020 +++$+++ I'd like to talk to you about that.
c08410 +++$+++ If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
c00832 +++$+++ Isn't that special?  Patrick?
c27446 +++$+++ Yes!
c06703 +++$+++ No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
c24554 +++$+++ There are none of them any good anyway.
c21369 +++$+++ What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
c20393 +++$+++ There are important papers from --
c14006 +++$+++ I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
c16251 +++$+++ I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
c15182 +++$+++ Will you speak the fucking English language? The poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  The boy speaks English, you know. Reads, writes, I swear it. He does this when he's around girls. Thinks it's cute.
c03415 +++$+++ Are you going to graduate school?
c16088 +++$+++ Like a baby. You?
c03046 +++$+++ The British army, sir!
c25165 +++$+++ Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
c02158 +++$+++ This is fun.
c10526 +++$+++ It says she was originally Schooner rigged, but Captain Sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  I think square rigs look so much more romantic.
c12229 +++$+++ But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
c17484 +++$+++ Good. What else? Anything interesting?
c15631 +++$+++ We'd rather not--
c21807 +++$+++ But you don't know where he is.
c01183 +++$+++ How so?
c18002 +++$+++ My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
c04722 +++$+++ ...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
c04202 +++$+++ Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
c09113 +++$+++ What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
c06701 +++$+++ No.
c22464 +++$+++ See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
c15801 +++$+++ You think there's more?
c24619 +++$+++ About eight-thirty in the morning.
c00566 +++$+++ You have leave to try.
c13597 +++$+++ He gave me a look.
c18544 +++$+++ It's still there!
c06240 +++$+++ Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
c26818 +++$+++ Waal, that's where you <u>want</u> em...
c02948 +++$+++ No shortage of suspects.
c13908 +++$+++ It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
c14803 +++$+++ You know, I've never seen your cat.
c13608 +++$+++ You on the game?
c10662 +++$+++ She likes old movies like I do, that's all.  Besides, she doesn't really know me. She thinks she does, but she doesn't. Maybe it's because she's Mormon and I'm Catholic.
c03306 +++$+++ I do, actually; very much.
c04540 +++$+++ I'll be out of touch for a while. Just get to the airport.
c08618 +++$+++ Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
c24789 +++$+++ Like a stroke?
c05102 +++$+++ I missed you too.
c14170 +++$+++ Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
c15874 +++$+++ Thanks.
c26455 +++$+++ What?
c08821 +++$+++ What if you get hurt?
c12111 +++$+++ There was nothing I could do.  Batman deactivated her.  She's dead.
c24567 +++$+++ She's in trouble?
c09272 +++$+++ Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
c02404 +++$+++ Oh, no do not say that. You have been so kind to me. I was afraid to say too much. People always want me to be quiet. You wanted me to speak, but I was afraid. Forgive me.
c11587 +++$+++ Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.
c01649 +++$+++ Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
c19530 +++$+++ I just told you.
c08171 +++$+++ Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
c26806 +++$+++ What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
c00831 +++$+++ I never knew you smoked.
c10591 +++$+++ You mean like pedal pushers?
c00762 +++$+++ Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
c20864 +++$+++ What's my end?
c04548 +++$+++ Which language?
c27327 +++$+++ Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.
c02239 +++$+++ Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
c16811 +++$+++ I'm not ready.
c13341 +++$+++ No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
c19501 +++$+++ I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
c19197 +++$+++ A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
c06423 +++$+++ Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
c21498 +++$+++ You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
c06940 +++$+++ What you been up to?
c17613 +++$+++ I don't want to.
c22592 +++$+++ I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
c07965 +++$+++ Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
c04224 +++$+++ No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
c20238 +++$+++ I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
c01652 +++$+++ What did you see?
c22929 +++$+++ I realize that.
c07024 +++$+++ Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open!
c20754 +++$+++ Says the United States of America.
c15347 +++$+++ Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
c09800 +++$+++ You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
c08887 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c16680 +++$+++ We must follow it.
c02316 +++$+++ C'mere. I love you so much.
c05802 +++$+++ We should stop seeing each other.
c08480 +++$+++ You must have known that before you came.
c03082 +++$+++ Who?
c03674 +++$+++ My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
c03911 +++$+++ Nonsense, I...
c16065 +++$+++ Smells like tuna number two to me.
c18031 +++$+++ --the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
c24873 +++$+++ Honest.  Didn't know where to look till I was 21.
c10242 +++$+++ That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
c15647 +++$+++ There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
c15039 +++$+++ We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
c02077 +++$+++ I don't trust anyone.
c19868 +++$+++ This is some boat.  Your father's?
c09330 +++$+++ You must really think I'm a square, a computer nerd.
c22628 +++$+++ He doesn't have one.
c20634 +++$+++ Do you like putting makeup on people?
c05688 +++$+++ What ain't there?
c03784 +++$+++ They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
c04071 +++$+++ Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
c15744 +++$+++ I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
c18334 +++$+++ If you're going to insult me --
c01796 +++$+++ Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
c15004 +++$+++ Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
c25069 +++$+++ You were in love with him, weren't you?
c18943 +++$+++ The same as Jane McKenna.
c19365 +++$+++ Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
c21554 +++$+++ Not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. People like Elias get wasted and people like Barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! We just don't add up to dry shit.
c12838 +++$+++ Not even if they're a dork?
c22167 +++$+++ What?
c26144 +++$+++ They said you had to run out.
c14295 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c25011 +++$+++ Well, we're FBI agents.
c23113 +++$+++ Chicken salad.
c16361 +++$+++ I mean -- for a living.
c15180 +++$+++ Of course not ...
c20909 +++$+++ You remember that story?
c12326 +++$+++ Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
c20773 +++$+++ Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
c00079 +++$+++ I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
c20315 +++$+++ I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
c11670 +++$+++ Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
c08004 +++$+++ I don't know.
c13633 +++$+++ You promise?
c23315 +++$+++ Silence?  No talking?  All day?
c19650 +++$+++ We go someplace dangerous.
c18902 +++$+++ -- Listen to me --
c09646 +++$+++ I can play the piano?
c04509 +++$+++ Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
c23793 +++$+++ I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
c04718 +++$+++ Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
c14214 +++$+++ You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
c26230 +++$+++ Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
c06993 +++$+++ Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
c00270 +++$+++ I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
c22681 +++$+++ What are we going to do?
c15689 +++$+++ Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
c09796 +++$+++ You must have a rather strange impression of us.
c09581 +++$+++ Do I look like a narc?
c17175 +++$+++ Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
c04284 +++$+++ Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
c25869 +++$+++ Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
c23667 +++$+++ Well, let me have it.
c11374 +++$+++ You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
c09124 +++$+++ I'm still in the chair, Lieutenant.
c21340 +++$+++ Sorry to trouble you.
c15389 +++$+++ I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
c05711 +++$+++ Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
c07828 +++$+++ Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
c05672 +++$+++ Married?
c16772 +++$+++ I know everything about you, Diana.
c15555 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c17420 +++$+++ What's the matter? What's happened?
c12856 +++$+++ Maybe it's because I live here.
c02083 +++$+++ Then shut up.
c11260 +++$+++ Yes, your highness.
c02597 +++$+++ We got what we wanted. That's enough.
c04118 +++$+++ We need more time.
c14821 +++$+++ Sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
c20933 +++$+++ What is it?
c05929 +++$+++ Yeah ... ?
c07671 +++$+++ No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
c08898 +++$+++ You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
c17731 +++$+++ I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
c16766 +++$+++ And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
c24315 +++$+++ Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
c23856 +++$+++ Don't, Beth.  Please.
c08295 +++$+++ But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
c23231 +++$+++ -- there's not much room --
c11852 +++$+++ That what you do?
c17818 +++$+++ ...I feel that...
c19190 +++$+++ But it's a delay!  How long? A day?  Two days?!
c07182 +++$+++ ...Where you want me to put it?
c16868 +++$+++ I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
c05049 +++$+++ Look at me. I'm ice cold.
c12745 +++$+++ They seemed to be plausible this time. A general strike is a good argument for the UN.
c24644 +++$+++ Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
c13623 +++$+++ When?
c09764 +++$+++ Erin. Who?
c03905 +++$+++ God, that's terrible.
c22896 +++$+++ I want to talk to you.
c21584 +++$+++ Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
c10993 +++$+++ Okay.
c07301 +++$+++ I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
c13854 +++$+++ And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
c21890 +++$+++ I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
c15800 +++$+++ -- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
c15166 +++$+++ Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
c23645 +++$+++ It's cold, Daddy!
c03729 +++$+++ Please--
c14916 +++$+++ Yes sir.
c15172 +++$+++ I never been up in a plane before.
c05945 +++$+++ Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
c27370 +++$+++ You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
c19465 +++$+++ A horse?
c20160 +++$+++ This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
c23375 +++$+++ She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
c16372 +++$+++ Same here.
c10817 +++$+++ And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
c23364 +++$+++ He has proposed to me twice.
c07610 +++$+++ What did he want?
c26700 +++$+++ I'm talking about prayer.
c21178 +++$+++ I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
c19253 +++$+++ What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
c16802 +++$+++ I heard you weren't coming.
c08245 +++$+++ I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
c00039 +++$+++ I say, do what you wanna do.
c14320 +++$+++ I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
c15885 +++$+++ It won't get through the blockade.
c13780 +++$+++ We're seeing all the signs in town.
c03299 +++$+++ John, it will not be easy.
c04866 +++$+++ I've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country, Mr. Shaw, and you're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president.
c04979 +++$+++ Lemme have the bag.
c17542 +++$+++ What choice!!?
c07611 +++$+++ No.
c00074 +++$+++ I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
c04918 +++$+++ It's different with men.
c14223 +++$+++ Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
c19338 +++$+++ So tell me where Nix is buried.
c10680 +++$+++ You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
c18269 +++$+++ We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
c04491 +++$+++ I was the next man.
c01902 +++$+++ I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
c22477 +++$+++ Really?
c10721 +++$+++ Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
c18206 +++$+++ We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
c10377 +++$+++ See what?
c17091 +++$+++ I don't know.
c05055 +++$+++ I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
c22350 +++$+++ Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
c18951 +++$+++ I am.
c26746 +++$+++ Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
c24946 +++$+++ Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
c24129 +++$+++ No, you don't.
c17118 +++$+++ But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
c22233 +++$+++ More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
c02052 +++$+++ Silicon Valley?
c12087 +++$+++ And a very, very good one.
c14497 +++$+++ I love your apartment.
c23407 +++$+++ You want to go with me?
c09674 +++$+++ Across at Brinkmeyer's.
c12332 +++$+++ I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
c06556 +++$+++ There *what* was?
c10192 +++$+++ Not to me.
c06970 +++$+++ Count d'Algout is still asleep.
c18779 +++$+++ They do, my brother.
c21877 +++$+++ Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
c19807 +++$+++ Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
c24541 +++$+++ I'm going to bed.
c11552 +++$+++ Something like that.
c10415 +++$+++ Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
c14113 +++$+++ Yeah, right.
c15084 +++$+++ Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
c00517 +++$+++ The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
c20947 +++$+++ The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
c24316 +++$+++ Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
c17955 +++$+++ She's talking to him now.
c04213 +++$+++ No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
c21045 +++$+++ Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
c03045 +++$+++ Oh, come now...
c21349 +++$+++ Brilliant, Admiral.
c11708 +++$+++ Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
c03434 +++$+++ Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
c16558 +++$+++ You gonna talk to him?
c12068 +++$+++ Didn't I say that?
c25132 +++$+++ Plus you have nothing else to do all day.
c14510 +++$+++ Yes, I suppose so.
c03587 +++$+++ The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
c07813 +++$+++ Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
c01444 +++$+++ I don't remember saying yes.
c26314 +++$+++ A lot that means.
c04867 +++$+++ But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
c25381 +++$+++ No!
c09539 +++$+++ He's already angry, I don't think --
c09071 +++$+++ What you're doing to my neck...
c13523 +++$+++ I never thanked you..the arrow..the motorcycle..the computer disc..You're so different from what I..and so the same.
c13427 +++$+++ You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
c03403 +++$+++ Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
c17904 +++$+++ Yeah? You and who else?
c18224 +++$+++ No.  We want ...
c07351 +++$+++ That's brilliant.
c07346 +++$+++ Does it still hurt?
c26760 +++$+++ No.
c14608 +++$+++ Fucking A, my friend.
c02416 +++$+++ Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
c08634 +++$+++ And that makes you look like a squid?
c11340 +++$+++ Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
c07913 +++$+++ How can you tell that from a thermometer!
c14237 +++$+++ Two, two-fifty.
c19051 +++$+++ Yes.
c15390 +++$+++ You're <u>sure</u>???
c15546 +++$+++ It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
c14775 +++$+++ The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
c04550 +++$+++ Without your pants.
c00268 +++$+++ Okay, I believe you.
c09306 +++$+++ You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
c25278 +++$+++ Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother's not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
c24728 +++$+++ Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
c17524 +++$+++ Good.
c12895 +++$+++ Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
c01651 +++$+++ That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
c10810 +++$+++ And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
c12166 +++$+++ Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
c08280 +++$+++ Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
c20155 +++$+++ Have to wait.
c13503 +++$+++ I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
c02640 +++$+++ Leave me alone.
c03014 +++$+++ Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
c07305 +++$+++ Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
c16435 +++$+++ Powerful warrior.
c06008 +++$+++ I know.
c15164 +++$+++ Why not?
c12411 +++$+++ They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
c14251 +++$+++ What you mean, no?
c07556 +++$+++ I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
c10655 +++$+++ Is that in my chart?
c19976 +++$+++ Then what is it?
c03937 +++$+++ That you feel that way about me.
c11566 +++$+++ Will you excuse me?
c18710 +++$+++ That's bullshit,
c21494 +++$+++ You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
c10654 +++$+++ You must be mistaken.
c02245 +++$+++ But, mom!
c16196 +++$+++ We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
c01441 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c13184 +++$+++ Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
c13845 +++$+++ ...about--
c04163 +++$+++ Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
c20230 +++$+++ No sir.
c05406 +++$+++ ...Good...  But what's special in him?
c11929 +++$+++ A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
c02693 +++$+++ I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
c06921 +++$+++ Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
c08063 +++$+++ My what?!
c19317 +++$+++ So what are we gonna do about this?
c21756 +++$+++ It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
c13533 +++$+++ You never miss a trick.
c09010 +++$+++ You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
c12936 +++$+++ They just left, didn't they?
c13909 +++$+++ I'll stop by.
c10622 +++$+++ Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
c17866 +++$+++ You know what I want, babe?
c04374 +++$+++ I told you you'd get your money back.
c22475 +++$+++ Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
c12491 +++$+++ Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
c14856 +++$+++ I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
c19094 +++$+++ They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
c10385 +++$+++ I always thought you knew it was me.
c20010 +++$+++ A BEER, please.
c07146 +++$+++ Yessir.
c11450 +++$+++ No, Z.  The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  I don't wanna see anything happen to you.  So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
c12871 +++$+++ Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
c16669 +++$+++ Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
c05596 +++$+++ I'm living here while I build another house.
c12704 +++$+++ Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
c15552 +++$+++ The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
c15618 +++$+++ Maybe it's not connected yet.
c24059 +++$+++ George, that is so kind of you.
c12875 +++$+++ Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
c01396 +++$+++ SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
c13368 +++$+++ Yeah.
c02903 +++$+++ Yes, Seth, I understand.
c20001 +++$+++ Your wife?
c06627 +++$+++ Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
c14441 +++$+++ What the hell you need her for?
c18532 +++$+++ No, I don't want to be rude.
c12679 +++$+++ Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
c19617 +++$+++ Linda --
c02211 +++$+++ Nothing on Hannah?
c15713 +++$+++ He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
c15597 +++$+++ FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
c12854 +++$+++ No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
c09431 +++$+++ Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
c08135 +++$+++ Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
c24543 +++$+++ What do you suggest, my dear?
c12388 +++$+++ But why, Son of Malkovich?
c03230 +++$+++ Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
c10016 +++$+++ Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
c01319 +++$+++ Really.
c11397 +++$+++ Not as a rule.
c19474 +++$+++ Thanks.
c11102 +++$+++ None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
c18855 +++$+++ Don't do that!
c23605 +++$+++ Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
c03257 +++$+++ Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
c25263 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c07297 +++$+++ Devil his due.
c05003 +++$+++ In a way, yes.
c22361 +++$+++ Yeah sure I'll grab something before I go...  Hey -- I've got a surprise.
c06740 +++$+++ This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
c11627 +++$+++ Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
c07036 +++$+++ Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
c21868 +++$+++ Get car.  Get car.
c07035 +++$+++ May I ask what has happened?
c24403 +++$+++ Did he have a wife?  Did he had a girl friend?  Did you know them?
c09122 +++$+++ I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
c01328 +++$+++ I need you on my side.
c04424 +++$+++ Is that all he said?
c10036 +++$+++ No, I just meant...
c10503 +++$+++ Captured?  How?
c03923 +++$+++ "Myers", huh? You have a first name??
c14137 +++$+++ So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
c22678 +++$+++ Hesitates.  Then drops his sulfa. Fumbles in his pack.  Finds the morphine.
c06313 +++$+++ Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
c14952 +++$+++ YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
c13830 +++$+++ ...our ass!
c05421 +++$+++ Huh?
c01470 +++$+++ Okay, but...
c24266 +++$+++ No.
c08339 +++$+++ Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
c11723 +++$+++ You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
c12295 +++$+++ Yes. I would like to do that.
c11702 +++$+++ Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
c23785 +++$+++ Uh...over easy.
c24702 +++$+++ This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
c24314 +++$+++ This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
c13921 +++$+++ Is that unusual?
c26833 +++$+++ What <u>are</u> you interested in?
c22630 +++$+++ But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
c27439 +++$+++ There's only one way.
c20204 +++$+++ You know we had reservations about each other.  Isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?
c24158 +++$+++ Well, I-I hope that--that--
c00078 +++$+++ Oh?  So you are a new man?
c20861 +++$+++ Then I'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. I'm making the run, Dixie.
c26494 +++$+++ They ruined me tonight.
c14939 +++$+++ But father, it's not fair.
c00358 +++$+++ Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
c11844 +++$+++ Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
c06021 +++$+++ Yeah.
c05407 +++$+++ It's better...  You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf.  I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
c01345 +++$+++ I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
c01661 +++$+++ Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
c07418 +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me?
c02242 +++$+++ Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
c24144 +++$+++ Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
c10154 +++$+++ Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
c00774 +++$+++ I swear --
c13588 +++$+++ How do you know?
c26156 +++$+++ I understand.
c05694 +++$+++ I knew you wouldn't come if I didn't have a map.
c18759 +++$+++ I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
c02601 +++$+++ He's smart, powerful, successful --
c09378 +++$+++ I really want to catch up with you, but I've gotta take this call. They're holding. I'll talk with you when you get back in town. Bye.
c19442 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c26774 +++$+++ What's the assignment?
c00636 +++$+++ Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
c01682 +++$+++ It was... It was...
c14772 +++$+++ There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
c11576 +++$+++ You mean you bring other girls up here?
c25131 +++$+++ You shouldn't.
c25369 +++$+++ Supposing she's an assassin?
c05732 +++$+++ An angel?
c10683 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c13165 +++$+++ Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
c10406 +++$+++ My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
c05480 +++$+++ I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
c25495 +++$+++ He's just forgotten.  You know he forgets everything.
c20513 +++$+++ Thank you, won't you come in ?
c26822 +++$+++ Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
c15919 +++$+++ What is this place, Merlin?
c20595 +++$+++ Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
c04083 +++$+++ I've been to Church Hill.
c17601 +++$+++ Brady! Come with us! Brady!
c13380 +++$+++ You never - ?
c14830 +++$+++ Really?  And how is his state of mind?
c27033 +++$+++ Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
c19619 +++$+++ Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
c05318 +++$+++ Has he gotten through to any?
c27410 +++$+++ You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
c10113 +++$+++ Go!
c09606 +++$+++ Well...
c24025 +++$+++ ...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
c03188 +++$+++ Don't be silly, anyone can dance. Here, just follow me... watch my feet.
c27215 +++$+++ I know what he said.
c18274 +++$+++ Watch it, Archer --
c10031 +++$+++ I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
c17069 +++$+++ He told me my share was twenty-five.
c03140 +++$+++ You don't? What happened to Muff?
c07884 +++$+++ I was just...
c19361 +++$+++ Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
c07217 +++$+++ ...what're you saying?
c17857 +++$+++ Good plan.
c18195 +++$+++ What about all my other stuff?
c14724 +++$+++ Daddy, it's true.
c19002 +++$+++ Only can I still see him?
c01694 +++$+++ I guess not.
c27111 +++$+++ What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
c25212 +++$+++ You want to lie down for a while?
c16394 +++$+++ I quit.
c21348 +++$+++ It must of been a convincing letter.
c17781 +++$+++ I'm an orphan.
c10058 +++$+++ Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
c21817 +++$+++ I tell you once again -- surrender!
c11567 +++$+++ You know I liked it better long.
c18732 +++$+++ You do?
c23191 +++$+++ -- what?  -- I'll see you later...
c05751 +++$+++ It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
c24784 +++$+++ Claire.
c06981 +++$+++ All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
c09297 +++$+++ No bad news. You know the Be On the LookOut you asked me to send on the diner car -- we got a hit on it. A little town on the border, Socorro. We got it staked out -- you interested?
c11003 +++$+++ Now what?
c18969 +++$+++ The prospect of losing my child.
c11626 +++$+++ So Kurtz is alive.
c16179 +++$+++ But it's twenty degrees outside...
c27325 +++$+++ What caused it?
c27012 +++$+++ You - are - a - murderer.
c05696 +++$+++ Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
c10314 +++$+++ I haven't paid you.
c05998 +++$+++ He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
c01864 +++$+++ Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
c21553 +++$+++ You been smoking too much shit babe. Gotta control that. Takes a man down... I remember when you first come out to the bush, you was straight as a...
c12067 +++$+++ Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
c10911 +++$+++ Would you like one?  Huh?
c23267 +++$+++ I'm Jack Torrance.
c03631 +++$+++ You're too young. You should be in school.
c22932 +++$+++ How's that?
c08558 +++$+++ Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
c18559 +++$+++ Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
c27142 +++$+++ And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
c17451 +++$+++ So, what are you doing now?
c24102 +++$+++ It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
c13420 +++$+++ Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
c11969 +++$+++ Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
c22050 +++$+++ Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
c00567 +++$+++ Humiliated?
c10540 +++$+++ What's that?
c17013 +++$+++ River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
c23900 +++$+++ Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
c19231 +++$+++ All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
c22693 +++$+++ This evening is over.
c11867 +++$+++ Scalene?
c19370 +++$+++ I don't think so.  You need me alive.
c06869 +++$+++ Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
c04023 +++$+++ Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
c23573 +++$+++ You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
c00997 +++$+++ Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
c18794 +++$+++ The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
c12984 +++$+++ And what if I couldn't do that?
c10402 +++$+++ I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
c17058 +++$+++ Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck that.  Fuck it...Get on my side. Go with me.  Let's do something. You want to run this office, run it.
c21061 +++$+++ Who told you that?
c01459 +++$+++ What about E.M.S. recombination?
c12075 +++$+++ No.  No glass on the inside.
c06356 +++$+++ Look, why don't you just come on back inside for a second.
c01885 +++$+++ Evan Treborn.
c00779 +++$+++ Yep.
c05346 +++$+++ That's not fair!
c17036 +++$+++ I was at home, where were you?
c02281 +++$+++ What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
c15221 +++$+++ I would like to get paid now.
c12256 +++$+++ Fine. Would you like me to speak to your personal physician?
c18348 +++$+++ That was a joke? You don't tell jokes.
c22739 +++$+++ No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
c07411 +++$+++ Don't I know it. Every brother I knew in 'Nam's dead. My company... a land mine. Twenty of my friends dead in less than a second.
c22135 +++$+++ Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
c03569 +++$+++ You're sweet.
c09173 +++$+++ If there's one ideal the Federation holds most dear it's that all men, all races, can be united. From the first time the Vulcans came to Earth we've sought a future of peace. Nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friend- ship. In time. When trust has been earned.
c18685 +++$+++ Jake.
c00483 +++$+++ Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
c02896 +++$+++ Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here?
c04211 +++$+++ Say, I've been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. Where'd you get it?
c25001 +++$+++ Because I never have.  That's why you go places, isn't it?
c26775 +++$+++ The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
c25287 +++$+++ Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
c15225 +++$+++ You keep it.
c03395 +++$+++ But have never been?
c21221 +++$+++ What kind of symbol?
c04068 +++$+++ Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
c19743 +++$+++ What's that?
c09455 +++$+++ You know I love spaghetti.
c23600 +++$+++ I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
c12514 +++$+++ From his father, of course.
c27373 +++$+++ It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
c08159 +++$+++ Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
c12700 +++$+++ And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
c10135 +++$+++ It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
c23826 +++$+++ To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
c11405 +++$+++ You want me to uninvite her?
c23073 +++$+++ Yes.
c21847 +++$+++ Yes, it's quite possible.
c13585 +++$+++ And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
c25908 +++$+++ Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
c23778 +++$+++ Why would you help me?
c23954 +++$+++ My experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the Enterprise, this crew...
c19660 +++$+++ A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
c00835 +++$+++ He has a great body
c01165 +++$+++ It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
c06274 +++$+++ You betcher ass, Dad.
c21060 +++$+++ Why not?
c04909 +++$+++ What did they want to know?
c26329 +++$+++ Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
c06337 +++$+++ Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and--
c25701 +++$+++ And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
c11188 +++$+++ You have to pay attention to a girl. Be sensitive to her feelings. Relationships are reciprocal.
c16750 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c04703 +++$+++ I'm reporting you to the IRS.
c11501 +++$+++ What's her first name?
c14972 +++$+++ Joey...
c23610 +++$+++ Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
c26045 +++$+++ Roald Dahl.
c11878 +++$+++ What year?
c22220 +++$+++ Take it easy.
c13208 +++$+++ Don't be silly.  What are you sorry about?
c18474 +++$+++ Miss Wollsten!
c21842 +++$+++ Yes, sir.  Thank you.
c17849 +++$+++ Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
c16546 +++$+++ What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
c04031 +++$+++ Hey, I just want to know where I stand.  What chance --
c24230 +++$+++ Can I have some?
c16262 +++$+++ ...The heck d'ya mean?
c26446 +++$+++ You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
c21121 +++$+++ Is that bad?...
c20388 +++$+++ It's so infernally cold in here.
c14008 +++$+++ No, you're not.
c22899 +++$+++ And why is that?
c21438 +++$+++ What kind of person is that?
c08981 +++$+++ Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
c24687 +++$+++ I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
c22917 +++$+++ TATUM!
c26779 +++$+++ Do I get to see it or not?
c07069 +++$+++ How is this national security?
c25019 +++$+++ I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
c08584 +++$+++ Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
c19870 +++$+++ Sure.
c22205 +++$+++ Check the scrawl.
c15602 +++$+++ Because my life is being ruined.
c12235 +++$+++ What?
c18623 +++$+++ So do I.  But for different reasons.
c25669 +++$+++ Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
c03280 +++$+++ Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
c20180 +++$+++ 'Thief in the Night?'
c07853 +++$+++ You wanna commit suicide, fine! You got some death- wish, fine! But you will not drag this company down with you!
c20962 +++$+++ I won't allow it.
c22731 +++$+++ Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
c16698 +++$+++ No, I think he's up in interrogation.
c17336 +++$+++ --But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
c07790 +++$+++ You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
c14399 +++$+++ In jail.
c08273 +++$+++ What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
c26551 +++$+++ The Doctors were not negligent.
c04454 +++$+++ It's doing what?
c13304 +++$+++ Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
c09857 +++$+++ It's shorted out or something!
c09772 +++$+++ Stay away from me! Stay away!
c11040 +++$+++ Yes, Addison.
c11310 +++$+++ Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
c02851 +++$+++ Only if you'll tell me who he is.
c05194 +++$+++ What do you make with that?
c19570 +++$+++ And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
c14079 +++$+++ Yeah, right.
c19058 +++$+++ I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
c01282 +++$+++ Are you sure?
c14134 +++$+++ That woulda been cool.
c06161 +++$+++ [Where do I find him?]
c04356 +++$+++ How good is he?
c15159 +++$+++ He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
c07434 +++$+++ I beg to differ.  One is a command decision on your part.  The other represents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances.
c24558 +++$+++ Do bullets really bounce off you?
c14291 +++$+++ Is that what they told you?
c06880 +++$+++ How should I...?
c08738 +++$+++ Her oxygen would have run out.
c08494 +++$+++ What's that?
c12014 +++$+++ When was the last time you saw John Boz?
c26094 +++$+++ I don't understand...
c00173 +++$+++ That's right.
c26890 +++$+++ Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
c23323 +++$+++ Not the choir, please, anything but that.  The choir -- I mean, have you heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that I
c17223 +++$+++ Of course.
c01495 +++$+++ One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
c20195 +++$+++ Much.
c05088 +++$+++ You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
c03088 +++$+++ You positive about that?
c13084 +++$+++ They're a bit overworked these days. Luckily I intercepted your call.
c24187 +++$+++ What do you suppose is going to happen if General Ripper's planes start bombing their targets?
c01098 +++$+++ Then why did you quit?
c11213 +++$+++ Yes.
c03440 +++$+++ You really will?
c21256 +++$+++ Yeah, why?
c24888 +++$+++ I miss my kids.
c26223 +++$+++ You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
c18169 +++$+++ -- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
c03959 +++$+++ Well we can't just stay here --
c03210 +++$+++ Okay, okay!
c22163 +++$+++ You think I don't hear things?
c21667 +++$+++ Let me see.
c11318 +++$+++ Yeah.
c15727 +++$+++ I'll come with you.
c05810 +++$+++ What night is that?
c18310 +++$+++ You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
c18809 +++$+++ Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
c13948 +++$+++ Yes...
c02623 +++$+++ Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
c20285 +++$+++ Yeah.
c21987 +++$+++ I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
c21136 +++$+++ What?
c12713 +++$+++ It would be my pleasure.
c07725 +++$+++ That's right you travel so much.
c03893 +++$+++ No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
c01252 +++$+++ You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
c11813 +++$+++ You will wish you hadn't.
c12883 +++$+++ What?
c24111 +++$+++ You'd rather spoil our walk home.
c00697 +++$+++ Come on, where?
c24611 +++$+++ What is it?
c00744 +++$+++ Yes, thank you.
c12797 +++$+++ If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
c17066 +++$+++ No.  It hadn't.
c26979 +++$+++ And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
c24376 +++$+++ I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
c05858 +++$+++ They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
c01018 +++$+++ Have you any place in mind?
c09438 +++$+++ I'm going to finish school.
c08390 +++$+++ I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
c26707 +++$+++ You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
c25308 +++$+++ What is?
c02002 +++$+++ Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
c21717 +++$+++ Please, we hardly know each other.
c00209 +++$+++ Why?
c26920 +++$+++ What's that?
c22385 +++$+++ Well, hurry up.
c17115 +++$+++ Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth!
c07093 +++$+++ That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're willing to put up a shitpot fulla money to get rid of him -- more money'n you ever dreamed of.
c07026 +++$+++ She's gone, Leon.
c05885 +++$+++ You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
c13622 +++$+++ You think that's wise?
c09425 +++$+++ The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
c13850 +++$+++ That's right.
c18267 +++$+++ Every year?
c07480 +++$+++ Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
c25228 +++$+++ How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
c16465 +++$+++ Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
c18180 +++$+++ -- even if I give you a million as well?
c21171 +++$+++ I don't know.
c18155 +++$+++ Why?
c06600 +++$+++ What did you mean by that?
c03635 +++$+++ Working the what?
c10852 +++$+++ Yes, Mother.
c25150 +++$+++ Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
c16149 +++$+++ That's right. And auto supply...
c23102 +++$+++ What?
c13857 +++$+++ ...tight!
c25863 +++$+++ Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
c23155 +++$+++ One of my few virtues is discretion.
c01693 +++$+++ Yes.
c15721 +++$+++ It's what I've learned.
c21414 +++$+++ Silicon is from sand.
c12357 +++$+++ Money, Miss Warts?
c04610 +++$+++ Three hours.
c18134 +++$+++ Can we phone them in, Paul?
c18191 +++$+++ We don't have proof of that.
c21700 +++$+++ Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
c15374 +++$+++ You gotta be kiddin' me.
c00436 +++$+++ Some kids were teasing you?
c23704 +++$+++ The F word?!
c12583 +++$+++ What was that?
c22568 +++$+++ What's wrong with Annie?
c26709 +++$+++ What?
c09492 +++$+++ I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
c17629 +++$+++ Sure.
c01850 +++$+++ I need you so much! I love you!
c13211 +++$+++ Um...
c24869 +++$+++ This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means.
c13296 +++$+++ Except for Prom.
c05754 +++$+++ Where do you send them?
c15710 +++$+++ Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
c08038 +++$+++ He says he wants it now.
c00144 +++$+++ Well, he killed my partner!
c18053 +++$+++ I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
c15491 +++$+++ Walt needs to see you.
c17635 +++$+++ Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
c17178 +++$+++ Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
c20676 +++$+++ I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
c05572 +++$+++ Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
c16452 +++$+++ "Terminate with extreme prejudice."
c06951 +++$+++ Sure, sure, honey. You just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that's what I've been saying all along.
c16283 +++$+++ Yah, real good.
c20722 +++$+++ What?
c08271 +++$+++ But he also wrote --
c18194 +++$+++ Maybe it was Colleen...
c09293 +++$+++ No.
c05889 +++$+++ What do you mean - "fade away like an echo"?
c07331 +++$+++ Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
c24481 +++$+++ Storms! Floods!
c01723 +++$+++ We've got sixteen dollars.
c09532 +++$+++ Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
c18875 +++$+++ You're not going to be there?
c24356 +++$+++ I just don't.
c22755 +++$+++ I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
c07941 +++$+++ And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
c21741 +++$+++ I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
c21550 +++$+++ In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
c03724 +++$+++ It's your house, Dad.
c26536 +++$+++ Gruber...
c13879 +++$+++ Where is she?
c02635 +++$+++ It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
c09956 +++$+++ Because I don't think I'm crazy.
c24134 +++$+++ I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
c03392 +++$+++ Caesar?
c15817 +++$+++ You're married.
c00869 +++$+++ Perrier? San Pellegrino?
c19846 +++$+++ What pipes?
c18297 +++$+++ I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
c00460 +++$+++ Other way around, sir.
c07759 +++$+++ I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
c27048 +++$+++ What did you do with her?
c05823 +++$+++ That's why I married you.
c12617 +++$+++ Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
c10765 +++$+++ A nap?
c14226 +++$+++ ...if they're wrong?!
c25222 +++$+++ But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
c09282 +++$+++ Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
c12905 +++$+++ One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
c05741 +++$+++ You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
c08970 +++$+++ We'll be going to warp speed --
c11313 +++$+++ You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
c23744 +++$+++ You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
c09767 +++$+++ But you, you've had them.
c06228 +++$+++ You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
c08411 +++$+++ Count me out.
c01904 +++$+++ Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
c11141 +++$+++ --almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
c24785 +++$+++ Underwear?
c13500 +++$+++ Are you sure?
c23786 +++$+++ Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
c03034 +++$+++ No.  I guess.
c22319 +++$+++ I can't do that.
c11377 +++$+++ It's the way they do things.
c02865 +++$+++ I got to.
c19191 +++$+++ You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
c12189 +++$+++ Howls he getting on with the family?
c21885 +++$+++ No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
c22038 +++$+++ I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
c26185 +++$+++ What?
c15426 +++$+++ Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
c19499 +++$+++ You weren't at my game.
c26189 +++$+++ If I thought I could get away with it -
c24104 +++$+++ And I'm going to win.
c03394 +++$+++ I'll nose around...
c14334 +++$+++ So we passed some kind of test?
c17005 +++$+++ Three hundred altogether?
c22373 +++$+++ I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
c16658 +++$+++ You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
c23895 +++$+++ I think there are some things we should talk about.
c08855 +++$+++ As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
c26661 +++$+++ You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
c05199 +++$+++ It's a loft.
c01826 +++$+++ What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
c18189 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c20007 +++$+++ What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
c01993 +++$+++ If I'd known you were alive --
c15011 +++$+++ Merle...
c10060 +++$+++ The sawbones?
c22576 +++$+++ Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
c24820 +++$+++ You want company?
c22733 +++$+++ I don't know.  I'm happy.
c18825 +++$+++ There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
c23526 +++$+++ I already said that, b...
c03329 +++$+++ It's really not a bad place.  It just needs a woman's touch.
c14506 +++$+++ No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
c00742 +++$+++ Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
c01936 +++$+++ Yes.
c24870 +++$+++ Are you serious.
c22465 +++$+++ Or a vegetarian?
c05859 +++$+++ And be poisoned out here in the open?
c26287 +++$+++ It's Grace.
c26534 +++$+++ That was our insurance company's recommendation.
c01011 +++$+++ I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
c16381 +++$+++ Why wasn't I involved from the beginning?  You and I started fight club together.
c05740 +++$+++ What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
c23063 +++$+++ What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
c04059 +++$+++ Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
c16685 +++$+++ Where the hell is it?
c11482 +++$+++ What do I do?
c08321 +++$+++ Prettier than Ann?
c13077 +++$+++ Actually, there's someone I want to meet ...
c25641 +++$+++ They're watching us now.
c15087 +++$+++ Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
c06150 +++$+++ I don't know shit about you.
c08577 +++$+++ Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
c15257 +++$+++ What?
c06113 +++$+++ I don't know what to say to Allah.
c07522 +++$+++ What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
c23687 +++$+++ Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
c16689 +++$+++ What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
c15519 +++$+++ Four of the defendants recanted their testimony.
c17196 +++$+++ Thoreau with a lawnmower.
c05699 +++$+++ Crawfords.
c04638 +++$+++ We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
c26968 +++$+++ Not the focus.
c08033 +++$+++ So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
c00222 +++$+++ That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
c07851 +++$+++ You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
c17107 +++$+++ I can help you.
c05971 +++$+++ Come on!
c08251 +++$+++ Because there was another girl-- years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once --- I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
c17051 +++$+++ ...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
c02772 +++$+++ Oh no...
c21299 +++$+++ I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
c08568 +++$+++ Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
c08798 +++$+++ ... Hard?
c22512 +++$+++ Does it have wheat in it?
c21119 +++$+++ Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
c04800 +++$+++ I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
c22306 +++$+++ It's the Irish tape we want.
c22822 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c17334 +++$+++ That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?"
c21491 +++$+++ 15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. Five total to launch.
c07124 +++$+++ Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
c13450 +++$+++ I did - I didn't -
c15567 +++$+++ And Reynolds?
c26386 +++$+++ It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
c21192 +++$+++ D 'n D?
c13483 +++$+++ 'Cause it clogs up your heart.
c20133 +++$+++ I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
c14456 +++$+++ And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
c27453 +++$+++ I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
c23418 +++$+++ Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
c08142 +++$+++ I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
c14045 +++$+++ Territoriality. He was mine first.
c18818 +++$+++ These formations.  They're dried --
c27186 +++$+++ Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
c15830 +++$+++ Keep your voice down.
c05819 +++$+++ I'll get a manual.  and study it.
c26424 +++$+++ He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
c07784 +++$+++ It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
c03751 +++$+++ You have chills?
c02132 +++$+++ I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
c03811 +++$+++ Tonight. When you get out, we'll go.  Why didn't you tell the other detective?
c25312 +++$+++ The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
c24466 +++$+++ Columbia.
c19913 +++$+++ You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
c12824 +++$+++ I'm not leaving without that tape.
c21800 +++$+++ What?
c06455 +++$+++ Not stupid. Fat.
c19104 +++$+++ It's ten after nine.
c01550 +++$+++ Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
c03542 +++$+++ I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
c02065 +++$+++ We'll take care of it.
c08602 +++$+++ Stuttering--
c06111 +++$+++ Where am I gonna start?
c18298 +++$+++ I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
c22581 +++$+++ Who? A scab?
c11948 +++$+++ Can be. Not easy, but -
c20705 +++$+++ Maybe you can look after me a little.
c14667 +++$+++ This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
c13056 +++$+++ How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
c17588 +++$+++ Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
c21631 +++$+++ Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
c10689 +++$+++ Me? Sure. Why?
c07697 +++$+++ -- what are you talking about, come on --
c12345 +++$+++ Why?
c26836 +++$+++ Dartmouth
c10448 +++$+++ You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
c11029 +++$+++ Aren't you?
c25773 +++$+++ No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
c11380 +++$+++ It has your ring.
c25082 +++$+++ I don't know.
c24987 +++$+++ Sure she would.
c00554 +++$+++ Cross my heart.
c01905 +++$+++ And the other alternative?
c22010 +++$+++ I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
c27442 +++$+++ Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
c26428 +++$+++ I'll help you.
c21583 +++$+++ Nobody believed I wasn't in on it. I was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  I thought it was a legitimate business.  He was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  I never saw the pies.  They had names. For the record.  Innocent names.  You know where that kind of money comes from, don't you?
c26072 +++$+++ No, but you can bet they will.
c05609 +++$+++ I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
c18774 +++$+++ Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
c03282 +++$+++ There is no reason for fear.
c25609 +++$+++ Which boarder?  Saudi?  Kuwait?  Syria?
c24306 +++$+++ Oh, come on, Pony. I'm just kidding. Wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? You know, there's a life on the road?
c12637 +++$+++ Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
c22613 +++$+++ Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
c15481 +++$+++ Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
c05781 +++$+++ Is it inside the city?
c14116 +++$+++ I love you. Don't feel sick.
c15665 +++$+++ Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
c14875 +++$+++ I can't say.
c23521 +++$+++ Apparently.
c00356 +++$+++ So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
c22182 +++$+++ See how fast he is -- damn!
c26095 +++$+++ Sybok, we must find a way...
c23750 +++$+++ You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
c19423 +++$+++ Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
c04034 +++$+++ Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
c21536 +++$+++ No.
c16855 +++$+++ Alla puttanesca.
c26754 +++$+++ And in the vegetable plot?
c13460 +++$+++ I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
c05997 +++$+++ But John was with him at the pool?
c21924 +++$+++ Satisfied with your cabin?
c04474 +++$+++ Except he's lost, and I'm not.
c01427 +++$+++ It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
c06615 +++$+++ Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
c12284 +++$+++ I see.
c24301 +++$+++ Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
c01506 +++$+++ I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
c06866 +++$+++ When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
c05763 +++$+++ I suppose. But what if you want to live?
c18947 +++$+++ I was wondering what that was.
c07104 +++$+++ Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
c19810 +++$+++ What did she tell you?
c15917 +++$+++ Guenevere...
c01000 +++$+++ I didn't. Mother did.
c09736 +++$+++ A doctor?
c26431 +++$+++ That's great.
c16581 +++$+++ My lawyer was a bum.
c09481 +++$+++ I hope it wasn't cheap.
c15556 +++$+++ Not good enough.
c17232 +++$+++ Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
c26583 +++$+++ Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
c15395 +++$+++ No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
c02048 +++$+++ You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
c05800 +++$+++ Yeah... Call me at home. I'll give you the number.
c18887 +++$+++ -- Eduard --
c20614 +++$+++ Yes.
c18484 +++$+++ We still don't know that it's the plague ----
c01537 +++$+++ I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
c22184 +++$+++ Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
c17049 +++$+++ Would you come in here, please?
c26155 +++$+++ Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
c24770 +++$+++ That one did.
c17759 +++$+++ Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken.
c10248 +++$+++ I'm listening.
c11800 +++$+++ But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
c15668 +++$+++ Okay.  And what do you love? Say everything.
c08883 +++$+++ You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
c19257 +++$+++ It wasn't just you, Bunny.
c21913 +++$+++ And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
c23753 +++$+++ It's a beautiful thing.
c23141 +++$+++ I am not!
c11347 +++$+++ What'd I do?
c08548 +++$+++ What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
c24285 +++$+++ What?
c04457 +++$+++ Dick-weed!
c03563 +++$+++ Should throw a great weight into the balance...
c22299 +++$+++ How could you have done that?
c16675 +++$+++ My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
c10277 +++$+++ I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
c24715 +++$+++ He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
c05469 +++$+++ I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
c12795 +++$+++ Yes -- he did.
c24907 +++$+++ Mm.
c21250 +++$+++ You find out?
c07970 +++$+++ I'll wait for him.
c21862 +++$+++ That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
c22446 +++$+++ Hey, man, you can use her. She's an expert!
c02170 +++$+++ ...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
c23735 +++$+++ Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
c14071 +++$+++ The milkmaids.
c14388 +++$+++ Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
c09363 +++$+++ Why? You're not a real man?
c12632 +++$+++ No. I should go.
c06937 +++$+++ My flesh and blood!
c06017 +++$+++ Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
c16325 +++$+++ The first rule of Project --
c25298 +++$+++ It's not.
c08502 +++$+++ Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock.
c00914 +++$+++ You've been coming in early.
c09313 +++$+++ Its called insubordination.
c08827 +++$+++ Strong...
c27411 +++$+++ No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
c20594 +++$+++ Deceased.
c26597 +++$+++ It's a long road that has no turning.
c11758 +++$+++ Average.
c16342 +++$+++ I'm just on my way out...
c16874 +++$+++ What a pity.
c24464 +++$+++ Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
c12901 +++$+++ I said, no thanks.
c16531 +++$+++ I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
c08112 +++$+++ I think he's just passed out.
c19108 +++$+++ Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
c14390 +++$+++ I want to die.
c05906 +++$+++ No. just peace on Earth.
c25757 +++$+++ I don't understand.
c00787 +++$+++ Fine. I'll just wait here.
c23732 +++$+++ Really?
c09794 +++$+++ The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
c23872 +++$+++ You don't remember that?
c15069 +++$+++ What Grange?
c27403 +++$+++ So this is what it's like to be completely happy!
c19068 +++$+++ That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
c07696 +++$+++ Why's it here?
c00282 +++$+++ He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
c25000 +++$+++ Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
c26736 +++$+++ Greenpeace?
c06216 +++$+++ Waddaya getting so sore about?
c22925 +++$+++ You know that's not true.
c17155 +++$+++ Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
c24657 +++$+++ And he's a perfect stranger to me.
c16222 +++$+++ And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
c16390 +++$+++ She's... you... you're fucking her.
c06892 +++$+++ Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
c03698 +++$+++ I suppose.
c17041 +++$+++ That's great.
c02821 +++$+++ What?
c11113 +++$+++ You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
c07504 +++$+++ Is that so?
c04269 +++$+++ The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
c13832 +++$+++ Forty-nine point four.
c02498 +++$+++ I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
c04695 +++$+++ No.
c07618 +++$+++ Heavens! The man's insane!
c25458 +++$+++ Then you'll do it?
c25787 +++$+++ She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
c08207 +++$+++ You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
c02047 +++$+++ You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
c13796 +++$+++ Shh. Ben's party. Tonight. Haven't you heard?
c00439 +++$+++ Put your pilot on.
c01798 +++$+++ Lots of people...
c19833 +++$+++ Sounds good.
c17424 +++$+++ Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
c08349 +++$+++ It's me, Rollo Linsky. Remember me?
c21640 +++$+++ You'd go to jail. For a long term.
c05004 +++$+++ I call your office, she better answer the phone.
c13930 +++$+++ Including the death of your husband?
c11457 +++$+++ -- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
c15498 +++$+++ I was lonely.  You took advantage
c08107 +++$+++ I don't believe in it.
c04561 +++$+++ Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
c02162 +++$+++ Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
c06189 +++$+++ You think too much?
c15765 +++$+++ Gin, really.
c05778 +++$+++ No, there doesn't. Not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called Sanctuary becomes "real". But it doesn't exist. It never existed. Just the hope.
c20506 +++$+++ I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
c11436 +++$+++ Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
c20824 +++$+++ I guess I'll rob a bank.
c16505 +++$+++ Just finish eating.
c06437 +++$+++ Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
c25338 +++$+++ Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
c12098 +++$+++ Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
c15118 +++$+++ What is it don't work out that way? Where you gonna stay?
c17512 +++$+++ What?
c15815 +++$+++ Ross.
c05029 +++$+++ I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
c26010 +++$+++ What is it you want me to do?
c13507 +++$+++ The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
c18114 +++$+++ Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
c01166 +++$+++ I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
c04056 +++$+++ Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
c11579 +++$+++ I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
c27066 +++$+++ You'll never believe who's in there.
c22383 +++$+++ No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto.
c22085 +++$+++ Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
c23683 +++$+++ More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
c19532 +++$+++ So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
c25205 +++$+++ In the lake?
c00926 +++$+++ Who can we trust?
c11155 +++$+++ Give me your checkbook then.
c02953 +++$+++ I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
c21453 +++$+++ No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
c04932 +++$+++ He's liable to shoot you.
c10453 +++$+++ And all we've got is a witch doctor!
c21769 +++$+++ Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
c15559 +++$+++ I'll take your word for it.
c24677 +++$+++ Why?
c04481 +++$+++ Right.
c19609 +++$+++ I think that you know.
c13885 +++$+++ No thanks.
c21410 +++$+++ Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty--fifty.
c24506 +++$+++ The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
c16235 +++$+++ That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
c01066 +++$+++ I'm not really hungry.
c21694 +++$+++ What?
c08555 +++$+++ -- Flesh is weak.
c04127 +++$+++ How did you find me?
c11042 +++$+++ You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
c17634 +++$+++ Thanks.
c21251 +++$+++ Getting me out of Glades for starters.
c03199 +++$+++ So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
c23204 +++$+++ But...
c18569 +++$+++ Someone has to do something.
c06493 +++$+++ Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
c22999 +++$+++ Of course not!
c04006 +++$+++ Oh.  Right.  But I'd forgotten about that.  I wasn't biting the idea.
c21597 +++$+++ That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
c11294 +++$+++ You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
c15829 +++$+++ I'm just saying --
c11333 +++$+++ Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
c20301 +++$+++ Where's pop?
c23551 +++$+++ Get me Room 414.
c26225 +++$+++ Where's that?
c26771 +++$+++ Sid 6.7 is now armed.
c09538 +++$+++ Tell him I have a fiancee, Dickie has a fiancee and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
c12255 +++$+++ However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
c04795 +++$+++ Amazing.
c12454 +++$+++ Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
c01568 +++$+++ Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
c23258 +++$+++ And you didn't see anything at all?
c14661 +++$+++ I look terrible.
c03890 +++$+++ Like a tea ceremony?
c04905 +++$+++ She leaves, somebody'll be on her.
c04129 +++$+++ Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
c11300 +++$+++ So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
c23940 +++$+++ I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
c11846 +++$+++ I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
c09960 +++$+++ But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
c23283 +++$+++ I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
c03427 +++$+++ I've never been to it.
c05023 +++$+++ I thought you said she didn't say much.
c19047 +++$+++ You will always!
c10087 +++$+++ That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
c13038 +++$+++ Please, I've got to find Jill.
c08040 +++$+++ He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you.
c04763 +++$+++ Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller.
c14549 +++$+++ We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
c15612 +++$+++ Stacy--
c09818 +++$+++ The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
c17895 +++$+++ Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
c16295 +++$+++ No, see -
c16026 +++$+++ Why would I mind?
c13707 +++$+++ By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
c20552 +++$+++ WHAT??
c00791 +++$+++ Hell of a war.
c24787 +++$+++ Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
c09934 +++$+++ They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
c04429 +++$+++ No.
c03017 +++$+++ No! I swear I don't know! Please!
c15923 +++$+++ The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
c14615 +++$+++ Well, how's your friend?
c14750 +++$+++ I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
c11132 +++$+++ What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
c25332 +++$+++ Very funny. Can I go on now?
c19110 +++$+++ Shitbutt?
c06695 +++$+++ Why don't you tell me?
c04165 +++$+++ Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
c05769 +++$+++ Maybe you'll think of something...
c26358 +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
c20783 +++$+++ Where's he at?
c27357 +++$+++ That's alright, I'll figure something out.
c06160 +++$+++ [The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
c03625 +++$+++ Never.
c13690 +++$+++ Yes, you told me.
c15496 +++$+++ Yep.
c11147 +++$+++ Night.
c03508 +++$+++ You got me.
c00563 +++$+++ Extremely clever.
c27354 +++$+++ I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
c26239 +++$+++ I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
c18835 +++$+++ He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
c06835 +++$+++ And I can go free?
c15106 +++$+++ Let him try it.
c17544 +++$+++ You and Frank ever take a vacation?
c26460 +++$+++ Maybe I ain't.
c23755 +++$+++ Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
c09505 +++$+++ Hardly.
c14981 +++$+++ What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
c05821 +++$+++ The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
c15424 +++$+++ Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
c10909 +++$+++ Nothing...
c05976 +++$+++ Kill me!
c09858 +++$+++ I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
c25368 +++$+++ What difference does it make where she comes from?
c00695 +++$+++ Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
c00447 +++$+++ Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
c22263 +++$+++ Not to me, you know that.
c25958 +++$+++ Bad news?!
c07747 +++$+++ As soon as you want.
c17827 +++$+++ No.
c19785 +++$+++ It's probably just a strained muscle.
c16160 +++$+++ Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it'll be returned!
c12876 +++$+++ Would you like a beer for your bath?
c23003 +++$+++ God be praised!  Locked?
c22438 +++$+++ What's wrong with that?
c09141 +++$+++ As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
c16641 +++$+++ Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
c09554 +++$+++ My name is Travis.
c00026 +++$+++ You need money to take a girl out
c22829 +++$+++ Thanks.
c27122 +++$+++ You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
c02862 +++$+++ I love you.
c22405 +++$+++ Are you serious?
c22024 +++$+++ Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.
c19995 +++$+++ I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
c26611 +++$+++ Why did she never tell her daughter?
c05550 +++$+++ Certainly understandable.
c10660 +++$+++ What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
c05115 +++$+++ My kids were on that beach...
c24628 +++$+++ It's okay.
c11631 +++$+++ This -- Bob Hope or the like --
c19450 +++$+++ You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
c17922 +++$+++ You should go in.  You're risking your life again...
c02411 +++$+++ Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
c15442 +++$+++ Really?
c20585 +++$+++ Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
c22577 +++$+++ The men would like to know who this gentleman is.
c04773 +++$+++ Your ego is colossal.
c21659 +++$+++ Both dead.
c20700 +++$+++ I'm fine. Can I go up?
c06044 +++$+++ You wanna go right now?
c16756 +++$+++ Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
c07062 +++$+++ ... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
c20473 +++$+++ This Denny's.
c10760 +++$+++ I said I was sorry.
c13017 +++$+++ -- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
c20952 +++$+++ Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
c10873 +++$+++ Sister Marguerite I think.
c09808 +++$+++ We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
c10432 +++$+++ You're going to stay here...?
c22084 +++$+++ Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
c22634 +++$+++ But I just met you.
c24514 +++$+++ Like me?
c19310 +++$+++ Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
c22508 +++$+++ Am I what they had in mind?
c13344 +++$+++ She's playing with my mind.
c27388 +++$+++ How?
c22614 +++$+++ That's long enough to get out of town.
c01636 +++$+++ It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
c26947 +++$+++ This fence...it's so...
c04016 +++$+++ I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
c13497 +++$+++ You're probably right.
c26662 +++$+++ I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
c06941 +++$+++ He never asked me for nothin'.
c10020 +++$+++ What?
c15983 +++$+++ The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
c27397 +++$+++ What was your grandfather's name?
c06868 +++$+++ Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
c10404 +++$+++ You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
c15146 +++$+++ Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
c10814 +++$+++ Have you decided?
c23437 +++$+++ Will he be supervised?
c11829 +++$+++ 'Bout what?
c10564 +++$+++ What is it?
c10653 +++$+++ It's cool, Jeff. Really.
c07562 +++$+++ Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live--
c10895 +++$+++ I can beat that.
c26596 +++$+++ A single hour.
c25718 +++$+++ <u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
c24472 +++$+++ Stone mutha.
c00979 +++$+++ And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
c21167 +++$+++ I'll get home all right now.
c17345 +++$+++ --You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
c02776 +++$+++ What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
c21177 +++$+++ If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
c14648 +++$+++ German.
c24223 +++$+++ Take it easy, Major Kong.
c18858 +++$+++ That's not true...
c11265 +++$+++ I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
c25512 +++$+++ Not at all.
c07718 +++$+++ Yeah.
c01148 +++$+++ And what are the Mau-Mau's going to do for us today?
c24756 +++$+++ I just called.
c21194 +++$+++ So help me God!
c14713 +++$+++ I think I should.  3000W?
c05565 +++$+++ Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
c09729 +++$+++ She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
c00219 +++$+++ Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
c02703 +++$+++ What limes?
c13794 +++$+++ You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
c02490 +++$+++ Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
c08534 +++$+++ I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
c20679 +++$+++ I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
c23052 +++$+++ You learn that in your psychotherapy group?
c18508 +++$+++ And besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York, and you're here in Bedford Falls.
c06436 +++$+++ It consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. We try to oblige.
c23111 +++$+++ The first one was fine.
c19228 +++$+++ And that does include the amp?
c21457 +++$+++ Uh.... No. Not really.
c25198 +++$+++ Everything about what?
c14350 +++$+++ That's not doubt.  That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.  I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
c25969 +++$+++ He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
c07274 +++$+++ Wesley...
c21112 +++$+++ Well, not exactly...
c01462 +++$+++ I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
c26129 +++$+++ You're kidding.
c05806 +++$+++ I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else...  To a girlfriend's house.  But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
c17093 +++$+++ We'll speak to her, Jim...
c09085 +++$+++ Where?
c04226 +++$+++ Is it hard?
c06923 +++$+++ -- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, John!
c06392 +++$+++ Prude.
c09998 +++$+++ I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
c14548 +++$+++ A thousand dollars?
c21946 +++$+++ Did you? Where?
c27328 +++$+++ I did not.  Now get out of my way!
c14023 +++$+++ Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
c23337 +++$+++ Really?  Lieutenant?
c14015 +++$+++ They do it only because you do!
c11295 +++$+++ Huh? Oh... yeah.
c10795 +++$+++ No.
c00331 +++$+++ No really, it's a fable.  The 'guardian of good' dreams.  It was like my teddy bear when I was growing up.
c22280 +++$+++ It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
c07753 +++$+++ I'll just see you when you get back here.
c15526 +++$+++ Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
c01706 +++$+++ You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
c23804 +++$+++ Fletcher!  Now!
c22213 +++$+++ I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
c11173 +++$+++ We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
c01979 +++$+++ If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
c19177 +++$+++ It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
c08594 +++$+++ I don't know, Cole.
c21087 +++$+++ No.
c25426 +++$+++ No, it was a table.
c15770 +++$+++ Suspicious, after all these years?
c09923 +++$+++ Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
c16749 +++$+++ Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
c06319 +++$+++ Who, for instance?
c26316 +++$+++ I had a problem getting my car back.
c18344 +++$+++ What you been up to?
c03397 +++$+++ Fools to let us both live; we'll be our own best witnesses at our trial.
c09204 +++$+++ Closed?
c16743 +++$+++ That's an eyeball!  Oh, God!
c02524 +++$+++ And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
c13093 +++$+++ I should be going. I just quit.
c22245 +++$+++ [Within] Juliet!
c18517 +++$+++ Well, you remember my kid sister, Mary?
c07252 +++$+++ Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
c06324 +++$+++ Where'd you play?
c17720 +++$+++ Go right over there.
c16127 +++$+++ You can tell me all about it -- from your prison cell.
c00508 +++$+++ Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
c01841 +++$+++ Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
c09583 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c00608 +++$+++ Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
c08603 +++$+++ Chuck E. who?
c24154 +++$+++ Whoopee.
c25490 +++$+++ We were getting 50 from our guy.
c20343 +++$+++ ... but a two-thirds majority ...
c04255 +++$+++ Do you believe this fucking girl?
c20789 +++$+++ You working?
c13169 +++$+++ No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
c01945 +++$+++ Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
c21380 +++$+++ Terry! Slow down.
c16843 +++$+++ Oh yeah?
c05545 +++$+++ Track the demon to his lair.
c02125 +++$+++ Did they tell you to sleep with me?
c26986 +++$+++ How did you--
c09555 +++$+++ The moon?
c09951 +++$+++ How? Did they figure it out after I died?
c04422 +++$+++ It was so real, Dad.
c23318 +++$+++ I got it.
c12714 +++$+++ But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
c08921 +++$+++ My readings indicate great instability.
c09078 +++$+++ There must be some good people... even in this time.
c27207 +++$+++ Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in -
c03482 +++$+++ Then why do you want to talk about it?
c03301 +++$+++ It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
c10823 +++$+++ I'm too sleepy.
c03604 +++$+++ Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
c24997 +++$+++ How do you know?
c03081 +++$+++ Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
c06145 +++$+++ How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
c18384 +++$+++ Do it again.
c20483 +++$+++ Then he isn't embezzling either is he ?
c15732 +++$+++ The windows don't open.
c08938 +++$+++ But, why?
c25501 +++$+++ He wouldn't say.
c05677 +++$+++ I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
c10311 +++$+++ You phoned up Art Esparza's wife?
c00732 +++$+++ What is that, Mr. Bones?[7]
c00029 +++$+++ Forget it.
c22210 +++$+++ That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
c19986 +++$+++ Amnesia?
c04293 +++$+++ I guess not.
c00480 +++$+++ Yeah.
c18856 +++$+++ I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
c00449 +++$+++ A dubious distinction, no?
c08467 +++$+++ How do they know it's over?
c26672 +++$+++ You're interrupting a personal conversation.
c06832 +++$+++ Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
c01426 +++$+++ The hell you call me?
c12530 +++$+++ No --
c08444 +++$+++ Yeah, weird. But great.
c25424 +++$+++ Sorry, I don't remember.
c01182 +++$+++ For what?
c23193 +++$+++ What is.
c14962 +++$+++ Well, you sure do a good imitation.
c22756 +++$+++ I don't have to like her just because you do.  It doesn't work that way.
c04883 +++$+++ Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
c15751 +++$+++ So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
c20411 +++$+++ Is that not enough?
c20116 +++$+++ Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
c06971 +++$+++ Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
c14834 +++$+++ Why, yes.
c06371 +++$+++ So what do you want?... An autograph.
c12807 +++$+++ Yes.
c04511 +++$+++ Don't let it curl around you!
c11923 +++$+++ She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
c23172 +++$+++ Not yet.
c09673 +++$+++ A what?
c08833 +++$+++ How is he?
c14095 +++$+++ You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
c15124 +++$+++ I'm going to count to three...
c21624 +++$+++ Right.
c03645 +++$+++ Bullshit!
c04461 +++$+++ You sure?
c07506 +++$+++ On what?
c02653 +++$+++ Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
c08227 +++$+++ I'll give you a check.
c25983 +++$+++ Just watching you.
c04535 +++$+++ Just walk down the hall?
c06952 +++$+++ She lived there.
c18480 +++$+++ Her family name?
c12995 +++$+++ Yes.
c10047 +++$+++ Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
c23678 +++$+++ BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
c07966 +++$+++ I was talking to Jim.
c07140 +++$+++ Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
c15728 +++$+++ What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
c07005 +++$+++ A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
c16395 +++$+++ Defuse the bomb?
c19241 +++$+++ Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
c23881 +++$+++ But it's impossible.
c11112 +++$+++ She wanted to explain about her interview, wanted to apologize to someone - and didn't dare face Margo...
c04764 +++$+++ The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
c23120 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c13044 +++$+++ She witnessed the Tuttle arrest - the Buttle arrest - and since then she's been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she's working for somebody, and she's not working for us.
c04384 +++$+++ Call it.
c05514 +++$+++ There's a pizza welcome lunch in twenty minutes. Does that count?
c15961 +++$+++ You know how?
c21911 +++$+++ Can you?
c07073 +++$+++ Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
c21234 +++$+++ Yes.
c01533 +++$+++ I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
c04677 +++$+++ Asian? No.
c18509 +++$+++ You're not paid to be a canary.
c04487 +++$+++ Feels like a cigarette lighter.
c13167 +++$+++ Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
c06782 +++$+++ So what can I get you?
c13058 +++$+++ Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
c17276 +++$+++ She was so great, why'd you leave her?
c15453 +++$+++ She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
c20848 +++$+++ Can you read my mind?
c21128 +++$+++ Only what?
c22910 +++$+++ They think it's school-related?
c05759 +++$+++ I'm fine...  See you...
c09448 +++$+++ Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
c19336 +++$+++ Right.
c18223 +++$+++ Sure.  Why?
c22661 +++$+++ As a matter of fact, I am.
c24302 +++$+++ You do?
c26908 +++$+++ You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
c13036 +++$+++ Too late? That's for me to say.
c08433 +++$+++ Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
c20288 +++$+++ He's coming.
c23209 +++$+++ Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
c05225 +++$+++ Were they wearing condoms?
c08732 +++$+++ My wife.
c21947 +++$+++ You think money is the only requisite. It happens that the poor people are happier.
c01954 +++$+++ Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
c00788 +++$+++ So?
c23026 +++$+++ But the plague
c21284 +++$+++ No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
c14932 +++$+++ Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
c20069 +++$+++ They've been targeted.  And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
c10334 +++$+++ Go away. I am not talking to you.
c22885 +++$+++ Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
c12946 +++$+++ Shut up, Violet.
c18452 +++$+++ Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
c10141 +++$+++ Are you hungry? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
c11504 +++$+++ Yes, I've got it.  Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
c06334 +++$+++ You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
c12175 +++$+++ That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
c15113 +++$+++ Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
c11554 +++$+++ Yeah, wasn't I?
c00052 +++$+++ Why not?
c06128 +++$+++ Is my family here yet?
c05947 +++$+++ The nano... what?
c11220 +++$+++ Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
c03700 +++$+++ Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
c22222 +++$+++ If you're so innocent, why'd you run?
c05753 +++$+++ No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
c21898 +++$+++ Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
c14360 +++$+++ In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
c23827 +++$+++ Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
c07184 +++$+++ You on all night?
c18905 +++$+++ I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
c07997 +++$+++ Yeah.  So where's the high school?
c06494 +++$+++ I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
c07110 +++$+++ Elvis I like, too.
c17383 +++$+++ Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
c17355 +++$+++ Sean, I really don't think you understand--
c12551 +++$+++ Then I'm going--
c03339 +++$+++ Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
c03958 +++$+++ I said no.
c01217 +++$+++ O'Grady.
c01175 +++$+++ So what's up with you?
c25588 +++$+++ You can't tell anybody about this.
c22466 +++$+++ Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
c16797 +++$+++ You let me worry about him, okay?  Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.
c22363 +++$+++ Well I don't know --
c07221 +++$+++ Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
c14712 +++$+++ Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
c23640 +++$+++ What do that mean?
c16769 +++$+++ I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
c19320 +++$+++ Couple months before I was born--
c23536 +++$+++ But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
c09422 +++$+++ I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
c20792 +++$+++ Well, they seem just like everyone else.
c16533 +++$+++ Oh. You have to tell me that.
c09870 +++$+++ Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
c21793 +++$+++ "Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
c08137 +++$+++ They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
c06081 +++$+++ I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
c07323 +++$+++ Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
c19545 +++$+++ Who was it?
c06898 +++$+++ Oh, yes. I'll show you. I have much more colors at home.
c07892 +++$+++ Aw, c'mon, Vick --
c18277 +++$+++ I --
c24421 +++$+++ But what if---it wasn't real?
c00764 +++$+++ The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
c02571 +++$+++ I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
c08258 +++$+++ Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
c00298 +++$+++ Enlighten me.
c06112 +++$+++ I sure met some.
c06238 +++$+++ Don't worry about it.
c05665 +++$+++ I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
c07663 +++$+++ This thing works. We could go home right now.
c12339 +++$+++ Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
c22445 +++$+++ What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
c02785 +++$+++ No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
c10792 +++$+++ I'm taking you back out.
c25810 +++$+++ He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
c25758 +++$+++ No-o!
c15325 +++$+++ Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
c16524 +++$+++ If you're free.
c16407 +++$+++ Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
c13834 +++$+++ Bullshit, yeah.  Well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
c26285 +++$+++ They look nice.
c22745 +++$+++ No, really.
c10037 +++$+++ That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
c01449 +++$+++ Not in that company.
c15882 +++$+++ What's in there?
c01194 +++$+++ C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
c06686 +++$+++ It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
c26154 +++$+++ Dickless.  If they took care of				* business, I'd be out of business, know what I mean?
c17130 +++$+++ Why didn't someone tell me!
c24292 +++$+++ I'm sorry. I, I gotta...
c18735 +++$+++ Wasn't frozen, was it, Sergeant?
c09364 +++$+++ Like what?
c25389 +++$+++ Why not?
c21117 +++$+++ So?...
c03948 +++$+++ Frank --
c23449 +++$+++ I'd like to see your pictures some day.
c05536 +++$+++ Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
c18785 +++$+++ I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
c16999 +++$+++ That's not always a healthy way to be...
c22909 +++$+++ Yeah.
c24604 +++$+++ Crafts?
c09453 +++$+++ Have you agreed on a meeting?
c09660 +++$+++ Mom, they're in a cage!
c17213 +++$+++ What did you expect?  Bronze?
c15147 +++$+++ Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
c14446 +++$+++ No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
c13817 +++$+++ Now don't be nervous.
c26933 +++$+++ That's not true.
c14925 +++$+++ But I love you.
c05796 +++$+++ Listen.
c00520 +++$+++ Well... Yeah, it's rubber.  It stretches.
c10162 +++$+++ Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
c14404 +++$+++ That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
c25552 +++$+++ On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
c08491 +++$+++ All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
c04679 +++$+++ What do you mean, was.
c25056 +++$+++ Nothing.
c20684 +++$+++ I won first prize.
c07144 +++$+++ Sir, I don't want to picture that.
c18125 +++$+++ You will tell them the truth.
c15480 +++$+++ I thought you were supposed to keep them.
c00652 +++$+++ I'll call tomorrow.
c05227 +++$+++ Did what take?
c22750 +++$+++ This is great, this gives me hope.  Thanks.
c25770 +++$+++ I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
c25682 +++$+++ <u>Tonsili!</u>
c24868 +++$+++ Something like that, yeah.
c09874 +++$+++ I was lucky.  The others weren't.
c10996 +++$+++ But?
c07446 +++$+++ You don't hate him.
c12094 +++$+++ Hey, what's your problem?
c11078 +++$+++ What are you doing here?
c00854 +++$+++ Who?
c07376 +++$+++ 478...
c04709 +++$+++ Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
c11324 +++$+++ I'm following you and David, if you-
c18243 +++$+++ God, I wish I could say the same thing.  What about having a nice, dull dinner with me tonight. Scrabble, Knock-knock jokes, Anecdotes about famous dead Italians....
c12291 +++$+++ No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
c20323 +++$+++ Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
c21509 +++$+++ Well, what's it look like now?
c06306 +++$+++ Who?
c24773 +++$+++ I'm tired.  I'm sorry, I should go. I've been enough of a nuisance.
c13172 +++$+++ Follow me.
c10776 +++$+++ Why do you want to know?
c19422 +++$+++ Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
c22429 +++$+++ Shortcut?
c18018 +++$+++ What do you think?
c14882 +++$+++ Yes.
c22606 +++$+++ No.
c07678 +++$+++ Why don't you just take me back without it?
c13072 +++$+++ What?  Look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
c10213 +++$+++ Like what?
c16433 +++$+++ I've seen worse places.
c14340 +++$+++ The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
c11964 +++$+++ ...Yes, thank you.
c03617 +++$+++ Why?
c08849 +++$+++ You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
c15341 +++$+++ I dunno.  Lie on the beach?
c10129 +++$+++ Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
c08320 +++$+++ Then what happened?
c05633 +++$+++ I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
c26989 +++$+++ Sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
c15098 +++$+++ Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
c08288 +++$+++ Sometimes. Afterward.
c08819 +++$+++ An even five I throw in the jacket.
c11438 +++$+++ "Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
c24986 +++$+++ The memory of who?
c06652 +++$+++ I say we don't want to appear greedy.
c23483 +++$+++ Well, maybe just one. To be polite.
c00459 +++$+++ Thank you for calling the white House...
c19435 +++$+++ Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
c07698 +++$+++ Sure.
c18925 +++$+++ -- Yes.
c15350 +++$+++ It takes me comfortable.
c21333 +++$+++ He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
c24850 +++$+++ These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
c27365 +++$+++ Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
c02982 +++$+++ Major, what do you think could have done this?
c26918 +++$+++ The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
c09575 +++$+++ I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
c15165 +++$+++ No.  I had some legal training, but...
c12804 +++$+++ Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
c00938 +++$+++ There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
c08058 +++$+++ The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians!
c24118 +++$+++ Restless.
c12503 +++$+++ What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
c01691 +++$+++ No. You sure you're okay?
c21082 +++$+++ Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
c03289 +++$+++ I have been desperate for Patterson to let me move the hospital since the day he arrived.
c02139 +++$+++ 25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
c04836 +++$+++ Keep saying what?
c14632 +++$+++ Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
c25331 +++$+++ Mossad?
c13148 +++$+++ Watch? --
c18833 +++$+++ Unpredictability....
c05212 +++$+++ Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
c21673 +++$+++ Have you come to talk about me?
c13926 +++$+++ I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
c08777 +++$+++ What do you want to do?
c16755 +++$+++ Whaddya mean?
c06807 +++$+++ I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
c15908 +++$+++ Who?
c18036 +++$+++ Must you fight him?
c20600 +++$+++ I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
c16177 +++$+++ You look forward to this party all year.  What's with you today?
c02825 +++$+++ Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
c07419 +++$+++ Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
c12944 +++$+++ What happened to them?
c06677 +++$+++ Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
c03576 +++$+++ As you remember it -- when you approached us...
c02631 +++$+++ Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
c14004 +++$+++ Oh, no, that's all gone.
c10161 +++$+++ So they took care of Leo.
c08188 +++$+++ What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
c11621 +++$+++ Nah.
c15304 +++$+++ I'm sorry Gurney.
c14435 +++$+++ What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
c12610 +++$+++ Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look. I better go.
c10106 +++$+++ You look great.
c05079 +++$+++ Paul Gruneger!
c17260 +++$+++ About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
c01158 +++$+++ DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
c15545 +++$+++ Something like that.
c24864 +++$+++ Modelling.
c03505 +++$+++ No.
c19894 +++$+++ Like a marriage made in heaven?
c00085 +++$+++ I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
c03545 +++$+++ I've no luck.
c07083 +++$+++ Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.
c24883 +++$+++ Which kind?
c23460 +++$+++ Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
c17483 +++$+++ Would you describe their position as inflexible?
c12935 +++$+++ I can't.  I can't.
c04433 +++$+++ Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
c24033 +++$+++ I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
c16635 +++$+++ I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
c08943 +++$+++ But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
c09742 +++$+++ Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
c02663 +++$+++ Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
c00509 +++$+++ Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
c08352 +++$+++ GOT MY HEM SO HIGH THEY'LL SAY I'M BEING CHEEKY
c12145 +++$+++ I don't-.
c00427 +++$+++ Well, it was an accident.
c12667 +++$+++ OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
c02719 +++$+++ IS THERE A GUN POINTING AT YOU?
c13937 +++$+++ Katherine?... Katherine who?
c08368 +++$+++ Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
c06011 +++$+++ No.
c14707 +++$+++ Are they nice?
c23846 +++$+++ His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
c20915 +++$+++ The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
c12135 +++$+++ Rinka.
c23893 +++$+++ I don't know.
c19452 +++$+++ It's another day.  I think I'm alright.
c10910 +++$+++ So you left the Church because you had freckles?
c13984 +++$+++ Yes, very!  Naturally.
c09211 +++$+++ Why?
c21760 +++$+++ Cynthia's not coming?
c13257 +++$+++ Yeah.
c05414 +++$+++ ...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
c22817 +++$+++ I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
c18356 +++$+++ Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
c27090 +++$+++ I have absolutely no intention--
c15445 +++$+++ Oh that was... no, I ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. It's you. I want you.
c13437 +++$+++ You've been very open with us. I mean, uh, your books and papers and... that - that's gonna mean something when you go before the Commission.
c25934 +++$+++ What must I do?
c18926 +++$+++ Yes.
c16461 +++$+++ Two kids tried to set me on fire.
c21428 +++$+++ Whatever.
c22862 +++$+++ And then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. It's a perfect ending.
c19745 +++$+++ Lt. Fisk said...
c21360 +++$+++ Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
c10986 +++$+++ If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
c27091 +++$+++ I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
c09397 +++$+++ Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
c18595 +++$+++ That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
c09786 +++$+++ You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
c23161 +++$+++ Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
c23442 +++$+++ Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
c13982 +++$+++ Please, Mr. Bernstein.
c00935 +++$+++ Milo, geeks don't have two girlfriends. Most don't have one.
c16098 +++$+++ Vegetables.
c02256 +++$+++ So... that's it?
c05524 +++$+++ We go out, smash 'em now?
c04459 +++$+++ Was his father stationed here?
c00897 +++$+++ What're you -- what?
c20987 +++$+++ That's spectacularly unfair.
c01874 +++$+++ Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
c06331 +++$+++ Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
c01982 +++$+++ Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
c12163 +++$+++ As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
c00178 +++$+++ I see.
c13400 +++$+++ What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
c24579 +++$+++ Sure.
c08923 +++$+++ If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
c13317 +++$+++ A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
c20811 +++$+++ Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
c04556 +++$+++ Osaka?
c25550 +++$+++ What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
c18215 +++$+++ The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
c26783 +++$+++ Should I have?
c16473 +++$+++ Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
c10946 +++$+++ Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
c15020 +++$+++ Where?
c16719 +++$+++ When?
c03558 +++$+++ I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
c05465 +++$+++ Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
c04132 +++$+++ It doesn't.
c26584 +++$+++ She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
c03942 +++$+++ Lucky man.
c27078 +++$+++ That's me.
c02068 +++$+++ Calls?
c19376 +++$+++ Nobody's better off this wav!
c11355 +++$+++ without getting... well, let's put it this way...
c04665 +++$+++ Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
c22295 +++$+++ And what job is that?
c13610 +++$+++ Make a pass or something. Isn't that the way it goes?
c19605 +++$+++ You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
c04818 +++$+++ I ain't got a hat.
c22042 +++$+++ It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
c08824 +++$+++ I'd never admit that.
c10757 +++$+++ What did you want to happen?
c27044 +++$+++ And it can't be forged?
c08417 +++$+++ They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
c19843 +++$+++ That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
c16645 +++$+++ I'm sorry, that dress.  What do you say we...
c25898 +++$+++ What do you make of all this?
c14229 +++$+++ I'm standing right here.
c23128 +++$+++ I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
c12977 +++$+++ If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
c15410 +++$+++ That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
c20157 +++$+++ That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
c04376 +++$+++ All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
c02652 +++$+++ Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
c27205 +++$+++ What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
c04378 +++$+++ What time?
c12666 +++$+++ Let's wait for some slow one.
c20923 +++$+++ There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.
c21058 +++$+++ I don't trust you!
c06262 +++$+++ This is Ho-Jon, my houseboy. Our houseboy. I'm teaching him English.
c16650 +++$+++ You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
c10283 +++$+++ Car wash?!  That's got no future. If we're gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
c00557 +++$+++ Can we dream?
c25370 +++$+++ ... as always, majesty...
c05323 +++$+++ I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
c13012 +++$+++ You have ID?
c26127 +++$+++ You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
c00556 +++$+++ Gone.
c14532 +++$+++ Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.
c17970 +++$+++ Well, can I make an appointment?
c03753 +++$+++ That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
c17354 +++$+++ You moved?
c27315 +++$+++ Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
c12880 +++$+++ I had a temper.
c04601 +++$+++ I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
c13228 +++$+++ You didn't mean to what?
c27143 +++$+++ Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
c19251 +++$+++ Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
c25604 +++$+++ We'll lie.
c00933 +++$+++ Bring it to the other location.
c02646 +++$+++ It's definitely your mama.
c09787 +++$+++ Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
c13074 +++$+++ {suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
c13119 +++$+++ That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
c07010 +++$+++ You must, darling.
c02228 +++$+++ For a change.
c09026 +++$+++ No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
c23057 +++$+++ You call them if you want.
c13653 +++$+++ You may be right.
c17741 +++$+++ Yeah, it was.
c13751 +++$+++ Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
c19834 +++$+++ Can't we come with you?
c15741 +++$+++ I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
c27035 +++$+++ ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
c19875 +++$+++ I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
c21814 +++$+++ As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
c06289 +++$+++ You really say the cutest things.
c22427 +++$+++ I was being polite.
c02312 +++$+++ Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
c10730 +++$+++ Ask me. Ask me anything.
c14384 +++$+++ He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
c02808 +++$+++ Where are you going?
c04821 +++$+++ Worst comes to the worst, we got his car for security.
c02687 +++$+++ Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
c07612 +++$+++ No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
c16629 +++$+++ You're onto something. That's good. What?
c07303 +++$+++ You -
c23171 +++$+++ -- took a bus.
c16835 +++$+++ A thousand things.
c09456 +++$+++ Michael, I love you.
c02997 +++$+++ I don't know... It just wasn't like him.
c27047 +++$+++ What's with all the locks - and hammering
c05561 +++$+++ I don't... understand.
c00820 +++$+++ What is that?
c20509 +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe we should watch the tape to be sure.
c06806 +++$+++ From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
c09922 +++$+++ Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
c19786 +++$+++ No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
c16358 +++$+++ I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
c16667 +++$+++ I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
c19139 +++$+++ And the questionnaire...?
c11394 +++$+++ But she's alright.
c01574 +++$+++ We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
c04125 +++$+++ He knows I'm here.  How?
c17561 +++$+++ Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
c00698 +++$+++ I'll tell you when we get there.
c09115 +++$+++ And what did they tell you?
c23524 +++$+++ Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
c08733 +++$+++ I wish you'd told me.
c21180 +++$+++ I don't rate it.
c25987 +++$+++ In school?
c10251 +++$+++ You're Kuato, right?
c25580 +++$+++ What about Jaeger?
c12899 +++$+++ Hey, Eddie Mack don't like no wackos on his street.  Go be Rain Man on some other bitch's block.
c00882 +++$+++ Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
c25865 +++$+++ Ike Clanton, Old Man's eldest Son.  Know he ain't got the stuff, Makes him miserable.
c23356 +++$+++ I hear nothing.
c26656 +++$+++ Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
c01211 +++$+++ Maybe I need to do a lot of things.
c20228 +++$+++ Itis all right, Ethan..youill bring me back...wonit you...
c19060 +++$+++ Like my mother.
c07883 +++$+++ You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
c26321 +++$+++ You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
c18394 +++$+++ She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
c24818 +++$+++ Why?
c20289 +++$+++ Maybe you're right.
c27285 +++$+++ She'll get over it.
c01099 +++$+++ -- I work for the city.
c12040 +++$+++ Your people.
c09195 +++$+++ I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
c14332 +++$+++ Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
c01889 +++$+++ I thought I was the bad guy!
c11448 +++$+++ Neither does Joe.
c23138 +++$+++ See if you've been making it with my mother.
c25874 +++$+++ ... 17 Beverage cup holders?
c08493 +++$+++ Never will again.
c05985 +++$+++ All right.  Tell you what I'll do. First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence and I'll have Gideon run the Containment files, see if anyone drowned a woman named -- what did you say her name was?
c06165 +++$+++ [This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
c11823 +++$+++ The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
c02424 +++$+++ Oh, for goodness' sake!
c20059 +++$+++ How do I discuss operations over an open line?
c04608 +++$+++ Where?
c11680 +++$+++ I'll never forget you said it.
c10089 +++$+++ The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
c19057 +++$+++ Completely.
c19577 +++$+++ Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
c17293 +++$+++ Talk? To you? After what you did!
c23015 +++$+++ It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
c23410 +++$+++ We'll be on teams, me and you?
c07596 +++$+++ Well!
c08879 +++$+++ Don't bother, Sefton. I don't like you. I never did and I never will.
c25492 +++$+++ This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
c17086 +++$+++ Yes.
c00095 +++$+++ Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
c04940 +++$+++ He say is a surprise.
c17778 +++$+++ I had... one moment, I had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
c03113 +++$+++ Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
c02024 +++$+++ I know.  Is *that* nothing.
c13747 +++$+++ Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
c21104 +++$+++ Mickey Spillane?
c05852 +++$+++ Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
c01793 +++$+++ You don't know what you're getting into here.
c19824 +++$+++ No, you're not.
c00656 +++$+++ It's a full moon. Where is he?
c22665 +++$+++ Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
c09466 +++$+++ You've read about my father in the papers.  You've seen that no one's here to guard him.  Now I've just gotten word that men are coming to this hospital to kill him.  Believe me and help me.
c23975 +++$+++ But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
c17666 +++$+++ Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
c06908 +++$+++ ..."and I won't never tell about the money."
c02491 +++$+++ I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
c04070 +++$+++ Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
c07456 +++$+++ Worse.
c16651 +++$+++ Are you okay?
c05557 +++$+++ Will you chance a miss?
c20652 +++$+++ No, I'm hiding out.
c17412 +++$+++ No, but I aim to before sundown. Gettin' kind of excited about it, too. Which way you going?
c03529 +++$+++ Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
c00152 +++$+++ I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
c00974 +++$+++ My son?
c22488 +++$+++ Yes I do!
c06047 +++$+++ Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
c08508 +++$+++ Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
c23510 +++$+++ We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
c24581 +++$+++ Why did you do that, Billy?
c02979 +++$+++ No. Perhaps I work too much.
c12970 +++$+++ It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
c16238 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c02843 +++$+++ What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
c07081 +++$+++ I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
c18410 +++$+++ You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
c16679 +++$+++ J'ai pas confiance en lui.
c12998 +++$+++ We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
c20534 +++$+++ Well you should at least try a little bit.
c00069 +++$+++ How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
c01216 +++$+++ Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
c12886 +++$+++ BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
c07476 +++$+++ You'll get it back.  Or one better.
c07272 +++$+++ What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
c01749 +++$+++ Yeah.
c15377 +++$+++ And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
c16691 +++$+++ It's Cloudy.  Open the door.
c25491 +++$+++ I don't know.  He took it hard.
c19224 +++$+++ I wanted to talk to you about that.
c17180 +++$+++ But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
c03885 +++$+++ But you're not going anywhere, are you?
c10741 +++$+++ I'd say you're moving.
c06662 +++$+++ Twenty! What did he do with them?
c23383 +++$+++ Can I see him?
c13472 +++$+++ You fucked with me for the last time!
c08681 +++$+++ Now, you just find him, son.
c03208 +++$+++ Why?
c15247 +++$+++ We're all special. Everyone Lloyd and I chose for the class is special.
c11615 +++$+++ What Truth?
c14767 +++$+++ Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
c07571 +++$+++ Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We are having a reception here this evening--
c22821 +++$+++ If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
c06341 +++$+++ Did you want to see her about something important?
c02104 +++$+++ Habib?
c15415 +++$+++ You said that.
c21951 +++$+++ Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
c23278 +++$+++ Thanks a million, Uncle Al!
c16819 +++$+++ This could be it.
c09287 +++$+++ And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
c04057 +++$+++ Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
c27079 +++$+++ Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
c12059 +++$+++ I didn't know Tony Bennett painted.
c26441 +++$+++ Three days. Are you hungry?
c07469 +++$+++ A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
c08192 +++$+++ Yes.
c25031 +++$+++ You're... quitting?
c18723 +++$+++ No.
c17479 +++$+++ --Nooo--
c23387 +++$+++ Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
c04996 +++$+++ Yeah.
c07924 +++$+++ Goodnight, you idiot.
c06467 +++$+++ Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
c21592 +++$+++ You were there when I last saw him.
c25474 +++$+++ Where you goin'?
c03086 +++$+++ I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
c04347 +++$+++ No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
c11281 +++$+++ I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
c09189 +++$+++ Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
c07076 +++$+++ Sir?
c12676 +++$+++ I don't know why we have to watch T.V.
c21739 +++$+++ Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
c12340 +++$+++ All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
c23020 +++$+++ Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
c10121 +++$+++ And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
c12528 +++$+++ You don't look so good.
c23486 +++$+++ Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
c26311 +++$+++ Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
c00710 +++$+++ Yeah.
c05770 +++$+++ If you trusted me, you'd know.
c05437 +++$+++ Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
c01455 +++$+++ I have to get to Sugai.
c16376 +++$+++ She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
c25563 +++$+++ I wish you'd tell me who.
c04154 +++$+++ Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
c12063 +++$+++ Uh-oh!
c21344 +++$+++ Maybe not.  But I need you to know.  I love you.  And I will come back.  I'll find a way.  And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
c24200 +++$+++ Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
c09302 +++$+++ We had to bring staff in from the whole county to handle this.
c19714 +++$+++ You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
c02278 +++$+++ How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
c12817 +++$+++ It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
c06574 +++$+++ The Head Man's writing a Bill.
c16969 +++$+++ To the demon king's castle, of course.
c20098 +++$+++ I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
c10460 +++$+++ Huh. And why is that?
c26349 +++$+++ I wasn't hitting on your girl!
c17455 +++$+++ I want to be an actor.
c19439 +++$+++ I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
c11513 +++$+++ It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
c26244 +++$+++ Right!  You're right.  I have to fix this.
c11946 +++$+++ I don't know, Garland; my place is here right now. I feel I'm on the brink of success-
c25283 +++$+++ By your Austrian?
c11980 +++$+++ I thought you hardly know her.
c18642 +++$+++ I want to see Kathryn.
c11239 +++$+++ Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
c05595 +++$+++ Why?
c22076 +++$+++ Birth control's important.
c22260 +++$+++ Well I don't!
c03358 +++$+++ Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
c06519 +++$+++ You know--little worms--ambition.
c17892 +++$+++ What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
c01741 +++$+++ Why'd you want to help us?
c11060 +++$+++ Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
c05777 +++$+++ Of course.
c02376 +++$+++ Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
c17203 +++$+++ Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
c08850 +++$+++ Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
c22560 +++$+++ I know.
c07554 +++$+++ Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
c05642 +++$+++ No.  A friend... your mother?  Everybody gets touched by someone they love.
c11760 +++$+++ I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't that funny?  I haven't had a Moonpie since I was ten years old. Right now, I'm thinking how much I'd love one.
c19340 +++$+++ Yes...
c21993 +++$+++ All right, what do you know?
c21838 +++$+++ He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
c18978 +++$+++ It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
c20832 +++$+++ Danny, I can't fucking wait anymore.  You hear me? Now where the fuck's my wife?
c09819 +++$+++ Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
c06360 +++$+++ That's not going to look too good on your service record.
c25549 +++$+++ I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
c12647 +++$+++ I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
c06583 +++$+++ You can't say *that* to--
c26459 +++$+++ N-no, sir?
c06865 +++$+++ We must be here 'cause we stopped.
c21517 +++$+++ The blood transfusion.
c17281 +++$+++ His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
c02385 +++$+++ It's quite nutritious, sir.
c21547 +++$+++ You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
c18802 +++$+++ They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
c20119 +++$+++ Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
c08518 +++$+++ Of course.
c08205 +++$+++ Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
c20004 +++$+++ Yeah, I hated it.
c12184 +++$+++ I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
c16091 +++$+++ Soap?
c07372 +++$+++ Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
c13020 +++$+++ Tell him we're busy.
c15980 +++$+++ Can you give her something?
c21216 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c08724 +++$+++ In the lab.  With her, probably.
c12753 +++$+++ To show them to the UN, right?
c04363 +++$+++ Yeah, that's right.
c10800 +++$+++ I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
c20080 +++$+++ I'm impressed. You're a killer.
c16054 +++$+++ Miss --
c21059 +++$+++ No!
c05568 +++$+++ What shall we do?
c20892 +++$+++ We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
c24229 +++$+++ Sure, King.
c23080 +++$+++ I don't want to. It's different.
c19303 +++$+++ What?
c18171 +++$+++ You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
c25985 +++$+++ Helena --
c04375 +++$+++ Oh yeah? Where?
c05081 +++$+++ It's not worth it. You'll never win.
c25045 +++$+++ I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
c20503 +++$+++ Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
c17527 +++$+++ I love you.
c10878 +++$+++ So she sent you?
c14961 +++$+++ What are those things?
c12051 +++$+++ Don't you think he's using you?
c03543 +++$+++ We could come to my room.
c01205 +++$+++ ...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
c12263 +++$+++ A Black man gave me the message.
c08472 +++$+++ Sounds like a virus.
c26566 +++$+++ Exception!
c05745 +++$+++ If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
c05152 +++$+++ First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
c15318 +++$+++ No.  I don't work here.
c21912 +++$+++ Sam! No!
c14496 +++$+++ I better make a list.
c24561 +++$+++ I gave him this new face.
c06687 +++$+++ Yeah.
c24852 +++$+++ Five years, I think.  Long time.
c10424 +++$+++ And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.  I myself would take it and run like a thief.
c06513 +++$+++ You mean it's dangerous?
c16891 +++$+++ If you say so.  The stripe.
c24008 +++$+++ Isn't he...
c23275 +++$+++ Don't call me dear boy.
c13786 +++$+++ You're not?
c05364 +++$+++ I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
c26178 +++$+++ What?
c08262 +++$+++ But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
c18329 +++$+++ What do you think?
c16405 +++$+++ Did you hear what I just said?!
c18783 +++$+++ You hate to swim.
c02790 +++$+++ Frances, it's me, Harry?
c22073 +++$+++ What about him?
c22735 +++$+++ Okay.  It's good knowing this.
c26365 +++$+++ But he's dead.
c00149 +++$+++ Okay.
c10324 +++$+++ Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
c20433 +++$+++ Then where do we go?!
c00981 +++$+++ I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
c00879 +++$+++ Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump.
c26711 +++$+++ Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
c19541 +++$+++ Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
c23659 +++$+++ Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
c16013 +++$+++ Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
c09111 +++$+++ Retire.
c12484 +++$+++ "Our" car, Walter?
c22717 +++$+++ Hmmm....
c16237 +++$+++ Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
c01912 +++$+++ It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
c12731 +++$+++ Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
c26492 +++$+++ &lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
c05789 +++$+++ It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
c08260 +++$+++ It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
c03386 +++$+++ Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
c13337 +++$+++ What do I gotta do?
c01955 +++$+++ Oh, thanks.
c25387 +++$+++ I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
c10491 +++$+++ He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
c14879 +++$+++ What's wrong with a magic trick?
c03369 +++$+++ Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
c11565 +++$+++ Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
c13152 +++$+++ <u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
c09214 +++$+++ Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
c05973 +++$+++ I wanted to.
c22352 +++$+++ Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
c18199 +++$+++ Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
c11768 +++$+++ This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
c21487 +++$+++ You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
c06723 +++$+++ Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
c00657 +++$+++ And what else?
c21776 +++$+++ I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
c13079 +++$+++ Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
c08115 +++$+++ And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
c03077 +++$+++ About sixty.
c09435 +++$+++ No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
c25343 +++$+++ To be killed in battle?
c25635 +++$+++ You know I don't feel well.
c08322 +++$+++ Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
c13325 +++$+++ Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
c06068 +++$+++ Kinda. Yeah.
c15252 +++$+++ What?
c00405 +++$+++ You okay?
c21107 +++$+++ No.  Are you're leaving?
c17402 +++$+++ Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
c12215 +++$+++ Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
c23756 +++$+++ Sure, around here, any fat old bald guy could be king. I'm nothing. It wouldn't do any good for me to talk to the Congress.  Hey, you thirsty? You like orange whips?
c16027 +++$+++ Because I can hear it.
c05864 +++$+++ Who, for instance?
c02727 +++$+++ What's going on between you two?
c22155 +++$+++ Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
c25991 +++$+++ So does half of San Diego.
c26682 +++$+++ Have you ever done this before?
c16264 +++$+++ You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
c26691 +++$+++ I know...
c22061 +++$+++ I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
c06784 +++$+++ And why are you wearing that silly costume?
c23972 +++$+++ Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
c14543 +++$+++ I'm going to kill him myself!
c26380 +++$+++ What happens when you lose?
c09735 +++$+++ No.
c00582 +++$+++ Why not?
c21719 +++$+++ Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
c13356 +++$+++ You were in the m- You were in the building.
c18916 +++$+++ Compassion.
c20072 +++$+++ You sure you heard what I said?
c02855 +++$+++ You disdain accepted wisdom?
c26861 +++$+++ We had Davy Crockett hats... They made a fortune.
c08676 +++$+++ But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
c05679 +++$+++ You went to Monroe?
c08986 +++$+++ I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
c09809 +++$+++ "Klaatu barada nikto."
c22463 +++$+++ I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source.
c08492 +++$+++ What about the law?
c02492 +++$+++ He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
c04252 +++$+++ He left!
c24196 +++$+++ But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
c05368 +++$+++ I am too old to climb down a rope.
c05479 +++$+++ Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
c08669 +++$+++ What's your twenty?
c12002 +++$+++ Nilsen?
c22416 +++$+++ Last time you needed my help I ended up in the back of a truck.
c22812 +++$+++ It's good to see you involved.
c15547 +++$+++ What about you?
c26194 +++$+++ Get the fuck outta here!
c11933 +++$+++ I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
c20912 +++$+++ Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
c11225 +++$+++ You want to do it?
c00467 +++$+++ There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
c11622 +++$+++ When?
c02154 +++$+++ You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
c19980 +++$+++ So you're a one-girl guy?
c13636 +++$+++ What?
c07155 +++$+++ Not like that. Not like you say.
c21166 +++$+++ None of your business.
c26466 +++$+++ Yeah?
c03196 +++$+++ Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
c00619 +++$+++ With all my heart, Mozart.
c09079 +++$+++ If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana.
c13985 +++$+++ He made an awful lot of money.
c20143 +++$+++ I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
c01160 +++$+++ I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
c16300 +++$+++ Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
c10755 +++$+++ Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
c16085 +++$+++ You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
c16926 +++$+++ He might be ready to chop us up.
c09461 +++$+++ Huh?
c06552 +++$+++ What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
c18696 +++$+++ O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
c23228 +++$+++ Good for you.
c03185 +++$+++ Well, Maxine thinks she can get you a sales job at Computer Station. Normally you have to have references and at least two years of experience, but she thinks she can convince them.
c27423 +++$+++ I thought you wanted to.
c17340 +++$+++ I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
c07123 +++$+++ Sometimes I think that's what you want.
c15635 +++$+++ Why?
c03060 +++$+++ Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
c03335 +++$+++ So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
c05291 +++$+++ You think he's dirty?
c14329 +++$+++ I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
c22238 +++$+++ Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
c00792 +++$+++ I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
c12783 +++$+++ She was.
c09868 +++$+++ He's one of them.
c20378 +++$+++ You know nothing about her!
c04438 +++$+++ I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
c19114 +++$+++ NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
c18326 +++$+++ Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
c06268 +++$+++ Any time. Whenever we want.
c04349 +++$+++ Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
c03881 +++$+++ You should have been a poet.
c13892 +++$+++ I'd like to talk to him.
c22293 +++$+++ I hope you don't mind I took your pack. It was on the table.
c00645 +++$+++ Where?
c00877 +++$+++ Uh, no. There's one...down here.
c11694 +++$+++ You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
c15835 +++$+++ I thought if I could spend that kinda money on a car, it'd mean everything else was fine.  I don't even know how much they cost.
c22365 +++$+++ Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
c01406 +++$+++ I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
c12691 +++$+++ For calling you a homo.
c22587 +++$+++ Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
c26273 +++$+++ Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
c08086 +++$+++ I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
c08023 +++$+++ No, c'mon --
c21073 +++$+++ No...
c02779 +++$+++ Think I'll have a glass.
c17312 +++$+++ Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
c26757 +++$+++ Well... is it so urgent?
c04627 +++$+++ Is there any more rice...?
c00343 +++$+++ You don't get it, he's after me...
c22789 +++$+++ But you'll never get away with it.
c25890 +++$+++ No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
c23885 +++$+++ Beth and Harry?
c02536 +++$+++ Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
c08261 +++$+++ I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
c03420 +++$+++ No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
c01197 +++$+++ Well before there was BLACK or AFRICAN AMERICAN, there were NEGROES.  I'M A NEGRO.
c14999 +++$+++ It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
c18328 +++$+++ -- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
c01707 +++$+++ That sets it off.
c25290 +++$+++ Why?
c14695 +++$+++ I think you have your answer.
c10775 +++$+++ They could eat you.
c21343 +++$+++ You waited til tonight to tell me?
c09958 +++$+++ No. I don't want it to.
c20918 +++$+++ I can't help it.
c12950 +++$+++ You know he would have done you, too.
c09439 +++$+++ A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
c05713 +++$+++ Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
c03105 +++$+++ I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
c23836 +++$+++ Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
c17946 +++$+++ What picture?
c21848 +++$+++ Exactly.  And how long did it run?
c10175 +++$+++ Where did you see that?
c22377 +++$+++ How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
c06526 +++$+++ All I know is--he said to me tonight-- "What does your wife think?" My wife. Thinks we're married--
c12665 +++$+++ Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
c07859 +++$+++ No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
c23490 +++$+++ I crossed paths with him. That's why I'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood.  To make sure I don't run into him again.
c10949 +++$+++ That little old man.
c00207 +++$+++ No class...
c25855 +++$+++ Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
c08713 +++$+++ Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
c13473 +++$+++ That bag's full of fuckin' chips you
c09971 +++$+++ [Beat] I do it.
c23401 +++$+++ I reckon I feel all right.
c10853 +++$+++ I don't know... I don't know...
c17901 +++$+++ Since what?
c01510 +++$+++ Heck, no!  What?!
c06729 +++$+++ Did you carry a gun?
c14309 +++$+++ The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
c14936 +++$+++ Really?  You told your father what you told me?  You let him see your passion for acting?
c20146 +++$+++ Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
c01069 +++$+++ What's this?
c01559 +++$+++ I don't see anything!
c12305 +++$+++ Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
c00799 +++$+++ So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
c17606 +++$+++ We should call the fire department.
c24829 +++$+++ Why?
c06546 +++$+++ Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
c25464 +++$+++ I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
c26867 +++$+++ Yes.
c27428 +++$+++ How?
c09815 +++$+++ But I suppose you know the answer.
c15528 +++$+++ You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
c15027 +++$+++ Well, he's sure working fast ain't he?
c14058 +++$+++ That's what I said.
c16908 +++$+++ I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
c05935 +++$+++ I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
c10289 +++$+++ Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
c15290 +++$+++ You know I do!
c13092 +++$+++ I know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. Terrible about her father, isn't it?
c19402 +++$+++ Thanks.
c14802 +++$+++ You didn't say it.
c21029 +++$+++ Who? Tell me!
c10543 +++$+++ What?  Come on...
c10728 +++$+++ Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
c21813 +++$+++ Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
c13470 +++$+++ It's what you want?
c00045 +++$+++ You 're so --
c23798 +++$+++ Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
c19178 +++$+++ Not exactly a big ocean country.
c12384 +++$+++ Says me. Do you dream often?
c05499 +++$+++ What's the point?  Look at me.
c06395 +++$+++ Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
c15959 +++$+++ When can I have one?
c04075 +++$+++ You're the expert.
c03858 +++$+++ Nice to meet you.
c24729 +++$+++ One of your people told me.
c20390 +++$+++ By whose authority?
c01990 +++$+++ No.
c22561 +++$+++ I'm starting to forget her.
c19293 +++$+++ Buddy Deeds--
c19624 +++$+++ Bullshit.  Bullshit. You know the answer to every goddamn question and I knew the answer to those questions and I'm not half as smart as you are so What Happened?
c01231 +++$+++ Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
c18092 +++$+++ Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
c26527 +++$+++ Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.
c17764 +++$+++ He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
c03871 +++$+++ What were you fighting for?
c05899 +++$+++ Why, mother?
c20389 +++$+++ And that is my last word on the matter.
c18413 +++$+++ I didn't realise.
c25181 +++$+++ I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
c26999 +++$+++ I don't know, but I am.  She was there and then she was gone.  I felt it.
c22944 +++$+++ How do you know all about this?
c21792 +++$+++ I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
c18042 +++$+++ It will not end tonight.
c06155 +++$+++ He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
c17614 +++$+++ I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
c13107 +++$+++ Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
c01702 +++$+++ I think you might of dreamed this one, Anthony.
c20457 +++$+++ Very pleased to meet you.
c13695 +++$+++ Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
c01844 +++$+++ Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
c07183 +++$+++ Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
c11237 +++$+++ Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
c19874 +++$+++ Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
c23408 +++$+++ Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
c19841 +++$+++ Don't promise...just deliver.
c11692 +++$+++ Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
c24699 +++$+++ and totally irrelevant.
c08397 +++$+++ Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
c21660 +++$+++ Very thoughtful.
c08276 +++$+++ That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
c00410 +++$+++ After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
c12188 +++$+++ What happened?!!!
c10835 +++$+++ Why don't you try?
c08125 +++$+++ Where do you keep the can opener?
c11761 +++$+++ I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
c03479 +++$+++ -- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
c16585 +++$+++ Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
c15249 +++$+++ Would you like something to drink?
c14232 +++$+++ It got crashed!  I didn't...
c08872 +++$+++ What radio?
c24146 +++$+++ Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
c09415 +++$+++ Tomorrow?
c22041 +++$+++ Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
c17052 +++$+++ Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
c17534 +++$+++ Good night.
c11123 +++$+++ I don't think I could be.
c23008 +++$+++ The one who came with your letter?
c05485 +++$+++ That's just it -- it would ruin me!
c15593 +++$+++ What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
c17421 +++$+++ But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
c05612 +++$+++ Forty.
c02836 +++$+++ Victor. I love you,
c18756 +++$+++ Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
c21931 +++$+++ That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
c17375 +++$+++ You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
c22631 +++$+++ This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
c06848 +++$+++ Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
c00117 +++$+++ But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
c24614 +++$+++ Yes.
c17110 +++$+++ You know his friends...real animals. And his connections with the police. Sure he'd like us to tell him our plans so he can set us up for the cops and earn their gratitude. Then they would owe him a favor; that's how he operates.  We'll have to pay.  Three hundred, are we agreed?
c02991 +++$+++ No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
c10357 +++$+++ No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
c06934 +++$+++ Didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
c16343 +++$+++ So you're staying in tonight?
c13133 +++$+++ Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
c19258 +++$+++ You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
c08131 +++$+++ All right -- it's said!
c19820 +++$+++ What did she tell you?
c12928 +++$+++ He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
c17060 +++$+++ I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
c09057 +++$+++ I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
c13935 +++$+++ Don't worry. I can recommend a couple. They're expensive but you can afford it.
c23479 +++$+++ I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
c10793 +++$+++ I'm switching off now.
c02792 +++$+++ No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
c21436 +++$+++ What?
c22403 +++$+++ She saved our lives.
c23349 +++$+++ May we look at them now?
c15591 +++$+++ Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
c12841 +++$+++ Oh Jesus.
c03040 +++$+++ I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
c13083 +++$+++ I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler for paper work. Where would we be if we didn't follow the correct procedures?
c05377 +++$+++ I cannot betray my bride.
c19890 +++$+++ Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
c16051 +++$+++ Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
c13198 +++$+++ It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
c11500 +++$+++ Two o'clock.
c14298 +++$+++ I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
c10631 +++$+++ Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
c14994 +++$+++ Biederman, yes.
c26474 +++$+++ Why would the Kid shoot at us?
c09226 +++$+++ No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
c15985 +++$+++ Yes I am her brother, he's the son
c24020 +++$+++ But we...
c18618 +++$+++ A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
c08078 +++$+++ There is no other table --
c05151 +++$+++ No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
c18904 +++$+++ I'll bear that in mind.
c22543 +++$+++ And you're worried about him.
c08450 +++$+++ Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
c02336 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
c05074 +++$+++ Push 'em back.
c09076 +++$+++ We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
c05917 +++$+++ And what's this ... ?
c01521 +++$+++ This is for me.
c07121 +++$+++ Anything.
c17229 +++$+++ Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
c23324 +++$+++ Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
c22146 +++$+++ He got lucky.
c09420 +++$+++ You're money.
c05308 +++$+++ No problem.  We're in.
c00503 +++$+++ Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
c12966 +++$+++ No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
c04435 +++$+++ This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
c01221 +++$+++ My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
c17491 +++$+++ Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
c26821 +++$+++ Is she saying this in Albanian...?
c01451 +++$+++ Why me?
c21308 +++$+++ How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
c22780 +++$+++ Someone who wants to talk to you.
c09451 +++$+++ I'm German-Irish.
c25760 +++$+++ Nice lines--
c21747 +++$+++ Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
c09992 +++$+++ It's nothin' like that.
c08999 +++$+++ A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
c27191 +++$+++ I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
c03322 +++$+++ Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
c01115 +++$+++ Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
c22366 +++$+++ No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
c09036 +++$+++ We deny nothing! We have the right to preserve our race!
c14780 +++$+++ God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
c04546 +++$+++ You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
c15251 +++$+++ Just down the hall.
c18621 +++$+++ You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
c03255 +++$+++ But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
c09369 +++$+++ Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
c02232 +++$+++ You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
c08684 +++$+++ Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
c15832 +++$+++ More than you need me.
c13906 +++$+++ What?
c13994 +++$+++ We haven't heard from him.
c22873 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c21124 +++$+++ "Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
c14330 +++$+++ In fact, by all the laws of physics we know what you claim to have experienced is simply impossible.
c21837 +++$+++ It would take a miracle. Bye!
c11388 +++$+++ Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
c16677 +++$+++ It's your problem.
c17320 +++$+++ Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
c20058 +++$+++ Do you <u>believe</u>...I have forgotten I am a cop?
c22831 +++$+++ What?!
c26169 +++$+++ What do you want to know?
c17291 +++$+++ Anybody!  You understand?
c24425 +++$+++ Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
c25119 +++$+++ Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
c17128 +++$+++ Am I a prisoner?
c25135 +++$+++ I doubt it. How did you find out?
c16600 +++$+++ I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
c14736 +++$+++ Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
c09545 +++$+++ So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
c18787 +++$+++ He could have died.
c08246 +++$+++ It's not a searchlight ---- it's a sword blade cutting the blue cloak of a prince --- not stars --
c22419 +++$+++ Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
c22176 +++$+++ Think about it.
c11738 +++$+++ I've always wanted to learn something like that.
c09356 +++$+++ Koessler?
c20178 +++$+++ Where is it?
c26256 +++$+++ Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
c25218 +++$+++ You called the police?
c01445 +++$+++ This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
c09274 +++$+++ Look, I gotta get some sleep.
c06264 +++$+++ There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
c23232 +++$+++ Thank you.
c07342 +++$+++ Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
c04108 +++$+++ This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
c16198 +++$+++ I had it at four.
c27349 +++$+++ What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
c09910 +++$+++ Don't then have stars where you come from?
c27291 +++$+++ I don't want to be safe!
c06421 +++$+++ Resurrection.
c00116 +++$+++ I took her there for a shower and that's it.
c08773 +++$+++ I can't open it.
c21893 +++$+++ You better run out to the house. She may be... unable to answer the phone...
c22036 +++$+++ All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
c26617 +++$+++ Because I remind you of her?
c07538 +++$+++ The problem is the by-product created by the process.
c08155 +++$+++ That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
c18981 +++$+++ I'm sorry...
c04623 +++$+++ His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
c25145 +++$+++ It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
c08452 +++$+++ Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
c17097 +++$+++ She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
c12382 +++$+++ Fork ah did?
c04577 +++$+++ Then who did?
c09917 +++$+++ Oh, I'm already swooning.
c06295 +++$+++ I have not understood what you means.
c02178 +++$+++ Sir?
c12894 +++$+++ Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
c24497 +++$+++ Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
c05429 +++$+++ How long does this... Mania last?
c10178 +++$+++ Yes. I'll give you that!
c24977 +++$+++ You want to book the flight?
c18305 +++$+++ I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
c08473 +++$+++ Okay.  So he was tall?
c19488 +++$+++ Guess not.
c10731 +++$+++ There's a million birds here.
c16449 +++$+++ What?
c19062 +++$+++ Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
c11713 +++$+++ What?  You think I'm running you up?
c16068 +++$+++ Wow. You ever see her again?
c01884 +++$+++ Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
c23915 +++$+++ I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
c05995 +++$+++ We used to, every summer.
c20747 +++$+++ Tough titty, it's mine now.
c19475 +++$+++ What's that?
c16995 +++$+++ And that'll make me feel better?
c11030 +++$+++ Paved with what, then?
c22654 +++$+++ Again, I thank you.
c04468 +++$+++ This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
c16432 +++$+++ Batteries not included.
c26064 +++$+++ Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
c13607 +++$+++ And what's it like?
c25861 +++$+++ Pretty fun too, isn't it?
c14152 +++$+++ Only kidding...<u>actually</u> I attacked you.
c09793 +++$+++ How does he explain that?
c05682 +++$+++ So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
c02752 +++$+++ ...Don't you?
c05425 +++$+++ No...
c10346 +++$+++ And neither will I.
c01442 +++$+++ I could use some help.  Show me around.  I'll pay you for your time.
c08250 +++$+++ I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
c15077 +++$+++ Yes, why shouldn't it?
c09711 +++$+++ Have we still got power?
c15421 +++$+++ I mean, that worked out.
c03880 +++$+++ Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
c19262 +++$+++ So they stayed in Florida?
c01024 +++$+++ Why?
c01144 +++$+++ Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
c02537 +++$+++ Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
c04938 +++$+++ I'm just tired in general.
c02818 +++$+++ You what?
c12349 +++$+++ Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
c02573 +++$+++ It's complicated...
c04783 +++$+++ I refuse to resign!
c24385 +++$+++ When did he say it, Norma?
c16337 +++$+++ I'll expose you.
c11953 +++$+++ Nope, never watched any. I'm not that interested in the act itself -
c14601 +++$+++ Use it to meditate.  Free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  Do not waste it... for me.
c22401 +++$+++ Get it out of here!
c07791 +++$+++ You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
c05078 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c17269 +++$+++ Buy you a drink?
c23614 +++$+++ What for?
c23518 +++$+++ Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
c26796 +++$+++ Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
c08708 +++$+++ Nah, nuthin' on my end --
c24639 +++$+++ Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
c21595 +++$+++ You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
c12124 +++$+++ Recognition, of course.
c22200 +++$+++ How will you fight Apollo Creed?
c10368 +++$+++ No... No...
c23477 +++$+++ Hi there, little brother.
c06459 +++$+++ That's why I'm here.
c09813 +++$+++ That's what I wanted you to tell me.
c01043 +++$+++ I'm going now, Cole.
c06440 +++$+++ Why? You're the innocent one.
c21015 +++$+++ Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
c03527 +++$+++ Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
c05748 +++$+++ What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
c06998 +++$+++ Then do it through my lawyer!
c13661 +++$+++ Right.
c21507 +++$+++ SULEIMAN!
c03197 +++$+++ It's not optional!
c01338 +++$+++ You can see why it's sensitive?
c01587 +++$+++ I forgot some of my stuff.
c24795 +++$+++ Do you know how to change a tire?
c02189 +++$+++ I know.
c07811 +++$+++ You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
c18711 +++$+++ Kid told me he didn't take it?
c08342 +++$+++ OK. But late.
c26464 +++$+++ Well... I don't recollect.
c25644 +++$+++ Not very encouraging.
c22068 +++$+++ Yeah, but if we don't sit, they'll take our badges.
c16584 +++$+++ Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
c05504 +++$+++ Josh proposed!
c01541 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c25824 +++$+++ Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
c18500 +++$+++ The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
c07537 +++$+++ Why?
c08150 +++$+++ And you're all alone.
c26759 +++$+++ Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
c13776 +++$+++ I thought you'd be pleased.
c19059 +++$+++ The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
c18139 +++$+++ This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
c12689 +++$+++ Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
c00918 +++$+++ Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
c13963 +++$+++ Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
c10583 +++$+++ Here she goes again...
c21303 +++$+++ Don't matter.  I let the monster out, you gonna do what it wants.
c17600 +++$+++ Brady!
c02876 +++$+++ Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
c17143 +++$+++ Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
c24970 +++$+++ I don't understand.
c17205 +++$+++ Do I have any other choice?
c21548 +++$+++ Yeah?
c05875 +++$+++ Yes.
c05653 +++$+++ Oh...with his ear infection!
c00836 +++$+++ Your hairline looks like it's receding.
c05391 +++$+++ He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
c21018 +++$+++ Two?  That's it?
c05571 +++$+++ I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
c16655 +++$+++ Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
c19220 +++$+++ And look what happened to that.
c25203 +++$+++ No!  I would never cheat you.
c00775 +++$+++ The Army can hang him.
c25575 +++$+++ Maybe I do.
c23404 +++$+++ How come her to keep bein' girlfriends and all with him if he's mean to her?
c26232 +++$+++ You were very upset.  You're always very upset in the dream, but I never knew it was you before.
c08333 +++$+++ Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
c24237 +++$+++ Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
c10216 +++$+++ No shit. The Iceman....
c10479 +++$+++ I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
c02053 +++$+++ We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
c11791 +++$+++ Now you're using that word.
c21796 +++$+++ Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
c12304 +++$+++ Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess...  ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
c19770 +++$+++ Ten.
c26489 +++$+++ Yeah?
c16735 +++$+++ I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
c25995 +++$+++ You may speak.
c00746 +++$+++ Looks good. How much did it cost?
c03841 +++$+++ Sounds all right.
c01529 +++$+++ May I please be excused?
c06339 +++$+++ Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
c12532 +++$+++ You don't have to be.
c07264 +++$+++ Well, why'd you shoot him?
c08530 +++$+++ Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
c05898 +++$+++ I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
c07765 +++$+++ An innocent child is dead.
c15625 +++$+++ There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The <u>mob</u>, Bobby!
c19969 +++$+++ Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
c15816 +++$+++ I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
c08281 +++$+++ Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
c03225 +++$+++ Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
c19098 +++$+++ What kind of backup do we have?
c12879 +++$+++ Why do you say that?
c22043 +++$+++ Well, we know you were there. The bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous.
c04014 +++$+++ Anna Moss.
c10681 +++$+++ Jealous? Of me?
c16133 +++$+++ You always call me Miss Brewster.
c06547 +++$+++ Jeff! You're trying to understand in a moment everything about a project that took two years to set up--the reasons--the benefits--
c03275 +++$+++ I-I-I...
c02612 +++$+++ Then what is it?
c06694 +++$+++ Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
c12081 +++$+++ I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
c01412 +++$+++ Why's his britches round his knees?
c14665 +++$+++ Good night Cecile.
c01204 +++$+++ Oh her.
c23542 +++$+++ When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
c20831 +++$+++ Better now.  Where 'you at?
c10011 +++$+++ Taking a shower.
c05400 +++$+++ Where is he? My son.
c21063 +++$+++ You bet, Doc!
c03552 +++$+++ Anyone asked for me?
c09636 +++$+++ Jesus.
c21809 +++$+++ Has it been fifteen minutes?
c09342 +++$+++ You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
c20134 +++$+++ I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck.
c22653 +++$+++ We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
c20603 +++$+++ Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
c27400 +++$+++ What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
c07158 +++$+++ Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back.
c00999 +++$+++ Choices?
c18954 +++$+++ You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
c18443 +++$+++ It's over, I'm telling you...
c06789 +++$+++ Proceed.
c24828 +++$+++ Yeah, I'm Mister Dudley, the caretaker.  What are you doing here?
c11412 +++$+++ I know.
c16052 +++$+++ We're finished.
c00706 +++$+++ Sorry, love.
c06791 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c01487 +++$+++ Dead.
c06664 +++$+++ Prairie? Oysters?
c05845 +++$+++ A paleontologist.
c07031 +++$+++ I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
c19144 +++$+++ The death of my father.
c16460 +++$+++ Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
c21647 +++$+++ You're kind to be so encouraging.
c19595 +++$+++ Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
c12220 +++$+++ Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
c02115 +++$+++ I want to buy a car.
c16175 +++$+++ Right, for us. But...I'm afraid that if you get on that plane...
c15275 +++$+++ She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
c20313 +++$+++ My lady friend has a personality disorder.
c23014 +++$+++ It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
c04483 +++$+++ They want my diary.
c22476 +++$+++ We'll see.
c26845 +++$+++ Yeah...?
c16118 +++$+++ I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
c16697 +++$+++ So, what'd you do about it, Daryl?
c03725 +++$+++ Some kind of animal?
c07807 +++$+++ Why is that, Louis?
c27382 +++$+++ If necessary.
c06474 +++$+++ Death! Thank you!
c14144 +++$+++ That's a virtue isn't it?
c23700 +++$+++ Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
c16031 +++$+++ Two hours ago!
c08016 +++$+++ A man of some travels.
c22965 +++$+++ That's what I said.
c03622 +++$+++ And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
c16549 +++$+++ Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
c17539 +++$+++ Take your time.
c13558 +++$+++ Yes sir.
c07317 +++$+++ Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
c09586 +++$+++ There must be something...
c26605 +++$+++ I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
c27136 +++$+++ Eliminate the competition.
c27282 +++$+++ Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
c04380 +++$+++ Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
c00793 +++$+++ Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
c13247 +++$+++ I'm hungry.
c23054 +++$+++ Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
c11508 +++$+++ As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
c18364 +++$+++ Shit. You're not planning --
c12831 +++$+++ I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
c20982 +++$+++ No.  What's that?
c01316 +++$+++ Come on, Will. Everyone likes that story.
c14777 +++$+++ No. I won't let you do that.
c18989 +++$+++ And what is your present salary?
c05881 +++$+++ I don't know.
c24915 +++$+++ ...I don't think so.
c16661 +++$+++ Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
c01509 +++$+++ Nope.
c19963 +++$+++ How's that, Quince?
c07298 +++$+++ Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
c17391 +++$+++ How was that?
c09351 +++$+++ Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
c16239 +++$+++ As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
c03123 +++$+++ Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
c16291 +++$+++ Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
c11063 +++$+++ I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
c06512 +++$+++ What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
c15529 +++$+++ I got her address.
c26991 +++$+++ It's Madison Fra--
c25026 +++$+++ That would be my guess.
c13270 +++$+++ You look way pretty, Kim.
c21754 +++$+++ Did you?
c10146 +++$+++ -- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
c17315 +++$+++ Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
c20229 +++$+++ Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
c27253 +++$+++ Oh - I'll get it!
c09520 +++$+++ You've got Dickie's rings.
c10719 +++$+++ Beautiful. How's business?
c05155 +++$+++ Wow, dream big!
c25837 +++$+++ I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
c17122 +++$+++ You know otherwise, Freddie?
c22025 +++$+++ Darlin', Rose has got to go!
c26360 +++$+++ Two-hundred dollars?
c11859 +++$+++ That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
c16120 +++$+++ What more proof do you need?
c24886 +++$+++ How we gonna get that lucky?
c05411 +++$+++ I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
c14614 +++$+++ You gotta go now, I bet.
c20064 +++$+++ They had me from the gate.
c09231 +++$+++ I don't know where he is.
c06637 +++$+++ Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
c21034 +++$+++ Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
c18955 +++$+++ You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
c04391 +++$+++ Why?
c25113 +++$+++ But he has been there, off course.
c04851 +++$+++ What about Ruby?
c26962 +++$+++ Relieved?
c01336 +++$+++ That's not a burn.
c04406 +++$+++ Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
c26207 +++$+++ I can, but I don't.
c15266 +++$+++ Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
c05245 +++$+++ I was just getting ready to take a bath.
c22989 +++$+++ What?
c12710 +++$+++ Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
c11733 +++$+++ Oh.  What do you think about?
c19300 +++$+++ Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
c01381 +++$+++ When? Now? Oh. No.
c05671 +++$+++ Sharp.
c18768 +++$+++ No, I air-dry.
c20764 +++$+++ That's my opinion.
c22023 +++$+++ I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
c14662 +++$+++ I was just kidding.
c04417 +++$+++ Only got one kind.
c20954 +++$+++ Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
c24030 +++$+++ She won't stop crying...
c07378 +++$+++ Chills?
c14452 +++$+++ So - why the airport?
c08149 +++$+++ Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
c22300 +++$+++ Gimme a goddamn cigarette!!!!
c15497 +++$+++ Three twenty-five.
c21629 +++$+++ You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
c04876 +++$+++ That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
c06317 +++$+++ A deal?
c26512 +++$+++ I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter than you. I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not.
c19022 +++$+++ C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
c08217 +++$+++ What's he know?
c00140 +++$+++ I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
c24261 +++$+++ Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
c05983 +++$+++ Which one is that?
c05006 +++$+++ Yes.
c16791 +++$+++ Right.
c15827 +++$+++ What?  But you been working so hard --
c14423 +++$+++ You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
c01557 +++$+++ The hotel.
c21075 +++$+++ On what?
c02542 +++$+++ You don't?
c12926 +++$+++ That's all we did, steal their ride.
c25236 +++$+++ They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
c15014 +++$+++ I did. I... This is stolen. I came back.
c15922 +++$+++ I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
c18948 +++$+++ Go down in my room.
c15969 +++$+++ Another one. Had your lunch?
c04447 +++$+++ You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
c19715 +++$+++ In eight days.
c22975 +++$+++ That's the breed...Course it might take time.
c19142 +++$+++ Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
c25084 +++$+++ How will I know you?
c20840 +++$+++ Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
c11446 +++$+++ Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
c12733 +++$+++ He wants me to testify?  Is that what he's asking me to do?
c27376 +++$+++ And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
c08062 +++$+++ Cancer-sucker.
c04179 +++$+++ Is he coming back here?
c26881 +++$+++ The FAA announcement.
c06531 +++$+++ Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
c09647 +++$+++ We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
c07116 +++$+++ Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
c24238 +++$+++ Yeah.
c13425 +++$+++ You make me sick, you fuck. Once a fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.
c22840 +++$+++ Where are you Dewey?
c18727 +++$+++ Which is what?
c12527 +++$+++ I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
c19082 +++$+++ If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
c02660 +++$+++ I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
c05144 +++$+++ You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
c08818 +++$+++ What's this? A cockaroach?
c06853 +++$+++ What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
c03277 +++$+++ Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
c24961 +++$+++ Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
c04560 +++$+++ I don't trust her.
c01431 +++$+++ Give me a break, would you?
c22718 +++$+++ I'll go.
c06959 +++$+++ No more fights.
c07910 +++$+++ Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
c11899 +++$+++ You love him?
c18558 +++$+++ So there's one around here.
c20491 +++$+++ You don't. It's random, there no trick.
c11031 +++$+++ You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
c02391 +++$+++ Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
c10695 +++$+++ I don't believe I know where the upstairs guest room is.
c07744 +++$+++ You have another house somewhere or something?
c26437 +++$+++ We was... lyin'.
c26294 +++$+++ Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
c03843 +++$+++ Com'on, tell me.
c25223 +++$+++ Why is he doing this?
c21394 +++$+++ What about?
c23166 +++$+++ I don't know... Jackie?
c20112 +++$+++ What?
c04410 +++$+++ That is not now, human!
c19489 +++$+++ Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
c25636 +++$+++ He wants me to come to his quarters.
c15989 +++$+++ Little slow tonight.
c07389 +++$+++ What are you doing with the gun?
c03101 +++$+++ Dick Allen's a very dear friend of mine. How far you want to go with this?
c16607 +++$+++ Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be.
c10288 +++$+++ You are so full of shit...
c04420 +++$+++ If we want it, it is.
c13014 +++$+++ -- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
c09784 +++$+++ Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
c23530 +++$+++ Get lost, will you?
c26524 +++$+++ There were no drugs on that boat. It was a hit. A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it. Men he knew he could march into certain death.
c00245 +++$+++ Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
c07575 +++$+++ Oh, is that so?
c13652 +++$+++ Of course. I forgot.
c04170 +++$+++ Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
c15007 +++$+++ You're a fucking nut. You know that, Merle? You're a fucking maniac!
c18016 +++$+++ Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
c07540 +++$+++ Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
c08859 +++$+++ Why do you do this to me every morning?
c01416 +++$+++ Then what?
c07383 +++$+++ He --
c15711 +++$+++ Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
c17705 +++$+++ Oh...
c11683 +++$+++ Cute.
c14565 +++$+++ No shit?
c25560 +++$+++ Well, don't they?
c03901 +++$+++ Yes.
c08099 +++$+++ Shit. I don't remember that at all.
c16386 +++$+++ If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
c04335 +++$+++ How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
c26304 +++$+++ You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
c08870 +++$+++ Why the south latrine?
c02017 +++$+++ When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
c24225 +++$+++ Sorry, King.
c19179 +++$+++ Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
c04419 +++$+++ I'll have to go to a new school -- again.
c05645 +++$+++ She's a little sad, is all.
c02938 +++$+++ I oughtta report you.
c27057 +++$+++ What?
c25578 +++$+++ No.
c10029 +++$+++ What?!  What d'you think?!
c03245 +++$+++ That's not even --
c05226 +++$+++ Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
c14154 +++$+++ Want me to lead?
c03391 +++$+++ Not yet, dear brother...
c00307 +++$+++ His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
c23580 +++$+++ What kind of band is this, anyway?
c18477 +++$+++ Really, this is idiotic!
c16328 +++$+++ Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
c06386 +++$+++ I've been craving that stuff all week.
c19306 +++$+++ How come?
c26965 +++$+++ I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
c14346 +++$+++ You sonofabitch.
c26537 +++$+++ You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
c16703 +++$+++ About what?
c07788 +++$+++ He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
c10497 +++$+++ It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
c01134 +++$+++ The rich kind.  Jeez, man. The way you smoke that shit is suicide.
c22987 +++$+++ Maybe an animal.
c09048 +++$+++ I play the violin... and my chess routines are quite advanced...
c13828 +++$+++ ...man.
c01227 +++$+++ Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
c14537 +++$+++ Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I can replace, but there's a cardboard box... photos of my mother. They're the only ones I have of her.
c01653 +++$+++ I'm sorry, I didn't...
c21309 +++$+++ "Hey, yourself."
c10147 +++$+++ Go ahead.
c20795 +++$+++ Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
c09349 +++$+++ I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
c26130 +++$+++ So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
c06367 +++$+++ You could say something like,  "Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
c11569 +++$+++ Important?
c23059 +++$+++ Now.
c18988 +++$+++ No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
c07289 +++$+++ Her show?
c07314 +++$+++ Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
c11138 +++$+++ '68.
c18670 +++$+++ The females have eggs....
c11203 +++$+++ Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
c26603 +++$+++ I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
c26513 +++$+++ He loved her.
c23137 +++$+++ C'mon, are you or aren't you?
c09641 +++$+++ Exactly.
c11628 +++$+++ I should be checking on the boat.
c24978 +++$+++ What's to see?
c02438 +++$+++ It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
c25274 +++$+++ How... When did you...
c05930 +++$+++ Come on now.  People are smart.
c18304 +++$+++ I wondered about your different accents.  I'm still wondering about your names -- Rand and Holland.
c07772 +++$+++ Do you favor its publication?
c02088 +++$+++ Stand up.
c27073 +++$+++ You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
c19115 +++$+++ I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
c14731 +++$+++ You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
c18907 +++$+++ I could always apply there.
c15927 +++$+++ It is.
c06800 +++$+++ Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
c00372 +++$+++ Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
c04412 +++$+++ You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
c03499 +++$+++ Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
c14410 +++$+++ How did you know they were stockings?
c15709 +++$+++ Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert.  I've found the lost fossils.
c20182 +++$+++ Where?
c12367 +++$+++ No, really.
c16471 +++$+++ What if I was a relative?
c09590 +++$+++ Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
c10490 +++$+++ These look quite fresh.
c25519 +++$+++ He's holding out on you.
c20244 +++$+++ What about Job?
c08846 +++$+++ What's the match gag?
c02963 +++$+++ WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
c04680 +++$+++ What is your husband's profession?
c09578 +++$+++ Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
c19568 +++$+++ -- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
c03160 +++$+++ You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
c25525 +++$+++ I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
c26554 +++$+++ You know...sometimes people can surprise you.  Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
c14321 +++$+++ You mean --
c06010 +++$+++ Bullshit.
c16184 +++$+++ Then say it...just say it to me...!
c00844 +++$+++ It's just not.
c20366 +++$+++ Why?
c23330 +++$+++ 'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
c24382 +++$+++ Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
c01469 +++$+++ Day after tomorrow.
c20618 +++$+++ No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
c12423 +++$+++ Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
c15603 +++$+++ We'd appreciate your cooperation.
c25882 +++$+++ I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
c14535 +++$+++ You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
c13960 +++$+++ They were partners.
c24219 +++$+++ When do you want to arm the bomb for the primary, Major?
c16521 +++$+++ Swimming?
c11826 +++$+++ What if his accomplices have made copies?
c21504 +++$+++ Frightening thought.
c10182 +++$+++ That's true. What are you?
c12250 +++$+++ Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
c20479 +++$+++ No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
c14603 +++$+++ I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
c13310 +++$+++ I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
c18029 +++$+++ Why?
c20022 +++$+++ You're living.
c19168 +++$+++ Yes.
c16923 +++$+++ For exits off Main Street.
c05601 +++$+++ Why?
c20436 +++$+++ And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
c20355 +++$+++ I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
c19046 +++$+++ Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
c15814 +++$+++ And ...?
c03602 +++$+++ It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
c07028 +++$+++ Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
c11150 +++$+++ I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
c02474 +++$+++ Probably see you at the book store.
c04344 +++$+++ Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
c07149 +++$+++ When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
c16392 +++$+++ The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
c17165 +++$+++ He supports me.
c26170 +++$+++ Would you like a bite of my pie?
c13178 +++$+++ I'll speak to you.
c11830 +++$+++ It could help with a new car --
c21732 +++$+++ And why do you say that?
c07602 +++$+++ My mistake - she's glaring.
c22741 +++$+++ No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
c02563 +++$+++ 90 over 50 and falling... .
c14241 +++$+++ I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
c11087 +++$+++ But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
c10056 +++$+++ Stalker, huh?
c17843 +++$+++ Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
c02351 +++$+++ Yes, but I'm not working for you any more.  I'm on the other side.
c04144 +++$+++ If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
c01012 +++$+++ To kill me?
c18671 +++$+++ Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
c08010 +++$+++ What?
c13605 +++$+++ No, of course not, she's a lady.
c12493 +++$+++ And the fucking money!
c09825 +++$+++ Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
c25354 +++$+++ But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
c13106 +++$+++ I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
c22610 +++$+++ Now that's down-right insulting.
c09820 +++$+++ The meanest!
c02977 +++$+++ I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
c19281 +++$+++ Eladio Cruz.
c03279 +++$+++ Right, exactly!
c16093 +++$+++ Long story.
c08654 +++$+++ Seriously?!?
c18246 +++$+++ The C.I. what?  God, no...
c06374 +++$+++ Is it always like this?
c25623 +++$+++ You really think there's a treasure inside?
c18881 +++$+++ I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
c11139 +++$+++ --she was really paranoid, the bookkeeper.
c03928 +++$+++ Yes?
c08517 +++$+++ Nah!  What's he got? This is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. It's not the money. Not for you. Why can't I get ahold of it?  Cobb says there's no telling what you're going to care about.
c14139 +++$+++ The money!
c19401 +++$+++ Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
c22519 +++$+++ It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
c16148 +++$+++ Why Jack?
c05608 +++$+++ How's your wife?
c17393 +++$+++ Do you keep in touch with them?
c18944 +++$+++ No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
c13649 +++$+++ He's all right.
c14156 +++$+++ I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
c06542 +++$+++ I addressed the Chair first, sir!
c16824 +++$+++ She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
c25591 +++$+++ How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
c26338 +++$+++ Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
c06676 +++$+++ Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
c12042 +++$+++ Good.
c14737 +++$+++ Will you come soon?
c18339 +++$+++ Well dad, actually I thought I'd take the morning train on Thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying, papers, you know, lab experiments --
c10168 +++$+++ No, that was Leavenworth. This --  was Sioux Falls. What ya want?
c01573 +++$+++ Then after that it's safe.
c12916 +++$+++ No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
c03141 +++$+++ Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
c10588 +++$+++ There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
c23299 +++$+++ Like this place?
c16364 +++$+++ Delivered from Martha Stewart.
c09260 +++$+++ He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
c13458 +++$+++ Hi, how are you?
c05354 +++$+++ Nothing.
c03675 +++$+++ The serial killer?
c12062 +++$+++ I need this?
c16444 +++$+++ I know.  I go with you.
c24572 +++$+++ They just finished supper.
c21895 +++$+++ Forty thousand dollars.
c08434 +++$+++ What the fuck!
c03412 +++$+++ Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
c13894 +++$+++ No. It was an accident.
c12721 +++$+++ I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
c10707 +++$+++ And what did you say?
c01208 +++$+++ I slept too near where I fell out.
c11499 +++$+++ I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
c10656 +++$+++ Her dog, yes.
c13432 +++$+++ That's amazing.
c18421 +++$+++ So you felt it too!
c22722 +++$+++ That's cool then.
c26151 +++$+++ Are you a total lying, scumsucking pig Harry?
c15023 +++$+++ Six or eight.  And they go wild?
c23066 +++$+++ Yeah?
c21551 +++$+++ What you got there - beers?
c20261 +++$+++ You haven't said anything.
c08585 +++$+++ Don't step in the horse manure.
c19664 +++$+++ Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
c05445 +++$+++ You'll probably be bigger than your brothers.
c13188 +++$+++ 'Really a lot appreciate it...'
c20221 +++$+++ What?
c17510 +++$+++ Fine!
c13015 +++$+++ He run away often?
c22940 +++$+++ Sorry about that... I just...
c24974 +++$+++ What was it?
c13237 +++$+++ Well I'm overjoyed.
c15208 +++$+++ I hope the block is still standing.
c01419 +++$+++ You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
c08315 +++$+++ No, but I did.
c08598 +++$+++ What?
c06187 +++$+++ Good things happen, too, Creasy.  Like meeting me.
c18065 +++$+++ You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
c08772 +++$+++ You could do better.
c22643 +++$+++ Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
c03971 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c03157 +++$+++ What is it?
c00789 +++$+++ Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
c04204 +++$+++ I did.  Hold the wire.
c24183 +++$+++ So what?
c21102 +++$+++ What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
c01398 +++$+++ Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
c23475 +++$+++ The name is Cyrus Cole.
c23121 +++$+++ I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
c07398 +++$+++ Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
c03018 +++$+++ We.. We lie.
c11753 +++$+++ I'm not normal.
c06451 +++$+++ Boss, I got all the time you need.
c21399 +++$+++ Why not? They're my favorite.
c10581 +++$+++ In a fire, as I recall.
c22846 +++$+++ And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
c02807 +++$+++ What?
c07489 +++$+++ It doesn't!
c14670 +++$+++ She bought it.
c06278 +++$+++ You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
c25193 +++$+++ You're the best, Enzo!
c13288 +++$+++ Football is my life.
c20295 +++$+++ WHAT?
c25499 +++$+++ Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
c11287 +++$+++ Well, then, w-who was?
c01247 +++$+++ Yes, he's fine.
c23751 +++$+++ - canker sore.
c07250 +++$+++ What? Where was he?!
c04897 +++$+++ Won't forget?
c06304 +++$+++ Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
c15860 +++$+++ Now you're making sense.
c09865 +++$+++ Get your gear on.
c22798 +++$+++ Just for you, Sid.
c15757 +++$+++ The eight billion. From them to us.
c01413 +++$+++ Or what?
c07661 +++$+++ Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
c00153 +++$+++ No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
c08012 +++$+++ Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
c19726 +++$+++ 3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
c26864 +++$+++ Jim Belushi...?
c04910 +++$+++ No, you didn't. What branch?
c03673 +++$+++ What are you looking at?
c22407 +++$+++ Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
c24489 +++$+++ No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
c02518 +++$+++ I know. Anyway --
c02462 +++$+++ No... he's not... not... there...
c19752 +++$+++ Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.
c26483 +++$+++ Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
c25655 +++$+++ Yes...
c27276 +++$+++ Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I've heard them all.
c25494 +++$+++ Is that what it means?
c13147 +++$+++ To the pan of the supplies boxes --
c22941 +++$+++ We don't know for sure...
c10172 +++$+++ What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
c08057 +++$+++ How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
c10678 +++$+++ When we fall, we fall hard.
c18288 +++$+++ Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
c09997 +++$+++ We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
c08475 +++$+++ See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
c16762 +++$+++ That's debatable.
c22254 +++$+++ Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
c22275 +++$+++ Sent it where?
c14677 +++$+++ I'll think about it...
c00568 +++$+++ No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
c15451 +++$+++ Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
c16656 +++$+++ Yeah, go on...
c15610 +++$+++ "At the center of the investigation are well-known Washington-area attorneys Robert Dean and Rachel Banks."
c15899 +++$+++ Defense against what?
c04192 +++$+++ I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
c12482 +++$+++ Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
c04781 +++$+++ You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you--
c07590 +++$+++ What are you doing fooling around in here?
c13445 +++$+++ I understand.
c17742 +++$+++ Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
c07840 +++$+++ Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
c20326 +++$+++ Well, how did you become king, then?
c08270 +++$+++ I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
c15270 +++$+++ Good one, Captain Rob. He does look like a you-know-what.
c26192 +++$+++ I'm her husband.
c23515 +++$+++ And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
c15190 +++$+++ Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.
c04964 +++$+++ They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
c20533 +++$+++ Can I see him?
c16158 +++$+++ We bowl together. We're bowlers ...we won a championship...we're winners.
c12857 +++$+++ No, really?
c05141 +++$+++ Leah just told me you were going with her.
c06056 +++$+++ Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
c27014 +++$+++ Explain this to me --- violated...?
c01452 +++$+++ He killed a police officer.
c05447 +++$+++ Perhaps there's another route?
c19250 +++$+++ You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
c01370 +++$+++ Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
c18082 +++$+++ He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
c16288 +++$+++ Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
c27321 +++$+++ That's because --
c21397 +++$+++ What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
c15444 +++$+++ Okay.
c23214 +++$+++ Steve?
c21420 +++$+++ What do they do up there?
c18397 +++$+++ She wouldn't tell me!
c22060 +++$+++ What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
c14228 +++$+++ By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
c13031 +++$+++ What do I have to do.
c11786 +++$+++ No, not if you've got better things to do.
c11229 +++$+++ What?
c13401 +++$+++ Why're you crying?
c14814 +++$+++ You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
c02397 +++$+++ Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
c11727 +++$+++ How?
c11072 +++$+++ What did you expect - live sables?
c02812 +++$+++ Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
c12930 +++$+++ Why not?  He eats everything else.
c16744 +++$+++ We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
c26948 +++$+++ And then you weren't there.
c20312 +++$+++ Do you have a girlfriend?
c07841 +++$+++ You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
c18730 +++$+++ Why?
c01185 +++$+++ That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
c16162 +++$+++ I've got everything I need.
c21857 +++$+++ Then the Department of Justice owns 100% of Bialystock and Bloom.
c08154 +++$+++ Because there's a man I want to see.
c26710 +++$+++ Easy Micheal.
c14022 +++$+++ I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
c23077 +++$+++ Yes.
c06685 +++$+++ No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
c23346 +++$+++ Bring him.
c04973 +++$+++ No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
c22826 +++$+++ I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
c14465 +++$+++ I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
c09939 +++$+++ How?
c26507 +++$+++ He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
c02427 +++$+++ But you don't realize....
c14547 +++$+++ Why haven't you turned us in?
c17390 +++$+++ Yes you were.
c01619 +++$+++ Come on Dorothy.
c22556 +++$+++ I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
c04314 +++$+++ God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
c01415 +++$+++ You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
c19130 +++$+++ Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
c21950 +++$+++ That's the way I feel about it.
c03348 +++$+++ You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
c04579 +++$+++ Dinner...tonight.
c05593 +++$+++ Red.
c07741 +++$+++ Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
c13471 +++$+++ What about my money?
c24042 +++$+++ My wife is going to have a baby, and...
c15936 +++$+++ Oh circuit my ass, he doesn't give a shit!
c26248 +++$+++ What...???
c13179 +++$+++ Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
c16699 +++$+++ We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
c20890 +++$+++ Anita!
c03689 +++$+++ Halloween.
c12724 +++$+++ Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
c11704 +++$+++ Rot in hell, Melvin.
c06999 +++$+++ This is a place for workmen.
c19328 +++$+++ No--
c15828 +++$+++ No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
c17658 +++$+++ ...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
c24145 +++$+++ Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
c16620 +++$+++ Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
c16614 +++$+++ But I've seen the deed.
c02908 +++$+++ We are?
c05451 +++$+++ You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
c05957 +++$+++ Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
c13904 +++$+++ Iced tea.
c09182 +++$+++ They will obey, Praetor.
c20185 +++$+++ ..or hard wired..
c04595 +++$+++ Maybe they're expecting Gruner. I'm gonna be him.
c09610 +++$+++ No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
c14124 +++$+++ A fine, for five hundred dollars.
c11425 +++$+++ Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
c10487 +++$+++ Like Freddy.
c05527 +++$+++ To be my bride, of course.
c03517 +++$+++ It was nothing to do with you, sir.
c15963 +++$+++ I wouldn't talk.
c22849 +++$+++ Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
c20299 +++$+++ Did he tell her?
c14630 +++$+++ Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
c05538 +++$+++ True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
c04912 +++$+++ That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
c16657 +++$+++ Who's my real father, man?
c23308 +++$+++ I don't want to mess anyone up...
c01605 +++$+++ Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
c20719 +++$+++ I have to go. He sighs.
c02706 +++$+++ There's no choice. I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife!
c01973 +++$+++ If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
c12023 +++$+++ I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
c00650 +++$+++ How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
c23393 +++$+++ Leave.
c16320 +++$+++ They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
c03541 +++$+++ Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
c22719 +++$+++ Goodbye.
c26104 +++$+++ Cute.
c15320 +++$+++ I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
c05298 +++$+++ You'll find her.
c03328 +++$+++ I'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd babysit.  Do you want to babysit with me?
c05405 +++$+++ Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
c02503 +++$+++ Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
c18975 +++$+++ Yeah?
c04692 +++$+++ No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
c19408 +++$+++ Yeah.
c08521 +++$+++ I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
c05373 +++$+++ What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
c20692 +++$+++ Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
c18433 +++$+++ It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
c21906 +++$+++ Huh?
c01983 +++$+++ Oh?  You've tried?
c08371 +++$+++ F for...
c14729 +++$+++ This is more fun than just pretend.
c01614 +++$+++ I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
c19738 +++$+++ Blue is cold.
c10123 +++$+++ I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
c15321 +++$+++ Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
c25038 +++$+++ Where would they be going?
c06031 +++$+++ Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
c16839 +++$+++ But the son is suppose to stop crying.
c13782 +++$+++ She works at a church?
c08408 +++$+++ No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
c17530 +++$+++ What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
c20049 +++$+++ Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
c25422 +++$+++ You're a dirty pig!
c08791 +++$+++ Did you hear what I said?
c23388 +++$+++ You know better than that. We're on duty. Catch me in that Camaro next week one night.
c24626 +++$+++ You remember this?
c22930 +++$+++ Drop it.
c08113 +++$+++ You gotta idea, spit it out.
c03010 +++$+++ It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
c17457 +++$+++ And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
c13087 +++$+++ I don't think a week's gonna do it.
c22744 +++$+++ How ya doing?  Is she around?
c05348 +++$+++ I know it was bad.
c26213 +++$+++ I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
c10990 +++$+++ We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
c27088 +++$+++ That's a crappy thing to say.
c21942 +++$+++ That called ... commanded ...
c06089 +++$+++ You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
c26928 +++$+++ Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.
c25027 +++$+++ I told you -- he and I were old friends --
c06232 +++$+++ So I'll call you tomorrow.

c16952 +++$+++ Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
c02985 +++$+++ But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
c10188 +++$+++ Why?
c25603 +++$+++ What if he's not?
c00839 +++$+++ But where?
c06328 +++$+++ A what?
c07680 +++$+++ Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
c09031 +++$+++ Two?
c19166 +++$+++ Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men.
c00604 +++$+++ Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
c01366 +++$+++ You are throwing me out.
c05207 +++$+++ How many times you gonna tell me that?
c20166 +++$+++ That's nice.
c12487 +++$+++ Now Dude--
c10752 +++$+++ You seem a little hostile today.
c09083 +++$+++ It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
c25047 +++$+++ Is she alive?
c14580 +++$+++ Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
c02803 +++$+++ 'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
c26688 +++$+++ Later.
c17199 +++$+++ You asked me to model.  Remember?
c06471 +++$+++ Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
c05244 +++$+++ Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
c07050 +++$+++ The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
c27106 +++$+++ The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
c17361 +++$+++ You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
c00653 +++$+++ I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
c12672 +++$+++ Nothing. I'm fine.
c02223 +++$+++ Tell everybody hey.
c03332 +++$+++ They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
c18062 +++$+++ We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
c14106 +++$+++ So I'm told.
c19297 +++$+++ Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
c13681 +++$+++ And you know what?
c19905 +++$+++ No, no.  I on holiday.
c22595 +++$+++ Be still ...
c00899 +++$+++ They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
c26429 +++$+++ No.
c09882 +++$+++ I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
c27063 +++$+++ Oh. Well. Maybe not yet.
c04777 +++$+++ Like this. I have no robe.
c02247 +++$+++ I said, I'm sorry!
c09940 +++$+++ The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
c06877 +++$+++ For not believing you.
c06755 +++$+++ I'm staying.
c25784 +++$+++ If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
c16042 +++$+++ Fuck you.
c00377 +++$+++ How'd you get the job?
c07817 +++$+++ love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
c11861 +++$+++ Materially or spiritually?
c07816 +++$+++ Sir, I-
c20298 +++$+++ I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
c09498 +++$+++ Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
c16648 +++$+++ Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
c16632 +++$+++ What...
c03774 +++$+++ What does he say to do?
c16347 +++$+++ You feel nothing?
c00805 +++$+++ Stop it. This is just sad.
c00953 +++$+++ Be careful.
c22126 +++$+++ No no no, no no.
c16780 +++$+++ Randy, c'mon!
c07777 +++$+++ It was not inspired by circumstance.
c19141 +++$+++ I don't know. Is it?
c16216 +++$+++ Ben's still out there --
c00870 +++$+++ Oh no, I'm okay.
c12309 +++$+++ 1952...?
c13626 +++$+++ Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
c25956 +++$+++ You are a liar!
c19782 +++$+++ And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
c23944 +++$+++ Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
c09890 +++$+++ Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
c27074 +++$+++ Sometimes you have to do stuff you don't want to do. It's all part of growing up. And it usually works out peachy in the end.
c18533 +++$+++ Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
c17591 +++$+++ So?
c04050 +++$+++ Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
c14689 +++$+++ I want to fuck.
c17168 +++$+++ Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
c01758 +++$+++ What did I say?
c08226 +++$+++ I'm afraid she can't do that, Ward. It would endanger her.
c16672 +++$+++ Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
c26679 +++$+++ That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
c25963 +++$+++ It was only a mouthful!
c17722 +++$+++ You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
c06053 +++$+++ We're here representing Max. You're acting like a Puerto Rican on the fifteenth of the month.
c02184 +++$+++ And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
c02464 +++$+++ Yeah.
c17075 +++$+++ "'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
c19341 +++$+++ And are you afraid?
c14754 +++$+++ I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
c19374 +++$+++ And you believed him?
c26666 +++$+++ If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
c24590 +++$+++ Anything you didn't understand?
c23709 +++$+++ Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
c01323 +++$+++ How did you get so many?
c08121 +++$+++ Look of things, she doesn't.
c20642 +++$+++ Where's your bike?
c02431 +++$+++ Of course not... but... when I was a child... I remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
c20406 +++$+++ The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
c13456 +++$+++ I understand.
c24383 +++$+++ It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
c27441 +++$+++ MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
c08445 +++$+++ Sure.
c04527 +++$+++ I told you, my name is Al.
c21607 +++$+++ Round of golf Saturday?
c05476 +++$+++ What did they look like?
c16968 +++$+++ Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
c00406 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c12416 +++$+++ In case of what?
c02317 +++$+++ Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
c26831 +++$+++ Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
c24559 +++$+++ Where do you hail from?
c23714 +++$+++ Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
c20901 +++$+++ It was a long time ago -
c02432 +++$+++ Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
c22494 +++$+++ No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
c19760 +++$+++ B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
c02361 +++$+++ Bah!!
c00723 +++$+++ That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
c01931 +++$+++ Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
c23476 +++$+++ You named the kid after yourself, huh?
c17802 +++$+++ ...might I make a suggestion...?
c12265 +++$+++ Fine. They felt that since you had such close ties with the President, you would be a splendid choice.  ... Can I help you? Are you looking for something?
c06041 +++$+++ I'll page you with the number.
c08966 +++$+++ They're still running with shields down.
c09721 +++$+++ Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
c15439 +++$+++ Oh yeah.
c26996 +++$+++ I never asked you to quit!
c08420 +++$+++ You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
c26229 +++$+++ I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
c21132 +++$+++ Is he looking at us?
c19693 +++$+++ We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
c18614 +++$+++ You don't have to prove anything.
c02327 +++$+++ The bitch.
c04146 +++$+++ All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
c07558 +++$+++ Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me--
c18468 +++$+++ How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
c10696 +++$+++ No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
c12601 +++$+++ What do you think?
c16834 +++$+++ I'm glad we're having this talk.
c20884 +++$+++ No Roger from op/ed?
c09243 +++$+++ I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
c21366 +++$+++ I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
c24355 +++$+++ Twenty-two.
c11311 +++$+++ Don't you think I do?
c19566 +++$+++ C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
c07095 +++$+++ No, Henry.  I don't.
c08677 +++$+++ What's your twenty and what's your handle?
c10934 +++$+++ Go away! You've spoilt it.
c03065 +++$+++ Capture them?  Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
c14804 +++$+++ NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
c26969 +++$+++ Wanna fool around?
c03182 +++$+++ Fifteen, at the most.
c11441 +++$+++ That's not an answer, is it?
c12619 +++$+++ Hello, daddy.
c05487 +++$+++ But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
c02176 +++$+++ What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
c04322 +++$+++ You really enjoy my company?
c14613 +++$+++ Does she have a name?
c16850 +++$+++ They're my team.
c06340 +++$+++ Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started--
c10629 +++$+++ Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
c26418 +++$+++ Skeptical about what?
c10078 +++$+++ Jai alai?
c01124 +++$+++ What the hell was it doing in the fire?
c07804 +++$+++ In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
c05250 +++$+++ No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
c25511 +++$+++ Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
c06042 +++$+++ Fuck them.
c09347 +++$+++ Of course not. They're possibles. I've checked them against Bureau records, check them against your file. How did you get it?
c03919 +++$+++ Reliquary --
c14415 +++$+++ Why should I trust you?
c18473 +++$+++ What is it -- what are you talking about?
c25425 +++$+++ Szpilman.
c02364 +++$+++ Your Excellency!
c05518 +++$+++ You got into Harvard Law?
c23562 +++$+++ Will she be surprised. I just can't wait to see her face -
c02543 +++$+++ About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
c20613 +++$+++ Can I go too?
c26003 +++$+++ Fine, then we don't have deal.
c13319 +++$+++ And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
c06260 +++$+++ I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
c01708 +++$+++ There's another stocker, right?
c24777 +++$+++ They did the same to him as they did to you.
c21014 +++$+++ No, sir.
c17284 +++$+++ Because you should be home with Nintendo, listening to The Spice Girls, little man ...
c23676 +++$+++ What... are you?
c06914 +++$+++ You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
c27318 +++$+++ I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
c19470 +++$+++ I know.  But chances are...
c10844 +++$+++ Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
c21826 +++$+++ I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
c01214 +++$+++ You can go now.
c08223 +++$+++ Then, you also understand that you must die.
c04602 +++$+++ Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
c12337 +++$+++ I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
c18465 +++$+++ He leave you?
c03449 +++$+++ Yes, I will.
c04589 +++$+++ Hiroshima.
c03317 +++$+++ Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
c15671 +++$+++ It's beautiful.  What's it about?
c09361 +++$+++ What kind of car do you drive?
c04443 +++$+++ A countdown to what?
c22644 +++$+++ For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
c03035 +++$+++ And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
c10473 +++$+++ I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
c26288 +++$+++ I got it.
c26712 +++$+++ Are we supposed to?
c20532 +++$+++ I love you too sweetie, bye.
c08116 +++$+++ Well that's that, then. I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibilities already. But now he knows:  what you look like,  what your first name is,  where you're from and  what your specialty is. They ain't gonna hafta show him a helluva lot of pictures for him to pick you out. That's it right, you didn't tell him anything else that could narrow down the selection?
c18663 +++$+++ They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
c09291 +++$+++ Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
c05246 +++$+++ Yeah. Come on.
c00747 +++$+++ Well, I--
c18090 +++$+++ Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
c27172 +++$+++ All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
c06055 +++$+++ I mean, that's what I heard --
c21774 +++$+++ I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
c21165 +++$+++ I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
c16009 +++$+++ What're you talking about?
c16905 +++$+++ Who are they?
c12972 +++$+++ Yeah.
c20668 +++$+++ Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
c09199 +++$+++ You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
c07166 +++$+++ Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
c06812 +++$+++ Thank you.
c06630 +++$+++ How do you do.
c15777 +++$+++ You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
c07310 +++$+++ Hot damn, we gotta find those boys! Sign 'em to a big fat contract! Hell's bells, Mr. Lunn, if we don't the goddamn competition will!
c11928 +++$+++ Believe in Penny Priddy?
c20625 +++$+++ Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
c02444 +++$+++ She got me thinking...
c25470 +++$+++ I'll square it with the fixer.
c07945 +++$+++ You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
c24407 +++$+++ You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
c15723 +++$+++ You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
c10538 +++$+++ Oh, really?
c11136 +++$+++ Were you eyebrow reading?
c04262 +++$+++ I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
c19189 +++$+++ Do it.
c16998 +++$+++ Oh, you've been watching television.
c09973 +++$+++ Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
c12356 +++$+++ With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
c04313 +++$+++ But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
c16602 +++$+++ Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
c03219 +++$+++ Not really...
c13814 +++$+++ There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
c19884 +++$+++ Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
c26260 +++$+++ Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
c20042 +++$+++ Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
c01352 +++$+++ Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
c07449 +++$+++ And your principles?
c12750 +++$+++ I don't even know your name yet ...
c03021 +++$+++ He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
c03382 +++$+++ You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
c17504 +++$+++ You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
c01206 +++$+++ I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
c08311 +++$+++ Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
c21442 +++$+++ Not unnecessary ones.
c06858 +++$+++ Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
c25174 +++$+++ Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
c22734 +++$+++ How can I look at you and say this?
c02335 +++$+++ I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
c23529 +++$+++ Such as?
c05166 +++$+++ I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
c16840 +++$+++ I lost it. I lose everything.
c27334 +++$+++ Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
c26434 +++$+++ Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
c16223 +++$+++ The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
c07030 +++$+++ Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
c05109 +++$+++ Just a favor for your old man.
c08195 +++$+++ Alright, but I ain't drinking. and you're gonna have to look after me.
c19248 +++$+++ You're dismissed.
c14527 +++$+++ Where did they go?
c19857 +++$+++ About that shooting last night...I was there and...
c21994 +++$+++ Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
c10539 +++$+++ Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
c16959 +++$+++ Confidential, like.
c27279 +++$+++ ...yes?...
c19925 +++$+++ And is your heart beating strangely?
c21908 +++$+++ What makes you sound so certain?
c00344 +++$+++ There you go.  Love you.
c19358 +++$+++ Maybe I just bought it.
c03577 +++$+++ You see -- what we are interested in --
c15852 +++$+++ With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
c11984 +++$+++ Because you didn't love him --
c18900 +++$+++ -- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
c16630 +++$+++ Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt.
c21593 +++$+++ We try to be decent.
c27332 +++$+++ What about you?
c24281 +++$+++ I, yeah.
c24252 +++$+++ Come on. Inside.
c05902 +++$+++ Thank you.
c07360 +++$+++ Get the fuck away from me.
c21603 +++$+++ Got the information on you?
c19623 +++$+++ You coulda been in front --
c27424 +++$+++ Wockers with the knockers???
c19468 +++$+++ They ever love you back?
c18253 +++$+++ I'm supposed to fall for that?
c05948 +++$+++ Kill type?
c26801 +++$+++ It's the White House.
c03981 +++$+++ Call me tomorrow.
c11998 +++$+++ No.
c01457 +++$+++ You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
c09419 +++$+++ ...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
c23958 +++$+++ Hold station.
c07245 +++$+++ Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
c00878 +++$+++ So...you hang out here a lot?
c14188 +++$+++ Murder, sir.
c26456 +++$+++ They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
c04002 +++$+++ Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
c12506 +++$+++ He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
c06670 +++$+++ An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
c16519 +++$+++ With applesauce?
c27448 +++$+++ Oh, a little.  But it's not just physical loneliness.  It's the pangs that come from missing someone intellectually... as I have you.
c19044 +++$+++ The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
c17072 +++$+++ Call up the bank.  I called them.
c21582 +++$+++ I told you my father died in jail. He stole a fortune.  Most of it pretty dirty money.  I don't care to have that known.
c10143 +++$+++ You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
c15101 +++$+++ Most outlandish thing I ever heard tell.  Don't seem right, somehow!
c00535 +++$+++ Yeah, I heard of it.
c18824 +++$+++ They are?  I'll be damned.
c21111 +++$+++ Very funny.
c14598 +++$+++ Then, why did you come?
c22833 +++$+++ Nope.
c11449 +++$+++ But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
c02257 +++$+++ Not if you chose to stay within God's channel...
c14715 +++$+++ You're shouting at me.
c13007 +++$+++ -- let me do this, okay? --
c27355 +++$+++ Go to hell!
c05263 +++$+++ You didn't?
c18166 +++$+++ -- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
c06489 +++$+++ The ring...
c05206 +++$+++ What'll we do out there?
c15676 +++$+++ Don't leave me!
c26742 +++$+++ We will.
c04219 +++$+++ They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
c00223 +++$+++ No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
c05958 +++$+++ You don't have to do this, Chief.
c05702 +++$+++ That's the way it is.
c18762 +++$+++ Call me tomorrow.
c24972 +++$+++ I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
c11034 +++$+++ You have no right to say such things!
c08852 +++$+++ What are the chances busting out of here?
c01860 +++$+++ It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
c11502 +++$+++ They had to pump it out.
c19543 +++$+++ Honey.
c06936 +++$+++ Answer me!
c14918 +++$+++ It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
c13490 +++$+++ You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy.
c17019 +++$+++ Yes.
c26850 +++$+++ Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
c05154 +++$+++ You don't know anything about me!
c09446 +++$+++ No, and I've been calling all night. Maybe he's shacked up.
c15660 +++$+++ Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
c25409 +++$+++ wish I knew you better.
c19675 +++$+++ Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
c02554 +++$+++ The containment, Second Containment...
c12137 +++$+++ So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
c03779 +++$+++ If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
c10519 +++$+++ What was that?
c10109 +++$+++ What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
c26985 +++$+++ This is the Feur thing?
c23409 +++$+++ I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
c19013 +++$+++ Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
c08157 +++$+++ Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
c10295 +++$+++ And the one on the right is the bullet you test-fired from Shu's gun?
c09859 +++$+++ Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
c00457 +++$+++ Where's my family?
c06227 +++$+++ Actually, I don't make friends easily.
c19766 +++$+++ Really?
c26421 +++$+++ I don't know what you're asking?
c18201 +++$+++ Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
c04701 +++$+++ Miles? You're scaring me.
c20900 +++$+++ Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
c11480 +++$+++ It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
c13258 +++$+++ Where are you gonna go?
c01248 +++$+++ The milkmaid's daughter?
c15010 +++$+++ Hunt with Vince?
c26469 +++$+++ Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
c21612 +++$+++ I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
c05767 +++$+++ It's different now. Help me.
c23367 +++$+++ Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic.
c00689 +++$+++ You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
c18796 +++$+++ Why?
c27270 +++$+++ To Oz?
c04392 +++$+++ Okay. So what's your name today?
c26912 +++$+++ You were never that innocent sugarpie.
c26357 +++$+++ You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
c21105 +++$+++ Nice dress.
c21196 +++$+++ You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
c02595 +++$+++ It's easy for you to be patient.
c20581 +++$+++ This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
c23579 +++$+++ Good!  Then you won't be needing your car.
c08748 +++$+++ It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
c14992 +++$+++ Kind of. You didn't know?
c11094 +++$+++ I wish I could believe that.
c26241 +++$+++ You... you left them a message?
c06691 +++$+++ That's it? That's what you're giving me?
c19171 +++$+++ Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
c14209 +++$+++ Bottega.
c24968 +++$+++ With a DNA analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  You aren't here for a lesson in DNA.
c13730 +++$+++ But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
c13983 +++$+++ You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
c26851 +++$+++ The Albanian Campaign.
c04450 +++$+++ You punched the President in the face?
c12408 +++$+++ YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
c02919 +++$+++ So.  We're still coming to terms with the exact protocol for this -- for integrating the Spec-Recon training.  It may not always be smooth, but we're trying to make it as painless as possible for you.
c05386 +++$+++ Can't I come, too?
c19462 +++$+++ Huh?
c24856 +++$+++ He's gotta know why.
c26393 +++$+++ Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
c20231 +++$+++ We've lost enough agents for one night.
c19092 +++$+++ Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
c00378 +++$+++ Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
c22021 +++$+++ You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
c27198 +++$+++ Who??
c27204 +++$+++ Have you got your gun on now?
c09183 +++$+++ But surely...
c07103 +++$+++ Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've always believed that.
c07097 +++$+++ I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
c06417 +++$+++ But I don't know anything about programming.
c01688 +++$+++ What are you serious?
c17370 +++$+++ Watch your mouth.
c07451 +++$+++ I am, I think.
c06036 +++$+++ Understand me?
c27131 +++$+++ Try, Kelly.
c06987 +++$+++ Or a tunnel or a bridge...
c17932 +++$+++ Mister LaPlante...
c17330 +++$+++ Holy shit.
c26689 +++$+++ No. I think it's fucked.
c25227 +++$+++ From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
c12858 +++$+++ Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
c18185 +++$+++ Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
c25711 +++$+++ Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
c14278 +++$+++ You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
c20443 +++$+++ Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
c06115 +++$+++ How do you like it?
c01888 +++$+++ None taken. Hey, uh, does Kayleigh Miller still work here?
c03033 +++$+++ What?  What are you talking about?
c05128 +++$+++ Yep.
c11212 +++$+++ Thank you, dad, I got it.
c11927 +++$+++ Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
c07665 +++$+++ No. You baked them for Whitey.
c09012 +++$+++ ... Who are you?
c15244 +++$+++ We don't know nuthin' else.
c23517 +++$+++ Well, why does it?
c06733 +++$+++ Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
c14016 +++$+++ You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
c04531 +++$+++ If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
c12520 +++$+++ Yes. The vampire apocalypse. It is said that all who feel its taint will succumb to the Thirst.
c10054 +++$+++ Mary.
c21630 +++$+++ I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
c08644 +++$+++ It's just a work thing.
c03854 +++$+++ Oh. Well, what is it exactly that you do?
c01770 +++$+++ Come on in. What you been up to?
c12734 +++$+++ Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
c16515 +++$+++ Oh, well, what, what's he...
c13836 +++$+++ Funny situation, ain't it, Andy?
c16729 +++$+++ But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
c05083 +++$+++ Why not?
c01978 +++$+++ Why do they have to die for me?
c27264 +++$+++ Dorothy next!
c16569 +++$+++ I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch?
c19748 +++$+++ You went in the apartment?
c13945 +++$+++ He never even kids about it.
c16518 +++$+++ Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
c25801 +++$+++ Everything O.K.?
c00655 +++$+++ The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
c07958 +++$+++ Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
c19221 +++$+++ Tom?
c21245 +++$+++ Let's go to Detroit.
c06629 +++$+++ Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
c15996 +++$+++ I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
c23474 +++$+++ It was just a thought.
c06521 +++$+++ Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
c08287 +++$+++ It won't. Are you ready?
c00485 +++$+++ Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
c07656 +++$+++ You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
c23986 +++$+++ Yes.
c01656 +++$+++ You want to go talk to him?
c15382 +++$+++ How long's he been here?
c18812 +++$+++ What are they?
c07278 +++$+++ If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
c14212 +++$+++ Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
c09279 +++$+++ No it doesn't.
c11951 +++$+++ Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
c07170 +++$+++ Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
c17257 +++$+++ I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
c03310 +++$+++ Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
c05197 +++$+++ She answered our prayers.
c05879 +++$+++ You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
c05950 +++$+++ Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
c04957 +++$+++ What's that fucker ever done for us?
c26110 +++$+++ You're alive!
c05050 +++$+++ Sam, Tony, come in here.
c07603 +++$+++ No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
c15151 +++$+++ Who's this?
c12296 +++$+++ Yes.
c06593 +++$+++ You are , aren't you?
c05547 +++$+++ The foulest.  Mayhap I can cut them free.
c26409 +++$+++ Four.
c17924 +++$+++ I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
c24148 +++$+++ Yeah. But not any more.
c07872 +++$+++ Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
c23722 +++$+++ Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
c15021 +++$+++ Yeah.
c03763 +++$+++ She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
c15746 +++$+++ What's my problem? You want a list?
c22169 +++$+++ Stuff it, man!
c15731 +++$+++ I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
c00887 +++$+++ I can't...I can't find a shelter
c14524 +++$+++ When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
c16935 +++$+++ We get to Mexico, we can have a life.
c14120 +++$+++ Veronica, I love you...
c01863 +++$+++ I... I blacked out.
c23905 +++$+++ Have you been checked out?
c26040 +++$+++ No.
c09850 +++$+++ Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
c08160 +++$+++ Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
c03963 +++$+++ I saw everything.
c05764 +++$+++ Six. I go red next year.
c06183 +++$+++ It's better to be free, right?
c16867 +++$+++ It's split the Government.
c16890 +++$+++ They'll recognize me.
c10480 +++$+++ You mean that was a...
c07428 +++$+++ Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
c23377 +++$+++ Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
c03562 +++$+++ Skiing?
c26624 +++$+++ Can't you see?
c24965 +++$+++ What?
c14900 +++$+++ We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
c01220 +++$+++ He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
c16267 +++$+++ Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
c02398 +++$+++ Yes.
c01797 +++$+++ No. You lost your way.
c05008 +++$+++ Let me out of here!
c14563 +++$+++ Fuck you, grease-ball!
c19301 +++$+++ No. Is he sick?
c09061 +++$+++ In a sense, that's all he knew. The system is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take advantage of his memory loss.
c20140 +++$+++ The Sistine Chapel?
c26087 +++$+++ I am here, Captain.
c19451 +++$+++ Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
c06618 +++$+++ But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get--
c00928 +++$+++ But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
c05309 +++$+++ 1985.  Hans Korshaud.
c07012 +++$+++ Shhh! Shhh!
c23949 +++$+++ The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
c07230 +++$+++ David, please --
c25140 +++$+++ A week or so. There's something I want to do here first.
c25487 +++$+++ No.
c21904 +++$+++ Does that mean we can't...
c25601 +++$+++ It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
c04690 +++$+++ Marylin? When did I say...?
c18751 +++$+++ -- especially one like this.
c03178 +++$+++ Let the buyer beware.
c04413 +++$+++ Who?
c10827 +++$+++ Do you consider that a compliment?
c23563 +++$+++ Do you suppose she went out shopping?
c17706 +++$+++ But you don't have any symptoms!
c18510 +++$+++ Anything I can do back here?
c18913 +++$+++ Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
c16227 +++$+++ I know that. But what's the maximum?
c07414 +++$+++ And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
c16119 +++$+++ Whoever you are, don't call again.
c07995 +++$+++ Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
c19249 +++$+++ And you and Private Graves--
c00601 +++$+++ Would you tell me why?
c03410 +++$+++ General, all I know is you have been condemned to the Colosseum, and a trial is nowhere to be seen.
c04094 +++$+++ What do you want from me?
c23658 +++$+++ Good night, Mama...
c03043 +++$+++ Who the hell knows?  Everyone's giving orders.  It's all very democratic.
c17449 +++$+++ We can pick anything.
c00280 +++$+++ Machine.
c07061 +++$+++ That was civil war.
c27339 +++$+++ My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
c08218 +++$+++ That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
c08429 +++$+++ That's five clicks, Jackson.
c20484 +++$+++ Hey ! I'm still your best chance to get out of here alive.
c07079 +++$+++ What about happiness, Mother?
c04236 +++$+++ Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
c16478 +++$+++ Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
c18599 +++$+++ Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
c22554 +++$+++ Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J?  I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah.  What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
c05343 +++$+++ She could be dead now.
c05678 +++$+++ Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
c07474 +++$+++ Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
c26923 +++$+++ Thank you
c25106 +++$+++ I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
c12026 +++$+++ Yeah - I'd do that... You could teach me.
c27449 +++$+++ There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
c16845 +++$+++ Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
c26635 +++$+++ Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
c06616 +++$+++ I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
c07108 +++$+++ ... Use his women.
c19603 +++$+++ We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
c01129 +++$+++ Don't you have any leads at all?
c00070 +++$+++ Chief knows.
c10592 +++$+++ Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
c02829 +++$+++ And if I consent?
c14978 +++$+++ You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
c01482 +++$+++ What the fuck for?
c20733 +++$+++ Oh yes, I'm John Triplette.
c22922 +++$+++ It's always been like this.
c23979 +++$+++ Uh huh.
c03298 +++$+++ Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
c02501 +++$+++ Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
c07808 +++$+++ He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
c04922 +++$+++ How old's Annette?
c18404 +++$+++ Your lips, they didn't move.
c22329 +++$+++ That's right.
c10945 +++$+++ I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
c16940 +++$+++ That certainly makes you kind of special...
c00610 +++$+++ Animals?
c24533 +++$+++ It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
c11085 +++$+++ Hollywood.
c26305 +++$+++ Wait.  What about . . . him?
c09502 +++$+++ Who is it?
c14103 +++$+++ Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
c08623 +++$+++ Down boy.
c18462 +++$+++ Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
c06963 +++$+++ I have nothing to hide.
c14581 +++$+++ You don't seem to understand.
c14449 +++$+++ What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
c26859 +++$+++ But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
c07591 +++$+++ Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
c22207 +++$+++ That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
c11284 +++$+++ If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
c19490 +++$+++ Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
c12586 +++$+++ You wouldn't be putting me out.
c09059 +++$+++ It would take ten years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won't survive that long. Besides, they don't want to live in the middle of The Briar Patch... who would?
c04720 +++$+++ Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
c06658 +++$+++ South Dakota - but on the top.
c24744 +++$+++ Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
c16131 +++$+++ When did you start smoking?
c17431 +++$+++ Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
c17757 +++$+++ You want me to be?
c09037 +++$+++ I will. Can my assistant come, too?
c00226 +++$+++ Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
c22432 +++$+++ Stool pigeon.
c19325 +++$+++ This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
c13648 +++$+++ Need to lose myself awhile.
c00809 +++$+++ Ahh, you'll miss me.
c00248 +++$+++ ...Ma???
c10925 +++$+++ Spoil sport!
c08083 +++$+++ Who?
c20593 +++$+++ I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
c00741 +++$+++ Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
c10854 +++$+++ That wasn't me.
c11833 +++$+++ Yeah.
c24737 +++$+++ Can you handle it?
c23505 +++$+++ That he'd keep an eye on Miyamoto. Watch out for him.
c09308 +++$+++ An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
c09407 +++$+++ We didn't do so bad after all.
c07443 +++$+++ You learned her lessons better than I.
c26101 +++$+++ They'll start to soon enough.
c21929 +++$+++ Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
c06928 +++$+++ You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
c01491 +++$+++ But then how can you...
c12248 +++$+++ He's your cousin.
c11221 +++$+++ You've got something going?
c11302 +++$+++ It's terrific.
c04257 +++$+++ Great story Goober, how much?
c03519 +++$+++ Benjamin -- where are you?
c01306 +++$+++ Well, she... uh...
c03515 +++$+++ I will.
c08132 +++$+++ Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
c05031 +++$+++ I don't know what to say.
c23879 +++$+++ Well, press something!
c14164 +++$+++ Appreciate it.
c10791 +++$+++ She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
c17583 +++$+++ Good.
c12146 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c06758 +++$+++ Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
c05461 +++$+++ I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
c12898 +++$+++ But that's your old hood, Pops.
c15059 +++$+++ You could always take it off.
c23654 +++$+++ I don't look like no possum!
c17737 +++$+++ I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
c22321 +++$+++ Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
c18193 +++$+++ I don't understand.
c17661 +++$+++ Uh...
c06168 +++$+++ [Don't lie to me!]
c00015 +++$+++ Otherwise known as an orgy?
c14816 +++$+++ You're some catch Lloyd.
c20127 +++$+++ Talk to me.
c20931 +++$+++ About not finding any bogey men?
c26914 +++$+++ I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?
c11195 +++$+++ Neither will I.
c09949 +++$+++ It's December 25th, 1993 today.
c20015 +++$+++ Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
c11049 +++$+++ Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
c14890 +++$+++ All set.
c18051 +++$+++ I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
c17238 +++$+++ You got no choice. It's over.
c09675 +++$+++ Lovebirds, I see.
c02679 +++$+++ You keep them.
c16111 +++$+++ You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
c12536 +++$+++ But you use blood banks --
c21425 +++$+++ Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
c09465 +++$+++ All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
c12033 +++$+++ Not black.
c04584 +++$+++ You're doing...Okay.
c19540 +++$+++ It's a helluva disease.
c20212 +++$+++ Left jacket pocket confirmed.
c20770 +++$+++ Is that her real name?
c21961 +++$+++ Don't remember what day that was, do you?
c05285 +++$+++ He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
c07736 +++$+++ It takes time to process --
c13943 +++$+++ Of course.
c27338 +++$+++ If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
c21185 +++$+++ Get out of my way.
c24442 +++$+++ I know.
c17750 +++$+++ Do you?  I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
c02037 +++$+++ Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
c06961 +++$+++ Aren't you late?
c04907 +++$+++ She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
c07442 +++$+++ No...
c25675 +++$+++ One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
c00187 +++$+++ No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
c18564 +++$+++ Sean's asleep.
c09593 +++$+++ I'm here to see Iris.
c14840 +++$+++ I see.  The verdict, yes...
c03347 +++$+++ ... I thought it was the drug store.
c01135 +++$+++ I forgive you.
c14014 +++$+++ But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
c19271 +++$+++ They were using M-1's, yeah--
c15997 +++$+++ Oh.
c16038 +++$+++ You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
c27109 +++$+++ You promise you'll finish school?
c01132 +++$+++ Yeah.
c26344 +++$+++ Hell no!
c16826 +++$+++ I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
c11666 +++$+++ Okay.
c09536 +++$+++ What rumour?
c03071 +++$+++ You guess? You mean you don't know?
c17241 +++$+++ What are you still doing here, Randall?
c07225 +++$+++ Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
c10664 +++$+++ Really? That's remarkable.
c17573 +++$+++ I'm Crash Override.
c03847 +++$+++ I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
c08224 +++$+++ No.
c00992 +++$+++ No women. Not in Boodles. Not since 1922.
c26157 +++$+++ Worse than Cairo?							*
c04825 +++$+++ Why--no--
c00896 +++$+++ Isn't that -- extreme?
c02740 +++$+++ You know what I mean.
c02105 +++$+++ How's that football story corning along?
c06171 +++$+++ What do you mean, I'm here?
c12850 +++$+++ Then why do you?
c26532 +++$+++ So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
c01901 +++$+++ Suppose we do.
c07730 +++$+++ The police are on their way.
c22777 +++$+++ Don't. Think Bailey.
c12443 +++$+++ I was bowling--
c01286 +++$+++ No.
c15636 +++$+++ Dad!
c02412 +++$+++ Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
c23313 +++$+++ As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
c17684 +++$+++ I didn't sleep all night.
c24431 +++$+++ I can't help it if men notice me.
c24190 +++$+++ That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
c15405 +++$+++ What?
c04467 +++$+++ I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
c23769 +++$+++ Uh...over easy.
c08776 +++$+++ You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  A fuckin' joke?
c01108 +++$+++ Are you going public with this?
c17815 +++$+++ <u>Do</u> you.  What does that mean?
c20370 +++$+++ Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
c19968 +++$+++ You like him, don't you?
c12176 +++$+++ Yum, yum.
c27364 +++$+++ By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
c24831 +++$+++ I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
c23590 +++$+++ And you will come to hear us tonight?
c08170 +++$+++ Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
c23002 +++$+++ Who are you?
c13155 +++$+++ This isn't friendship.
c00842 +++$+++ What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
c18601 +++$+++ Don't think about it.  It's over.
c18551 +++$+++ Did you get any pictures?
c25109 +++$+++ Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
c11382 +++$+++ You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
c07897 +++$+++ What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
c03897 +++$+++ Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
c25076 +++$+++ Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
c04949 +++$+++ But you didn't do that.
c19613 +++$+++ No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
c04916 +++$+++ He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
c24680 +++$+++ You will.
c06611 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c21096 +++$+++ This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
c04604 +++$+++ Yes.
c23484 +++$+++ The what.  I've kind of run away from home, you see.  It has nothing to do with my parents or money. I saw something I wasn't supposed to see, and for the time being it's best that I keep myself out of sight.
c08967 +++$+++ No!
c08272 +++$+++ No. Why?
c01173 +++$+++ Pull up a chair.  Oh, excuse me, this is my lady DOT.
c13546 +++$+++ Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
c21782 +++$+++ Then you would use your--
c17676 +++$+++ Uh, yes!
c06116 +++$+++ Just an idle question.
c10005 +++$+++ I... I don't know.  I don't know what you're askin' me.
c14870 +++$+++ Alan...
c24259 +++$+++ I'd love to read that.
c03767 +++$+++ Ja?
c00172 +++$+++ Really?
c26193 +++$+++ Tomorrow.
c14602 +++$+++ Yes.  The very killer of Li Mu Bai's own master.  Last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
c22239 +++$+++ I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
c22479 +++$+++ Six-fifty.
c18996 +++$+++ I consider it less my failure than his.
c12237 +++$+++ Help vouchers?
c25235 +++$+++ Look, Charlie, you didn't do it, and you know you didn't.
c02795 +++$+++ No.
c18575 +++$+++ The tide's running.  It'll take us to the light.
c00353 +++$+++ Peace - the dignity of man - the destiny of the human spirit!  Show me a man who says you win <u>those</u> by fighting wars, and <u>I'll</u> show you an idiot!
c05567 +++$+++ A promise is a sacred oath.
c16218 +++$+++ Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
c08108 +++$+++ Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
c21518 +++$+++ Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
c14159 +++$+++ Never could save a thing.
c25990 +++$+++ No more pissant basin league bullshit for us, hunh?
c21083 +++$+++ You ol' fucker!
c13308 +++$+++ Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
c06378 +++$+++ That's a chance I gotta take.
c07330 +++$+++ I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
c08844 +++$+++ They never caught on.
c21803 +++$+++ -- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
c03809 +++$+++ Nah.
c13268 +++$+++ Like what?
c25947 +++$+++ Sure is a hairy fellah.
c19662 +++$+++ A personal nature?
c11354 +++$+++ Who said that?
c17909 +++$+++ Our little toy. You usually have it up and running by now.
c16421 +++$+++ Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
c02032 +++$+++ No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
c11950 +++$+++ Well ain't that a kick in the head!
c22317 +++$+++ No we didn't.  He died on his own.
c09962 +++$+++ Well, what time is it?
c02632 +++$+++ I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
c10824 +++$+++ I don't love you.
c24416 +++$+++ We're from different worlds.
c04716 +++$+++ Soon, you'll have your own rage!
c22550 +++$+++ I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
c13725 +++$+++ Maybe.
c05922 +++$+++ You coulda told me what you were doing.
c22428 +++$+++ Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
c04581 +++$+++ What way?
c23055 +++$+++ No.
c22128 +++$+++ But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
c24935 +++$+++ There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
c23133 +++$+++ That headboard.
c22312 +++$+++ Well someone's gonna find them.
c12624 +++$+++ The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
c22093 +++$+++ I don't think so.
c04336 +++$+++ Ooka.
c21978 +++$+++ Where is she?
c04917 +++$+++ It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
c16812 +++$+++ I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
c19814 +++$+++ What?
c05546 +++$+++ Beware.
c19680 +++$+++ Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
c20946 +++$+++ That was different.
c15204 +++$+++ No, you the man.
c14118 +++$+++ Sure.
c24078 +++$+++ No.
c18237 +++$+++ No sweat, Alex, you only made the biggest mistake of <u>my</u> life.  What was your per-diem?
c01748 +++$+++ Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
c18205 +++$+++ Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
c10561 +++$+++ Ready for another?
c04913 +++$+++ But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
c03898 +++$+++ Yes.
c27402 +++$+++ MMMMM!  MMMMM!
c20120 +++$+++ What?
c20500 +++$+++ If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
c00930 +++$+++ Oh.
c05943 +++$+++ About who?
c22145 +++$+++ I'll carry him 'till the third.
c27347 +++$+++ Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
c03375 +++$+++ What do you mean "bad?"
c24130 +++$+++ What's an audience going to tell you?
c07764 +++$+++ Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
c20693 +++$+++ It's on National television, Barnett.
c03100 +++$+++ Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
c04330 +++$+++ That's great.
c10023 +++$+++ No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any deals.
c17332 +++$+++ Will you take a check?
c21874 +++$+++ Heil you know who!
c09718 +++$+++ I'm not sure, but...
c21957 +++$+++ Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
c10466 +++$+++ Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
c01223 +++$+++ Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
c20584 +++$+++ He's so tiny.
c05107 +++$+++ Scientists. Very intellegent men.
c23199 +++$+++ But what?
c00294 +++$+++ That's right.
c05944 +++$+++ You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
c20435 +++$+++ It can turn itself on, Alex!  It doesn't need a quarter.
c03859 +++$+++ Eh, no.
c17649 +++$+++ It's the bogyman, isn't it?
c26435 +++$+++ For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
c16588 +++$+++ They bust you every week.
c24338 +++$+++ Roll 'em.
c26654 +++$+++ What's tomorrow?
c25602 +++$+++ How!?
c05505 +++$+++ Neat.
c11099 +++$+++ ... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
c17717 +++$+++ Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
c15808 +++$+++ Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
c18289 +++$+++ Ya get the special?
c17753 +++$+++ Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
c14782 +++$+++ They say sex is great for cramps.
c15840 +++$+++ Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
c17630 +++$+++ Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
c01017 +++$+++ Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
c13357 +++$+++ A powerful man.
c23739 +++$+++ Sooner than later.
c09252 +++$+++ You don't know what you're fucking with here.
c18066 +++$+++ I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
c13372 +++$+++ Okay.
c15708 +++$+++ I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
c01604 +++$+++ You're all through with this now?
c14208 +++$+++ Like what?
c06917 +++$+++ I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
c04582 +++$+++ Why?
c22071 +++$+++ The booze.
c24830 +++$+++ Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
c03228 +++$+++ I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
c11217 +++$+++ Okay, I get it.
c21806 +++$+++ I don't think more than ten.
c13992 +++$+++ That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
c19278 +++$+++ Deal drugs in the bathroom--
c02621 +++$+++ Ben did this?
c04533 +++$+++ Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
c10263 +++$+++ Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
c11046 +++$+++ We have that in common.
c26201 +++$+++ We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
c00424 +++$+++ Bang!
c18695 +++$+++ Someone bet me a dollar ..
c10269 +++$+++ Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
c17226 +++$+++ One likes to live simply.
c21670 +++$+++ Delivering gossip and goodwill. It seems we'll both be doing Brighton.  Perhaps you should come too.
c21596 +++$+++ Because you think your in love with me?
c21646 +++$+++ History books are first onto the bonfires.
c08419 +++$+++ You have to tell me --
c00768 +++$+++ No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
c04250 +++$+++ Yikes.
c22019 +++$+++ Is she all right?
c20990 +++$+++ Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
c07009 +++$+++ You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
c04249 +++$+++ You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
c25647 +++$+++ Listen to me....You have no need to distrust me.  We're going....
c09433 +++$+++ This morning.
c19993 +++$+++ I just want you to tell me how you came by that car.
c06925 +++$+++ Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
c18936 +++$+++ Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
c26440 +++$+++ Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
c18720 +++$+++ Lotta scratch-marks on your door?
c08978 +++$+++ Have they proceeded with their experiments?
c13554 +++$+++ Do you know what's in that box?
c06439 +++$+++ Same here.
c08952 +++$+++ Say thank you.
c21556 +++$+++ Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
c21133 +++$+++ And then what, Faith?
c20615 +++$+++ He's okay isn't he?
c07192 +++$+++ I been immobile.
c01365 +++$+++ You don't understand me.
c26826 +++$+++ How's your wife?
c16851 +++$+++ If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
c07644 +++$+++ You're not allowed to lie.
c24115 +++$+++ No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
c01301 +++$+++ This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
c18507 +++$+++ Oh, now, don't rub it in.
c06025 +++$+++ Where is this happening?
c19314 +++$+++ You've got your mother, your kids--
c25957 +++$+++ No, it's not what you think, I swear!
c27407 +++$+++ Love me?
c10963 +++$+++ Oh, a little savage, is he?
c18079 +++$+++ We can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  Then we can run for it.
c08211 +++$+++ You want me to keep that under the table for you?
c17164 +++$+++ I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
c16788 +++$+++ I guess not.
c21853 +++$+++ I already have.  Come on.
c14097 +++$+++ Get the fuck outta here already.
c13457 +++$+++ Fine.
c22007 +++$+++ How could that be, son?
c03642 +++$+++ What?  What for?
c04244 +++$+++ What are you going to be then?
c25351 +++$+++ To avoid killing anyone.
c07763 +++$+++ You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
c12289 +++$+++ But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
c14341 +++$+++ You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
c08689 +++$+++ No.
c23820 +++$+++ ... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
c26351 +++$+++ A lot that means.
c11276 +++$+++ Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
c03266 +++$+++ Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
c11656 +++$+++ This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
c24509 +++$+++ What more?
c22972 +++$+++ Why didn't he make his move back there?
c17665 +++$+++ Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
c27256 +++$+++ Supposin' you met an elephant?
c05761 +++$+++ When do you go up?
c11451 +++$+++ Nobody told me digging was so much fun!  You pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
c00426 +++$+++ Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
c02054 +++$+++ And you have this letter of intent?
c17804 +++$+++ Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
c13232 +++$+++ Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
c04189 +++$+++ It'll be Heaven!
c05389 +++$+++ Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
c05056 +++$+++ I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
c05623 +++$+++ I'll hate you forever.
c01106 +++$+++ "During heat episodes of 2000 Kelvin or higher, Trych breaks down and dissipates. Will consume magnesium".
c05273 +++$+++ Yeah.
c22462 +++$+++ "Nothing but net."
c21444 +++$+++ You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
c04152 +++$+++ But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
c06978 +++$+++ You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
c07047 +++$+++ I understand that, sir.
c14550 +++$+++ I just thought that--
c20716 +++$+++ Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
c25234 +++$+++ Sure.
c26359 +++$+++ You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
c06482 +++$+++ You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
c02000 +++$+++ You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
c26708 +++$+++ And what happens when you can't?
c14997 +++$+++ Okay.
c20997 +++$+++ Yup.
c16171 +++$+++ Need a nurse?
c23006 +++$+++ Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
c07348 +++$+++ Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
c17847 +++$+++ We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
c23866 +++$+++ You sound defensive.
c16598 +++$+++ Shoot.
c23381 +++$+++ No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
c05333 +++$+++ Answer the question.
c14499 +++$+++ Are you OK?
c11301 +++$+++ Yeah.
c10165 +++$+++ I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject -- Indian -- entering suspect's house. Over.
c08633 +++$+++ Second verse!
c03522 +++$+++ No.
c24270 +++$+++ Your sure as hell right about that.
c24844 +++$+++ Been to the Boat Show.
c07395 +++$+++ Who fucking cares? You cops killed Cy. And before you bastards kill anyone else, I'll give you your fucking set up. That make you happy??!!
c22530 +++$+++ He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
c12929 +++$+++ Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
c05217 +++$+++ Up yours.
c15536 +++$+++ So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
c12380 +++$+++ Do tell. I love a good plan.
c06393 +++$+++ There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
c19974 +++$+++ What?!
c18408 +++$+++ That's what the one who made me said.
c18781 +++$+++ You said "fuck".
c15611 +++$+++ You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
c16089 +++$+++ How do you know?
c13028 +++$+++ Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
c12836 +++$+++ No.
c12267 +++$+++ No, Eve. I'm not related to Basil and Perdita.
c20658 +++$+++ Someday she'll thank you.
c11835 +++$+++ Now it's okay?
c01612 +++$+++ It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
c12997 +++$+++ Did you?
c04239 +++$+++ You do, you do. You're just not saying.
c11945 +++$+++ Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
c06169 +++$+++ [Who gave the bags to Ramos?]
c06368 +++$+++ Get good at it.
c02749 +++$+++ Fired?
c02159 +++$+++ Why don't you have more time?
c27141 +++$+++ Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
c12508 +++$+++ It would've been easy for you to let me die back there today, but you didn't.
c14143 +++$+++ Sure you can.
c17580 +++$+++ It's a little boxy thing, Norm, with switches on it... lets my computer talk to the one there...
c26005 +++$+++ Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?
c11695 +++$+++ Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
c05650 +++$+++ No.  I was going to let you do that.
c03634 +++$+++ Oh, don't be stupid.
c05841 +++$+++ I was?
c23031 +++$+++ No, the morning rooster woke me.
c23103 +++$+++ Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
c01086 +++$+++ Brian, look --
c20935 +++$+++ I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
c12958 +++$+++ He said you lost something.
c02035 +++$+++ No, I'm not. I need a job.
c23802 +++$+++ The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
c25894 +++$+++ Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
c02897 +++$+++ Gotcha!
c00851 +++$+++ After six.
c09404 +++$+++ Let's go.
c13194 +++$+++ If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
c18518 +++$+++ Where are you going?
c17739 +++$+++ This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
c17411 +++$+++ Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
c20224 +++$+++ We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
c23582 +++$+++ Brains aren't everything.
c25859 +++$+++ That a fact?
c01930 +++$+++ My office.
c11518 +++$+++ Oh.
c05914 +++$+++ You don't know me at all.
c09848 +++$+++ What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
c09248 +++$+++ Jesus.
c15881 +++$+++ But tell me why ...
c16415 +++$+++ Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
c05978 +++$+++ So you won't help me?
c17353 +++$+++ Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
c05186 +++$+++ Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
c14719 +++$+++ Where did you mail them?
c27032 +++$+++ Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU.
c04177 +++$+++ We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
c08994 +++$+++ Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
c23822 +++$+++ We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
c09713 +++$+++ You must be exhausted.
c23938 +++$+++ What's that, Diz ?
c26608 +++$+++ Ernie's.
c10901 +++$+++ Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
c21845 +++$+++ But that's cheating!
c25121 +++$+++ You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
c21524 +++$+++ The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
c18198 +++$+++ Why?
c24805 +++$+++ Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
c15260 +++$+++ If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
c15460 +++$+++ Me?! That's you!
c05345 +++$+++ Let's change the subject.
c06294 +++$+++ You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
c06140 +++$+++ Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
c25678 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c12179 +++$+++ Not what?
c05223 +++$+++ Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
c18592 +++$+++ Yeah.
c15499 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c25142 +++$+++ So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
c22778 +++$+++ I heard a noise.
c24105 +++$+++ Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b...
c14542 +++$+++ Because you're the closest.
c04726 +++$+++ So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
c18359 +++$+++ Yes, it was -- I ended up --
c23924 +++$+++ I don't know, Zander.
c08316 +++$+++ I don't want to discuss it.
c17885 +++$+++ stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
c15686 +++$+++ May God make safety your companion.
c10520 +++$+++ Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
c19636 +++$+++ If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
c00814 +++$+++ Jesse, you explain to Lyla. My girl, you know, from that time...
c27405 +++$+++ Oh, darling -- I'll count the hours that you're away.
c25813 +++$+++ I wish I could.
c15109 +++$+++ Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
c10285 +++$+++ Well...all <u>right</u>!  We just roll on out of here!
c09664 +++$+++ Why are they trying to kill people?
c10726 +++$+++ Ah, come on.
c21585 +++$+++ Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
c20558 +++$+++ Boyfriend?
c08624 +++$+++ You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
c21691 +++$+++ Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
c08330 +++$+++ I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
c03667 +++$+++ Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
c23146 +++$+++ Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
c22376 +++$+++ So what's your story?
c11171 +++$+++ Haldeman too?
c22175 +++$+++ You think everybody I fight is a bum.
c27023 +++$+++ My jury's still out on that,
c08701 +++$+++ Without peer?
c01585 +++$+++ And the ocean!  A mountain range!
c07868 +++$+++ Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
c11938 +++$+++ And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
c27307 +++$+++ Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
c02025 +++$+++ If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
c22802 +++$+++ Yeah?
c03288 +++$+++ Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
c10505 +++$+++ That was Nancy, not me!
c10244 +++$+++ Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
c21422 +++$+++ Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
c20467 +++$+++ "Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
c24344 +++$+++ Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
c06843 +++$+++ Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  We bought this house and I spent the rest on this.  It's the bomb, huh?
c25532 +++$+++ Oh, he's sitting up.
c17713 +++$+++ You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
c20980 +++$+++ Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
c26058 +++$+++ You'll have to send us a postcard.
c06316 +++$+++ We'll get a handwriting expert to--  What!
c12861 +++$+++ Is the dizziness gone?
c17848 +++$+++ What are you doing here?!
c02560 +++$+++ I don't know the process, Dr. Weir was the expert...
c03467 +++$+++ What?
c20287 +++$+++ I'm freezing to death.
c17871 +++$+++ Any contestants worth mentioning?
c00350 +++$+++ I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
c04864 +++$+++ Please answer the question.
c03965 +++$+++ I thought half of it was your brother's?
c04508 +++$+++ Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
c05092 +++$+++ JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
c23811 +++$+++ Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
c13187 +++$+++ One year...almost one year.
c26868 +++$+++ ...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
c19994 +++$+++ You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
c16313 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c22147 +++$+++ You're hurtin', man!
c14055 +++$+++ I can pass!
c19154 +++$+++ In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
c16199 +++$+++ This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
c05058 +++$+++ I love you when you're angry.
c13991 +++$+++ But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
c15417 +++$+++ Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
c00893 +++$+++ You are a fanatic.
c14192 +++$+++ Through there for a bath.
c21468 +++$+++ Now that you mention it...
c09829 +++$+++ I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
c26400 +++$+++ A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
c24585 +++$+++ And what's that?
c09301 +++$+++ A grill pattern.
c19689 +++$+++ I knew I could count on you.
c11367 +++$+++ Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
c24591 +++$+++ I could wrap it up.  Protect the other kids.
c18196 +++$+++ Where is she now?
c21604 +++$+++ I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
c02363 +++$+++ Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
c22570 +++$+++ I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
c14141 +++$+++ What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
c18296 +++$+++ But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
c18085 +++$+++ It's a crank, Louise.  C'mon, don't waste my time with that!
c12796 +++$+++ What happened?
c20438 +++$+++ I'm okay.
c01735 +++$+++ How big is it?
c16409 +++$+++ Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
c21744 +++$+++ I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
c16455 +++$+++ I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
c14060 +++$+++ Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
c01122 +++$+++ In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
c25505 +++$+++ tried him once -
c05727 +++$+++ Is this a joke?
c26815 +++$+++ <u>Who</u>?
c02615 +++$+++ That's good. That's uh... good.
c13822 +++$+++ ...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
c09013 +++$+++ Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
c27322 +++$+++ What new information?
c01143 +++$+++ Yes, Sister?
c22072 +++$+++ Dean Martin.
c24353 +++$+++ It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
c08761 +++$+++ Occasionally.
c16170 +++$+++ What're you talkin' about?
c09703 +++$+++ No, I have my things in the car.
c12996 +++$+++ Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
c10885 +++$+++ I don't know.
c06026 +++$+++ Ruiz tied in out there?
c21202 +++$+++ You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
c21508 +++$+++ For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
c16690 +++$+++ Toy wit' this will ya.
c17986 +++$+++ Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
c03714 +++$+++ Hello.
c11772 +++$+++ Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
c06778 +++$+++ Why not?
c08179 +++$+++ Oh.
c17965 +++$+++ Wife, girlfriend or mother?
c21079 +++$+++ At this hour?
c13374 +++$+++ It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care.
c27039 +++$+++ You can't just -
c06500 +++$+++ What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
c07350 +++$+++ I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
c00473 +++$+++ I guess this is a first for you.
c18524 +++$+++ They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
c18241 +++$+++ I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
c06195 +++$+++ You're lying. I don't believe you.
c15565 +++$+++ Under the house.
c02996 +++$+++ You think you could do better "Laredo?"
c12633 +++$+++ I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
c04524 +++$+++ Yeah?
c14356 +++$+++ How do you mean?
c03685 +++$+++ Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
c07815 +++$+++ Yes?
c23862 +++$+++ I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
c00084 +++$+++ Yes.  Yes, come with me!
c25410 +++$+++ Who told you?
c13484 +++$+++ Get up.
c08495 +++$+++ The other guy drew first.
c23984 +++$+++ You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
c12801 +++$+++ That bastard!
c26592 +++$+++ What?
c09035 +++$+++ I am well, Admiral.
c24138 +++$+++ Maybe he's that one in a million!
c20945 +++$+++ We're not always as good at things as we'd like.
c22772 +++$+++ What other point is -
c21489 +++$+++ Thought you didn't believe his story.
c05133 +++$+++ You've mentioned it about fifty times.
c07999 +++$+++ No--I was just--maybe--
c14878 +++$+++ You're kidding.
c19259 +++$+++ If it's too late--
c25677 +++$+++ I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
c20551 +++$+++ I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
c19902 +++$+++ 'It's up to Joe'?
c17263 +++$+++ Shadow games ...
c22426 +++$+++ We are both full of shit.
c26426 +++$+++ Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
c08812 +++$+++ "Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
c14815 +++$+++ You can't believe this bullshit.
c08977 +++$+++ Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
c16419 +++$+++ Do you remember what triggered it all?
c11404 +++$+++ I mean, you're really back.
c11512 +++$+++ In this house, you're supposed to.
c11368 +++$+++ They're persecuted enough!
c14663 +++$+++ And then I can go home?
c03493 +++$+++ No.
c22272 +++$+++ Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
c12200 +++$+++ off the peg?
c14523 +++$+++ They don't have a murder weapon?
c15306 +++$+++ No, but many consider my training valuable.
c19930 +++$+++ I believe that, don't you?
c11616 +++$+++ Oh Captain, that is so true.
c22217 +++$+++ I've already seen your photographs.
c17360 +++$+++ I got one of those too.
c16368 +++$+++ Go ahead.  Say it.
c19952 +++$+++ No.
c17054 +++$+++ Murray said...
c17551 +++$+++ I wouldn't let happen.
c17572 +++$+++ You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
c15349 +++$+++ This is my way of telling you --
c25481 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c13586 +++$+++ That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
c03620 +++$+++ Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
c17828 +++$+++ Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
c01120 +++$+++ They're waitin' man.
c11886 +++$+++ What theater was I at?
c14102 +++$+++ How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
c15966 +++$+++ Oh, Christ.
c05106 +++$+++ We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
c15239 +++$+++ That's what I think.
c12877 +++$+++ Yes.
c01006 +++$+++ Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
c10533 +++$+++ Of a fight he can't win out here.
c08896 +++$+++ Where is he now?
c25569 +++$+++ Who fired you?
c10927 +++$+++ You never know, you might be lucky this time.
c24212 +++$+++ Call them every five miles.
c14617 +++$+++ Do you know what you destroyed?
c19071 +++$+++ He never said "go".
c05182 +++$+++ Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
c05724 +++$+++ That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
c05966 +++$+++ Just a nickname.
c19970 +++$+++ Be deliriously happy.  Or at least leave yourself open to be.
c00365 +++$+++ Who?
c23412 +++$+++ I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
c11876 +++$+++ Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
c18351 +++$+++ Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
c26557 +++$+++ The most respected ...
c07390 +++$+++ That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
c26389 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c07354 +++$+++ I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
c23664 +++$+++ But, Miss Boatwright, you--
c11949 +++$+++ No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now -
c19557 +++$+++ Claudia.
c07057 +++$+++ At least Mitchell stood up to it.
c21315 +++$+++ I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
c00708 +++$+++ I don't rightly know, sir.
c01256 +++$+++ You saved Kendall's life --
c03435 +++$+++ Benjamin -- this is my mother!
c15153 +++$+++ You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... Give me one of them, anyway ... Just one ...
c27051 +++$+++ You've killed but you're not a killer
c03933 +++$+++ You're going alone?
c16596 +++$+++ Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
c01835 +++$+++ So I did! And what was so important about it?
c21099 +++$+++ NO.
c23421 +++$+++ No, I mean your past. About why you were in here.  I'll take you first thing in the mornin'. You have anyplace you can stay tonight at all? I just can't let you stay here. It's the rules. If something happened well, I'd be liable.
c00511 +++$+++ We are with the Police Department. This is Sergeant Sykes, and I am--
c14227 +++$+++ Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
c26473 +++$+++ You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
c07711 +++$+++ -- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
c10944 +++$+++ What are they saying?
c01027 +++$+++ Good. Glad to see they're together at last. They don't get along. Promotion. Top job. Most unfair. Quite a fuss at the Ministry.
c27262 +++$+++ To Oz?
c20385 +++$+++ I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
c14001 +++$+++ I've got a brush in the closet.  As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
c16062 +++$+++ Right.
c02422 +++$+++ What?
c09450 +++$+++ I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
c08317 +++$+++ It looks like a tablecloth.
c11981 +++$+++ I had him in two classes.
c15043 +++$+++ It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
c16047 +++$+++ She asked for it.
c23613 +++$+++ If you want a ringside table, tell 'em you're one of the pall bearers.
c05320 +++$+++ Any sign of rape?
c15684 +++$+++ What's the matter with you?
c05360 +++$+++ If you're going to marry a warrior, you'd best get used to it.
c13778 +++$+++ Nothing. I just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. You didn't say goodbye.
c12298 +++$+++ ... Sir?
c22800 +++$+++ Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
c02705 +++$+++ Jesus.
c08739 +++$+++ I love her.
c11104 +++$+++ You're Margo. Just - Margo.
c12032 +++$+++ Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
c06433 +++$+++ Boo-Boo.
c11291 +++$+++ Oh - you're an actress.
c14993 +++$+++ She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
c19920 +++$+++ Patients have visitors, not doctors.
c03572 +++$+++ All right.
c04408 +++$+++ Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
c05297 +++$+++ You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
c04960 +++$+++ I understand woman, damn!
c09876 +++$+++ Send him home.  You don't want him to see it.
c22964 +++$+++ Scar! Where's he holed in?
c08074 +++$+++ YOU TELL HER!
c17993 +++$+++ I think it's time I came home now.
c13073 +++$+++ How long will she he away?
c19379 +++$+++ What about Philip Swann?
c02987 +++$+++ Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
c00849 +++$+++ No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
c02704 +++$+++ I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
c22165 +++$+++ Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
c11247 +++$+++ That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
c17302 +++$+++ Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
c26769 +++$+++ Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar ---- you making it okay in there?
c20024 +++$+++ I'll ride with him. You follow.
c10270 +++$+++ You never loved me, Hauser!  You just used me to get inside.
c12142 +++$+++ I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
c01179 +++$+++ It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
c19818 +++$+++ From what?
c06141 +++$+++ You're my father.
c23022 +++$+++ Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
c15503 +++$+++ I don't care.
c09763 +++$+++ All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
c18604 +++$+++ You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
c13295 +++$+++ Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
c04317 +++$+++ Rose, please go away.
c15419 +++$+++ No. It's a mess.
c13045 +++$+++ Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
c13658 +++$+++ I'm sure.
c01756 +++$+++ Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
c07328 +++$+++ Yes, sir!!
c22249 +++$+++ The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
c03744 +++$+++ Oh dear.
c26096 +++$+++ I don't get it.
c15988 +++$+++ Give me the keys.
c23245 +++$+++ Come on, Doc.  He only went to bed a few hours ago.  Can't you wait till later?
c09507 +++$+++ Yes it is.
c16312 +++$+++ Nope.
c16192 +++$+++ Not by a long shot.
c11994 +++$+++ No.
c21144 +++$+++ Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
c05946 +++$+++ You set your patients on fire!
c07979 +++$+++ We'll take it!
c17129 +++$+++ If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem.
c04012 +++$+++ It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
c14294 +++$+++ Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
c01712 +++$+++ They obviously weren't designed for racing.
c15630 +++$+++ We'd rather not--
c20350 +++$+++ When's your next round?
c08622 +++$+++ Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
c16916 +++$+++ What do you want for dinner?
c11122 +++$+++ I never said it was!
c13841 +++$+++ ...owe you.
c04745 +++$+++ You're going to finance him, I suppose.
c11052 +++$+++ Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
c25068 +++$+++ Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
c22393 +++$+++ Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
c07637 +++$+++ Yeah ... How'd you know?
c19123 +++$+++ I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
c17335 +++$+++ What is it?
c21944 +++$+++ Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
c09924 +++$+++ He said he traveled for two months.
c14373 +++$+++ It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
c07498 +++$+++ Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
c22486 +++$+++ Yes.
c06640 +++$+++ Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
c24334 +++$+++ I know, but we can't quite figure out how to, y'know, do it.
c20891 +++$+++ You need my help?
c08764 +++$+++ I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
c24107 +++$+++ You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
c24360 +++$+++ Why did she call me?
c05347 +++$+++ Why?
c01498 +++$+++ Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
c15267 +++$+++ Shut up!
c03681 +++$+++ Is Tim there?
c24289 +++$+++ For a while.
c03429 +++$+++ But you're not enrolled.
c27072 +++$+++ Do it?
c04456 +++$+++ Really? You don't mind?
c17331 +++$+++ You want us to give you cash right now?
c17346 +++$+++ I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
c10104 +++$+++ Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
c13591 +++$+++ Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
c16000 +++$+++ I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
c13486 +++$+++ Yeah, but they're complaining.
c05916 +++$+++ Or someone has a nitrogenizer.
c11401 +++$+++ Scout's honor.
c06000 +++$+++ What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
c16624 +++$+++ This morning.
c19428 +++$+++ Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
c13059 +++$+++ "Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
c08909 +++$+++ The Nexus.
c20031 +++$+++ When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
c26716 +++$+++ He's quiet.
c17385 +++$+++ I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
c19090 +++$+++ You calm down!
c26644 +++$+++ Tell me.
c14296 +++$+++ Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
c18892 +++$+++ There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
c26761 +++$+++ Don't say that.
c20304 +++$+++ Alright.
c02717 +++$+++ Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
c20629 +++$+++ I would.
c05873 +++$+++ Oh, thank you. Thank you!
c26744 +++$+++ Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
c16907 +++$+++ You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
c24395 +++$+++ Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
c04399 +++$+++ Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
c22786 +++$+++ Fair enough.
c05099 +++$+++ Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
c26978 +++$+++ Oh, right.  Yes.  Harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  Wouldn't hurt a fly.
c18127 +++$+++ You have no whiskey?
c05054 +++$+++ I want to know. You tell me!
c21521 +++$+++ But how long is a day?
c21069 +++$+++ Ten bucks.
c23079 +++$+++ Unfeasible.
c10830 +++$+++ He never misses a chance to humiliate me, to let me know that he doesn't care about me any more.
c11978 +++$+++ Who?
c04641 +++$+++ Alright. What did you think?
c25211 +++$+++ You'll try again tomorrow?
c22448 +++$+++ You a cop or something?
c02483 +++$+++ No, not at all.
c24897 +++$+++ Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.
c08851 +++$+++ You make my mouth water.
c20260 +++$+++ You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
c05826 +++$+++ I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
c17594 +++$+++ I'll take you down there.
c11686 +++$+++ Because...
c21311 +++$+++ I didn't have time.
c15455 +++$+++ Oh. All right. I'11 watch at home, then.
c25415 +++$+++ You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
c06715 +++$+++ I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
c15932 +++$+++ I didn't know that.
c10219 +++$+++ Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
c19354 +++$+++ I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
c13382 +++$+++ She was afraid to call you.
c18276 +++$+++ I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
c14287 +++$+++ Now's not really the time to get into this --
c09769 +++$+++ Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
c17218 +++$+++ Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
c03520 +++$+++ I don't believe it.
c11232 +++$+++ Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
c26725 +++$+++ Can we just talk this out?
c03657 +++$+++ Think Eddie had something to do with it?
c01538 +++$+++ And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
c22853 +++$+++ Let's get out of here!
c14416 +++$+++ Ruben's gone to look... It's banged up but it looks like a .44.  It's Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?
c18056 +++$+++ We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
c24453 +++$+++ Me??
c16622 +++$+++ Muchas gracias.
c15054 +++$+++ You startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
c07008 +++$+++ I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
c20842 +++$+++ Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
c05640 +++$+++ I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
c16576 +++$+++ Fletch...
c21195 +++$+++ O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
c21780 +++$+++ That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
c06559 +++$+++ I said--shall we get started *now* or--
c08760 +++$+++ Looks a little constipated to me.
c06895 +++$+++ No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
c26463 +++$+++ Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
c25197 +++$+++ Your mother?
c12102 +++$+++ That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
c13954 +++$+++ Of course not.
c24750 +++$+++ A girl.  You know.
c16402 +++$+++ What?
c05990 +++$+++ Precog Deja Vu...
c08727 +++$+++ You fucking bastard...
c08720 +++$+++ They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
c24474 +++$+++ We back in Metropolis?
c15984 +++$+++ Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
c09096 +++$+++ Invasion.
c17859 +++$+++ I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
c05094 +++$+++ Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.
c16740 +++$+++ I hear that.
c00635 +++$+++ But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
c01839 +++$+++ With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
c15012 +++$+++ With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
c04371 +++$+++ Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
c11021 +++$+++ Give me a yell is something happens.
c06416 +++$+++ -- You told me.
c21357 +++$+++ Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
c25951 +++$+++ But why would Andy want me?
c18416 +++$+++ What plans?
c23797 +++$+++ You don't get two chances with Junior.
c06545 +++$+++ Here--where are you running off to?
c00830 +++$+++ Why?
c19644 +++$+++ So what has changed?
c10477 +++$+++ Thank you, sir.  If they start anything, we can blast them right off the earth!
c10688 +++$+++ Don't be. I don't care if they expel me. I probably should be expelled.
c02296 +++$+++ You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
c04658 +++$+++ You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
c23593 +++$+++ Do you mind riding backwards? It may take a little longer -
c09812 +++$+++ Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
c09207 +++$+++ Shit... shit... what shit?
c27011 +++$+++ Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
c08617 +++$+++ Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
c10663 +++$+++ Sounds like a good one.
c16369 +++$+++ I don't want to die without any scars.  How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?  Come on... you're the only person I've ever asked.
c10150 +++$+++ Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
c24293 +++$+++ No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
c20521 +++$+++ My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
c02141 +++$+++ I make it six.
c19305 +++$+++ You got in late last night.
c12205 +++$+++ Ow! I'll kick your butt!
c12614 +++$+++ I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
c04153 +++$+++ Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
c16340 +++$+++ So far, you have four and I only have two!
c19685 +++$+++ Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
c24429 +++$+++ What about my proposal?
c23748 +++$+++ Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
c06561 +++$+++ No.
c10661 +++$+++ Yea?
c05093 +++$+++ Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
c12755 +++$+++ All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
c24529 +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
c03022 +++$+++ Former Commander?
c21575 +++$+++ Couldn't be.
c22708 +++$+++ I love you dad.
c00477 +++$+++ Go ahead.
c17028 +++$+++ You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
c04305 +++$+++ You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
c24222 +++$+++ Why should they call us back?
c06142 +++$+++ You will, baby -- if the time come.
c02848 +++$+++ Listen to what I'm saying. The militia's arriving to quarantine the city. Most of us are getting out while we still can.
c14502 +++$+++ Silly, silly, silly.
c26739 +++$+++ That's a good one.
c03926 +++$+++ No. Don't --
c00525 +++$+++ How could a straight-arrow like you ever pick a roommate like him?
c12541 +++$+++ Let's talk to your husband--
c15930 +++$+++ You strike me with words as hard as steel.
c01020 +++$+++ Makes two of us.
c10254 +++$+++ Let me buy you a drink.
c11098 +++$+++ Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
c10265 +++$+++ What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
c03469 +++$+++ We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
c12271 +++$+++ Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
c16972 +++$+++ What kind of entertaining?
c15849 +++$+++ I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
c23007 +++$+++ It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
c16121 +++$+++ He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
c01975 +++$+++ Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
c06795 +++$+++ But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
c00118 +++$+++ Then do it, asshole.
c21897 +++$+++ What's the matter?
c22396 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c25194 +++$+++ Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
c11057 +++$+++ So she seems.
c24026 +++$+++ ...I...
c16075 +++$+++ Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
c01981 +++$+++ It's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
c11795 +++$+++ You're sure?
c00186 +++$+++ They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
c25630 +++$+++ That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
c21650 +++$+++ I'm not sure I can face it.
c24901 +++$+++ I'll have it in a week.
c20984 +++$+++ But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
c01655 +++$+++ Goodnight.
c10336 +++$+++ Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
c12177 +++$+++ Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
c10233 +++$+++ I don't know...
c24840 +++$+++ I thought he was in prison, in England.
c03244 +++$+++ I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
c08802 +++$+++ Bullshit!  Prove it.
c21402 +++$+++ He's not here. We're getting divorced.
c00272 +++$+++ ... What's going on?
c12569 +++$+++ Why?
c09353 +++$+++ Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
c10101 +++$+++ 'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
c25493 +++$+++ He'll never do it.
c01611 +++$+++ Yes.
c01769 +++$+++ What's his name?
c26891 +++$+++ I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
c00164 +++$+++ Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
c03486 +++$+++ Is it?
c17690 +++$+++ Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
c10009 +++$+++ Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
c09303 +++$+++ Oh yes, I see. You must get asked this a lot.
c16961 +++$+++ Address?
c09737 +++$+++ I am the best man for the job.
c23989 +++$+++ That's right...
c04564 +++$+++ I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
c18214 +++$+++ It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
c12379 +++$+++ No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary dream.
c16792 +++$+++ And I'll never do it again. Forgive me?
c16036 +++$+++ You're making things up, Frank.
c21237 +++$+++ That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
c02986 +++$+++ Oh, my bags. I've checked them in.
c14760 +++$+++ Holy shit, I'm a freak.
c12444 +++$+++ This Saturday.  Quintana and--
c18392 +++$+++ You don't have to be involved, Will.
c06721 +++$+++ I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
c00257 +++$+++ I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
c12131 +++$+++ Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
c02682 +++$+++ John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
c04442 +++$+++ What're you talking about?
c02906 +++$+++ Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.
c14571 +++$+++ Sounds boring.
c00212 +++$+++ No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
c20463 +++$+++ Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
c12642 +++$+++ On a ride.
c24009 +++$+++ ...wouldn't that be dangerous?
c02142 +++$+++ Ever?
c11742 +++$+++ He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
c20101 +++$+++ Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
c12591 +++$+++ Christ, I'm getting bored.
c04650 +++$+++ I have to put my family's welfare on the line here, my friend! And what are you puttin' up? You're puttin' up words!
c22375 +++$+++ I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
c22378 +++$+++ I know you, Detective Carter, right? You're Lee's American friend.  Enjoying your visit?
c00345 +++$+++ That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
c14904 +++$+++ You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
c13066 +++$+++ Try next of kin.
c20911 +++$+++ I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
c15218 +++$+++ I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
c18844 +++$+++ You want to talk about this?
c06746 +++$+++ Proceed!
c23395 +++$+++ No sir.
c06120 +++$+++ There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
c22615 +++$+++ How far out of town?
c09521 +++$+++ He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
c04477 +++$+++ No, Dad. You listen to me --
c21907 +++$+++ You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
c16919 +++$+++ It's just been a while.
c12434 +++$+++ Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
c26702 +++$+++ I just want to get married.
c08752 +++$+++ You said he was dead.
c10872 +++$+++ Hm hmm.
c16861 +++$+++ What do you expect when you talk like that?
c10069 +++$+++ A fucking moron.
c05375 +++$+++ I road them often in my youth.
c20086 +++$+++ I read it.
c22916 +++$+++ No way.
c06505 +++$+++ Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
c10955 +++$+++ I knew I could rely on you.
c02212 +++$+++ Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
c14427 +++$+++ Who came in after you?
c25118 +++$+++ That's a movie, you moron.
c00321 +++$+++ No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
c03481 +++$+++ Go ahead then.
c23967 +++$+++ That's good.  That's really good.  You have a gift for words.
c16247 +++$+++ Where we going?
c17838 +++$+++ Yeah. I guess I do.
c08709 +++$+++ -- okay, g'head --
c26956 +++$+++ Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
c23019 +++$+++ I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
c25279 +++$+++ Get to the point, will you...
c07091 +++$+++ So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
c20640 +++$+++ Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
c07525 +++$+++ Worse.  Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.  She's waiting in the lab.
c18015 +++$+++ If it came down to it what would you do?
c25782 +++$+++ Three Jacks.
c25936 +++$+++ I'm sorry he got those birds.
c10847 +++$+++ No.
c16172 +++$+++ I don't care who you are.  It's Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
c03938 +++$+++ Pardon?
c22379 +++$+++ You bring American money?
c25937 +++$+++ But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
c06203 +++$+++ Creasy. Pinta likes him.
c26877 +++$+++ All right, I owe you one Marv.
c10550 +++$+++ I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
c23144 +++$+++ Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
c20033 +++$+++ Gottingen.  That's in Sweden.
c15968 +++$+++ Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
c16706 +++$+++ In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
c06082 +++$+++ No, really, mate?
c07018 +++$+++ Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
c02108 +++$+++ You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
c18914 +++$+++ I tell you it doesn't exist!
c02116 +++$+++ No.
c27246 +++$+++ Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
c08882 +++$+++ Wie hat er's gemacht?
c18897 +++$+++ He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
c11334 +++$+++ Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
c17135 +++$+++ Wait... there's something else.
c22180 +++$+++ Please, kid.
c19373 +++$+++ I distract them from their banality for a few minutes. It's like a public service.  It doesn't mean much in the end. They're all going to die.
c00555 +++$+++ Yeah, you know.  In the walls, under the floor.  I was the ace.  I could hide better than anybody.
c18135 +++$+++ It's an order. Get everyone out now.
c13521 +++$+++ Okay, deal.
c16226 +++$+++ If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
c02029 +++$+++ You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
c03710 +++$+++ What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
c00056 +++$+++ Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
c04328 +++$+++ I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
c27368 +++$+++ It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
c13917 +++$+++ No, not for that one.
c02123 +++$+++ Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
c01608 +++$+++ The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
c10486 +++$+++ Heather, I'm stuck here.  Neither Chuck or Terry came in today.  I can't get away!
c05399 +++$+++ Her name is Death.
c14431 +++$+++ You came in there with this attitude...
c15739 +++$+++ It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
c17367 +++$+++ You think so?
c02936 +++$+++ I'll work on it, ma'am.
c22266 +++$+++ Is that right?
c24063 +++$+++ But, Wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
c21027 +++$+++ N-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
c03935 +++$+++ A brute.
c08382 +++$+++ You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
c08679 +++$+++ Oh, yeah. Good for him.
c11658 +++$+++ It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
c07724 +++$+++ For work.....
c17846 +++$+++ Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
c11588 +++$+++ Which part is that ?
c13255 +++$+++ Is that your car?
c05204 +++$+++ An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
c13684 +++$+++ Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
c05728 +++$+++ I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
c01925 +++$+++ Ask me?
c00330 +++$+++ I'm sure they're around.
c04280 +++$+++ I still don't.
c00300 +++$+++ Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
c20643 +++$+++ No, I don't wanna.
c25392 +++$+++ No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
c17468 +++$+++ What if I come back?
c25004 +++$+++ How's your hip?
c19427 +++$+++ If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
c17466 +++$+++ Is it something you've done?
c06037 +++$+++ Taken care of?
c11484 +++$+++ Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
c02995 +++$+++ Sense memory. I see you got to win the fight...
c15477 +++$+++ You know what they say about the early bird.
c01630 +++$+++ There ya go.
c27015 +++$+++ To love, you must be able to feel.
c21300 +++$+++ Gimme another hint.
c00325 +++$+++ Her belongings?
c13313 +++$+++ I don't dance.
c08867 +++$+++ I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
c25390 +++$+++ But... it didn't just get there by itself.
c26574 +++$+++ What is that to you...?
c00180 +++$+++ That's true.
c17109 +++$+++ What position did you occupy?
c05544 +++$+++ I'll drop a cow on the knave!
c10398 +++$+++ They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
c25901 +++$+++ No.
c15920 +++$+++ --Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
c18046 +++$+++ Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
c03906 +++$+++ Kirsty, I'm sorry... don't understand. I...
c26817 +++$+++ ...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
c22633 +++$+++ Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
c10410 +++$+++ Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
c07749 +++$+++ That's it.
c10735 +++$+++ I'm not pretty.
c26749 +++$+++ My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
c09335 +++$+++ No, I mean maybe we should back off a bit, you and me.
c13376 +++$+++ I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
c09826 +++$+++ I guess so.  She said not to be late.
c01764 +++$+++ What the fuck possessed you?
c25905 +++$+++ Junior spends time with his child.
c26987 +++$+++ Sweetheart--
c24991 +++$+++ Nursery?
c03096 +++$+++ You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
c27346 +++$+++ He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
c21388 +++$+++ I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
c00678 +++$+++ Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
c07512 +++$+++ She let it escape because she wants me to die.
c06897 +++$+++ He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
c06325 +++$+++ Go out and find her!
c02302 +++$+++ There's no rule!
c05082 +++$+++ You in trouble?
c04100 +++$+++ You're not from these parts.
c07880 +++$+++ I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
c24184 +++$+++ Ceida Pietraszkiewicz...P...I...E... T...R...A...S...Z...K...I...E...W... I...C...Z.
c21416 +++$+++ I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
c09377 +++$+++ Pierre... That's his name? Pierre? Is he French?
c16271 +++$+++ No. Like I say, he was funny-looking. More'n most people even.
c19876 +++$+++ Oh, the goddam party --
c23440 +++$+++ And what are you, his chaperone?
c10573 +++$+++ Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
c04238 +++$+++ They might be.
c22382 +++$+++ Mu-shu?  You're hungry?
c10179 +++$+++ What if he's not?
c02495 +++$+++ It's very late.
c25506 +++$+++ She... she fell over backwards.
c13671 +++$+++ Why?
c10370 +++$+++ I am The Muffin.
c13200 +++$+++ Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
c20971 +++$+++ And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
c23200 +++$+++ You're right.
c24083 +++$+++ And when did that pass?
c00040 +++$+++ I know, just let me sleep
c19124 +++$+++ Maybe you've got a knack for this... I guess we're about to find out.
c19337 +++$+++ What about death?
c20276 +++$+++ I was dead.
c05981 +++$+++ What safe place is that?
c24502 +++$+++ That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
c20925 +++$+++ My Dad.  He played in the minors for a while, when he got out of college.
c08519 +++$+++ We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
c20972 +++$+++ I thought you were leaving.
c09588 +++$+++ Well then check back tomorrow.
c18820 +++$+++ He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
c20197 +++$+++ Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
c08884 +++$+++ I do not want those cigarettes.
c26073 +++$+++ But how?
c00336 +++$+++ You just feel sorry for me.
c18645 +++$+++ I wouldn't mind going down with her.
c24217 +++$+++ No kidding.
c10769 +++$+++ How do you feel about that?
c22359 +++$+++ So I want the money and I want it now.
c06844 +++$+++ Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'Cause you been unemployed for a long time now, Craig.
c19914 +++$+++ Thanks.
c11919 +++$+++ Planet 10?
c10196 +++$+++ What kind of games?
c17068 +++$+++ Five thousand.  I kept half.
c27455 +++$+++ Food!!
c10127 +++$+++ The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
c16141 +++$+++ You always say that -- then you leave.
c05123 +++$+++ We will. There's something I've got to find out.
c11320 +++$+++ What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
c12635 +++$+++ Come on Dorothy.
c21243 +++$+++ And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
c18778 +++$+++ -- and I'll get 'em.
c12363 +++$+++ Ah. yes, the little door.  There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
c01731 +++$+++ I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
c04004 +++$+++ They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay?  It wasn't my idea.
c06429 +++$+++ Awwh, Charlie.
c20966 +++$+++ Fifteen million dollars.
c16869 +++$+++ It's for the best.
c21451 +++$+++ Where's Dad?
c01405 +++$+++ I can handle that.
c24262 +++$+++ Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
c06207 +++$+++ And they took that away.
c16829 +++$+++ What else?
c09391 +++$+++ Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
c24537 +++$+++ The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
c12280 +++$+++ Yes. It's very good, Eve.
c14841 +++$+++ Water?
c22487 +++$+++ I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
c16910 +++$+++ I'll take care of my end.
c05423 +++$+++ It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
c14572 +++$+++ You gonna forget about the money I owe you?
c24988 +++$+++ I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
c19487 +++$+++ You don't look half-bad.
c15587 +++$+++ You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
c01212 +++$+++ What?
c08427 +++$+++ You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
c19793 +++$+++ I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
c26805 +++$+++ We've got to put that, into the Inaugural.  "I have here, a ribbon.  You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."
c02486 +++$+++ Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
c04058 +++$+++ No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
c16979 +++$+++ That must be interesting.
c22655 +++$+++ Really?
c08348 +++$+++ Who was she?
c12387 +++$+++ Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
c02240 +++$+++ Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
c09526 +++$+++ Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
c01520 +++$+++ Okay.
c00649 +++$+++ What do you mean - now?
c09755 +++$+++ I was hoping you'd find out.
c23602 +++$+++ Where did you learn to kiss like that?
c09959 +++$+++ Yeah, I did. [Beat] He was my most memorable patient.
c05862 +++$+++ Say, you're an American, aren't you?
c24488 +++$+++ Maybe I could try --
c07940 +++$+++ Suppose he doesn't come back again?
c12073 +++$+++ Photojournalist.
c06016 +++$+++ Max offered to stake me.
c04846 +++$+++ Yeah, you got it.  Since you're the only straight shooter in that fuckin' office, I'd like an answer from you. Did you plant it?
c21567 +++$+++ Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
c11409 +++$+++ Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
c16232 +++$+++ If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
c26647 +++$+++ Yes.
c23843 +++$+++ My air isn't... I'm coming back.
c26123 +++$+++ I'm shocked.
c04594 +++$+++ I know the territory.
c17660 +++$+++ Right.
c08839 +++$+++ Why? It is a wrestling match, or...
c07304 +++$+++ Yes, but honey -
c12441 +++$+++ This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
c25339 +++$+++ Good.
c01479 +++$+++ You sure?
c17627 +++$+++ Now you understand?
c06551 +++$+++ Just fine.
c24343 +++$+++ Thank you.
c00862 +++$+++ Well...
c20453 +++$+++ Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
c13733 +++$+++ Yes.
c06350 +++$+++ Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
c15669 +++$+++ A lie.  What do you hate most?
c21878 +++$+++ Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
c14331 +++$+++ Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
c21482 +++$+++ But they...they could still be....
c22236 +++$+++ By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
c20009 +++$+++ What?
c03116 +++$+++ One we're producing.
c27454 +++$+++ What d'ya want to do to kill time?
c15675 +++$+++ Don't talk.
c02924 +++$+++ Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
c18175 +++$+++ They weren't loaded when I put them in there!
c17414 +++$+++ You're right!
c11547 +++$+++ That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
c16350 +++$+++ That... sawing and hammering.
c18616 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c22607 +++$+++ What can I do for you?
c16506 +++$+++ Alaska.
c24192 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c04343 +++$+++ I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
c01238 +++$+++ As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
c24801 +++$+++ I'll call.  I really will.
c18043 +++$+++ The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
c19185 +++$+++ Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
c23105 +++$+++ Oh, him. Well, he died.
c00969 +++$+++ Kiss me.
c01310 +++$+++ Lucky girl.
c20426 +++$+++ Did you play ARCADE last night?
c18294 +++$+++ We'll see if we can't make her well, Alma, you and I.
c08982 +++$+++ That's it?
c05840 +++$+++ I don't know.
c24571 +++$+++ The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
c15974 +++$+++ Okay
c07311 +++$+++ I been calling for four months.
c05637 +++$+++ She seemed upset.
c04273 +++$+++ You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
c27375 +++$+++ Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
c07856 +++$+++ Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
c12904 +++$+++ But.
c26825 +++$+++ War's over, Pal.
c00385 +++$+++ I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
c21355 +++$+++ Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
c08985 +++$+++ May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
c20148 +++$+++ Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
c09174 +++$+++ I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
c03828 +++$+++ I don't know.
c01294 +++$+++ But you didn't see it, right?
c14333 +++$+++ But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
c12381 +++$+++ Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
c04501 +++$+++ You think so?
c13604 +++$+++ No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
c16950 +++$+++ Can he trust you?
c08093 +++$+++ It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
c20019 +++$+++ Guess I've told you about my condition.
c06419 +++$+++ Because you'll never believe me.
c04493 +++$+++ Dad, how can you?
c03785 +++$+++ That's been said before.
c12254 +++$+++ Oh, Delia, lighten up!
c19750 +++$+++ And?
c18174 +++$+++ -- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
c02166 +++$+++ Wha?
c14964 +++$+++ How do you know that?
c15715 +++$+++ No!
c00090 +++$+++ What are you asking me?
c01456 +++$+++ You trust me?
c00088 +++$+++ I will if they don't send me back.
c25090 +++$+++ Win what?
c10882 +++$+++ Look into the convent records.
c08586 +++$+++ You're a doctor. What kind?
c01078 +++$+++ -- Stephen, this is bullshit --
c00289 +++$+++ I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
c15921 +++$+++ I recognize you only as my son, no more.
c08916 +++$+++ Surge from astern, sir. Aft quarter!
c13996 +++$+++ Brad, I'm -  I'm not an old woman yet -
c06857 +++$+++ 18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
c17318 +++$+++ Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
c06096 +++$+++ Heard where?
c09529 +++$+++ I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
c20801 +++$+++ She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over.  Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
c18501 +++$+++ Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
c09140 +++$+++ He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
c09251 +++$+++ Can't do it.
c21450 +++$+++ What's Dr. Gillman say?
c06347 +++$+++ Dinner's on you.
c08059 +++$+++ We're aware of your position.
c03128 +++$+++ Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
c22139 +++$+++ Apollo?
c20889 +++$+++ Bridgework?
c23842 +++$+++ But I don't know how --
c05712 +++$+++ Then you won't have no problem making the adjustment. You need anything, help of any kind, gimme a holler. Name's Jangle Leg.
c00936 +++$+++ I've got a girlfriend, remember?
c18248 +++$+++ Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
c05313 +++$+++ You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
c01718 +++$+++ Obviously. That's a given.
c02202 +++$+++ She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
c09215 +++$+++ It's bad.
c24177 +++$+++ The source was...shall we say, completely reliable.
c27226 +++$+++ You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
c01586 +++$+++ Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
c19131 +++$+++ Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in -
c27281 +++$+++ Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
c16341 +++$+++ In case we want to switch nights.
c21720 +++$+++ You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
c24433 +++$+++ Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
c22320 +++$+++ He would have done it to us, right?
c24226 +++$+++ Have you tried the emergency system?
c11235 +++$+++ Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
c08674 +++$+++ God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
c09927 +++$+++ We choose to believe it.
c23708 +++$+++ <b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
c01894 +++$+++ Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
c03671 +++$+++ You okay?  You seem a little off.
c17007 +++$+++ All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
c09582 +++$+++ You're not much with girls, are you?
c23091 +++$+++ Don't you ever stop?
c11979 +++$+++ What was she like in school?
c25447 +++$+++ Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
c27192 +++$+++ As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
c09320 +++$+++ There was talk of a file photo.
c09275 +++$+++ Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
c12325 +++$+++ What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
c20627 +++$+++ My Dad was funny?
c00644 +++$+++ Yes.
c10694 +++$+++ I got the message you called.
c15950 +++$+++ Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
c17088 +++$+++ Lingk.  James Lingk.
c03666 +++$+++ What?  Where is she?
c15931 +++$+++ Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
c18436 +++$+++ Well, what a lucky break for me.
c05216 +++$+++ A book on the warehouse murders?
c23828 +++$+++ Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
c22458 +++$+++ Got any last minute advice?
c27314 +++$+++ What if you1re wrong??
c14796 +++$+++ Goodnight.
c22596 +++$+++ You mean you're ready to give up?
c17126 +++$+++ For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
c20485 +++$+++ I'm listening.
c19923 +++$+++ Gay?
c12769 +++$+++ Objection!  Mr. Roston's sexual preferences are not at issue in this trial.
c26722 +++$+++ Go have fun. Not too much.
c07148 +++$+++ You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
c23078 +++$+++ Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
c25554 +++$+++ Did I give it to you?
c07860 +++$+++ Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
c03512 +++$+++ Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
c10804 +++$+++ Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
c17282 +++$+++ What happened to Sway?
c05420 +++$+++ Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
c06771 +++$+++ I wouldn't mind being famous.
c14553 +++$+++ Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
c20785 +++$+++ Where was your father born?
c21239 +++$+++ Go away, or I'll call the police.
c15658 +++$+++ As the wife of one of our party.
c26215 +++$+++ You and Robin moved?
c03472 +++$+++ Then why do you keep running away?
c04439 +++$+++ Better be. You left me for him.
c00403 +++$+++ I still don't understand --
c15694 +++$+++ Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
c25797 +++$+++ Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
c26569 +++$+++ What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
c05644 +++$+++ God, you look like crap, George.
c12793 +++$+++ No.
c02494 +++$+++ But you weren't. I could tell.
c09423 +++$+++ ...Okay, two...
c00579 +++$+++ What?
c15474 +++$+++ Fine.  So do your count.  Start with president, and I'll be right back.
c00382 +++$+++ Yeah.
c20017 +++$+++ Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there?
c25998 +++$+++ He hired you.  That was a mistake.
c25301 +++$+++ What if it is?
c19933 +++$+++ How long have I got?
c23731 +++$+++ Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
c22496 +++$+++ I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
c04580 +++$+++ Let you leave without it.
c25939 +++$+++ Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
c15294 +++$+++ We start our own class?
c06208 +++$+++ Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
c09635 +++$+++ I... no, I... I just can't...
c17182 +++$+++ This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
c06376 +++$+++ I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.  It's a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
c09336 +++$+++ Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
c02350 +++$+++ She did.
c24358 +++$+++ What happened?
c24904 +++$+++ And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
c08868 +++$+++ Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
c04991 +++$+++ I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
c01193 +++$+++ He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
c16383 +++$+++ We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
c02539 +++$+++ The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
c03308 +++$+++ Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
c23869 +++$+++ No.  I didn't say that.
c19147 +++$+++ I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
c21023 +++$+++ I'll talk to you in the morning.
c16481 +++$+++ <u>What</u>?!
c00848 +++$+++ What?
c07547 +++$+++ What would happen if I threw him into the core?
c00683 +++$+++ Now see here young man.
c07688 +++$+++ Yeah ...
c08381 +++$+++ Say, is Maya working?
c21639 +++$+++ I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
c25363 +++$+++ Many things...
c07501 +++$+++ Never.  They took Miss Swann.
c17877 +++$+++ Bye.
c17011 +++$+++ ...that's right...
c18236 +++$+++ You re not thinking of going to...
c26467 +++$+++ You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
c08913 +++$+++ Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
c14202 +++$+++ The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
c17177 +++$+++ Maybe.  But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
c10119 +++$+++ Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
c09441 +++$+++ Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
c09614 +++$+++ You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
c21945 +++$+++ You lie!
c19194 +++$+++ How is he?
c15207 +++$+++ Yes indeed.  You almost got yourself killed last night.
c26564 +++$+++ Listen to me, fella...
c04542 +++$+++ I'll get in trouble.
c03616 +++$+++ Sure.
c24548 +++$+++ Then -
c00998 +++$+++ Then what's stopping you?
c19174 +++$+++ Their arms?
c01671 +++$+++ Let him go or I will deliver you, right now.
c19508 +++$+++ Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
c11693 +++$+++ You changed the room around...
c11107 +++$+++ It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
c24255 +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
c11690 +++$+++ That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
c01508 +++$+++ Dickhead?
c20077 +++$+++ Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
c11362 +++$+++ Yes, I remember.  He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
c04562 +++$+++ Dieter!
c23939 +++$+++ I said no. Want me to pull rank ?
c24164 +++$+++ I insist...
c22830 +++$+++ I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
c20239 +++$+++ It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
c15909 +++$+++ I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
c10349 +++$+++ Did she ever mention any friends?
c18852 +++$+++ They're just doing what they do.  Well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
c05670 +++$+++ Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
c24630 +++$+++ How will he do that?
c02741 +++$+++ I know.  'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
c24023 +++$+++ "...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
c20410 +++$+++ You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
c08845 +++$+++ Jawohl!
c09730 +++$+++ Yes, I suppose so.
c26501 +++$+++ What if I
c19347 +++$+++ Okay.  I'll keep digging.
c05444 +++$+++ This guy's not a murderer.
c24049 +++$+++ I...
c06420 +++$+++ Just like that?
c07615 +++$+++ Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
c15972 +++$+++ No now.
c19322 +++$+++ Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
c16344 +++$+++ Please.
c11831 +++$+++ He wants to show now.
c04558 +++$+++ Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
c17304 +++$+++ There are cops all over the place.
c10620 +++$+++ How can you say that, Sailor?
c23871 +++$+++ I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
c03883 +++$+++ They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
c23695 +++$+++ That's gonna take a long time!
c15422 +++$+++ Both.
c04888 +++$+++ Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
c06608 +++$+++ My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
c02099 +++$+++ You called the casino a cesspit.
c24812 +++$+++ It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
c23158 +++$+++ He still having parties?
c07134 +++$+++ How come're you doin that?
c19053 +++$+++ Am I running away?
c14894 +++$+++ It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
c07154 +++$+++ I wouldn't worry about it.
c06719 +++$+++ These appointments were not my idea, remember.
c16532 +++$+++ I have to talk to you.
c01971 +++$+++ Shut up and go home, will you?
c04086 +++$+++ You're a fool.
c03342 +++$+++ Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
c23603 +++$+++ Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
c25948 +++$+++ Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
c18741 +++$+++ I have to finish my job --
c07427 +++$+++ Cheerful news to greet the morn.
c00086 +++$+++ Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
c26112 +++$+++ Not us, I hope.
c02297 +++$+++ He was a year ahead of us?
c24823 +++$+++ I'm really... honored to be part of this study, Jim.
c24731 +++$+++ I don't know what you mean, Major.
c13878 +++$+++ Avocado groves?
c10606 +++$+++ Just part of life on the road, peanut.
c04292 +++$+++ Aw, fuck.
c16626 +++$+++ 'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
c19134 +++$+++ Sometimes you do.
c05872 +++$+++ No porters here!!
c11004 +++$+++ That'll blow the ship up.
c17363 +++$+++ What places?
c26078 +++$+++ But he does seem familiar?
c09527 +++$+++ Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
c14129 +++$+++ Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
c21286 +++$+++ I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
c16659 +++$+++ 'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
c26371 +++$+++ Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
c24631 +++$+++ Nothing good on your T.V.?
c21252 +++$+++ And then they'll kill 'em.
c12285 +++$+++ Do you think so? Do you think so?
c18033 +++$+++ If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
c12907 +++$+++ You got a vision, girl.  Just like I got. Just like my momma had.  And the good Lord didn't give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  That's just wasted time.
c24092 +++$+++ What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
c16357 +++$+++ Marla...
c27045 +++$+++ No - not all the time - I mean
c21620 +++$+++ I've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  This man hadn't been dead an hour.  He wasn't killed last night.  He was killed today. In broad daylight.  That's no drunk- rolling job.
c09040 +++$+++ It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
c00363 +++$+++ But - what can we accomplish?
c06069 +++$+++ Yeah. I want it.
c16796 +++$+++ Why are you doing this to yourself?
c15627 +++$+++ How?
c05071 +++$+++ I would have stayed there if I could.
c17146 +++$+++ Whose orders are these?
c13706 +++$+++ Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
c00166 +++$+++ When are you coming home?
c26272 +++$+++ Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
c22963 +++$+++ Told ya, didn't I?
c26433 +++$+++ Did you get up from your seat?
c00826 +++$+++ Pick me up?
c01638 +++$+++ Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
c20108 +++$+++ Get the... midnight... express.
c11471 +++$+++ Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
c00623 +++$+++ No, please.
c07267 +++$+++ I hope you're right...
c05282 +++$+++ Shit. All right. But don't fuck with anything OK?
c00287 +++$+++ I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
c02923 +++$+++ And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
c12455 +++$+++ Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
c24766 +++$+++ Home.
c26468 +++$+++ B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
c00795 +++$+++ A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
c24188 +++$+++ Do you recognize my voice?
c13617 +++$+++ Depends what it is.
c12475 +++$+++ Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!
c24569 +++$+++ I hope she gets better.
c00717 +++$+++ No. You can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. We pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. You preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. Now you want our help. You want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. All right. There's one way you can get it. Give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
c12223 +++$+++ I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
c21936 +++$+++ [Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
c13095 +++$+++ I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
c00175 +++$+++ Any clue as to what it is?
c00754 +++$+++ Mine too?
c22886 +++$+++ Can I bring Kenny?
c24768 +++$+++ I'm not wearing underwear.  Okay? There, I said it.  Satisfied.
c07396 +++$+++ Who? I mean besides the FBI?
c03793 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
c21576 +++$+++ Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
c22869 +++$+++ You don't still think it was me?
c11563 +++$+++ A.W.O.L.?
c23800 +++$+++ You bet. For five bucks, I'll even throw in the tongue.
c06560 +++$+++ Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
c00513 +++$+++ I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
c17755 +++$+++ Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
c09055 +++$+++ That is not an acceptable option. If people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation...
c08597 +++$+++ You have nice red in your cheeks now.
c24682 +++$+++ Dyson.
c07648 +++$+++ Hear your Dad got a new car.
c03001 +++$+++ I knew it!... I KNEW it!...
c04807 +++$+++ In about fifteen minutes.
c18414 +++$+++ But you're the fairest by far.
c25071 +++$+++ Why?
c02822 +++$+++ Then why weep for him?
c14954 +++$+++ No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
c00196 +++$+++ Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
c11064 +++$+++ He does not exaggerate. I was good.
c17266 +++$+++ I dunno. Whatever will be will be...
c09479 +++$+++ I don't like you.
c01794 +++$+++ Don't you want answers?
c02258 +++$+++ Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
c04563 +++$+++ Gimme a minute.
c01915 +++$+++ Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
c18370 +++$+++ No one.
c14644 +++$+++ That's not fair.
c10508 +++$+++ Now?
c10293 +++$+++ Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
c24906 +++$+++ Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--
c12178 +++$+++ I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
c03853 +++$+++ Because if you are...
c24462 +++$+++ Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
c21033 +++$+++ You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
c26246 +++$+++ What's that mean?
c15554 +++$+++ I get the idea.  You got a description?
c13552 +++$+++ I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
c15373 +++$+++ So you're not gonna make the movie?
c11665 +++$+++ What's wrong with your son, anyway?
c12130 +++$+++ You are direct, aren't you?
c15025 +++$+++ The fuck I did!!!
c05460 +++$+++ Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
c13667 +++$+++ What?
c14986 +++$+++ No. None of that.
c01408 +++$+++ What'chu sayin'?
c17106 +++$+++ I didn't know the people who gave them to me.
c21763 +++$+++ Vivian's in sales.
c21353 +++$+++ You see us as capable of such a blow?
c22460 +++$+++ Good one!  Thanks.
c26824 +++$+++ ...brazen-it-through...
c20008 +++$+++ Just take it easy, this isn't my fault.
c10532 +++$+++ Jesus, you never told them?
c18864 +++$+++ I thought that was Ted Bundy.
c27427 +++$+++ You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
c03582 +++$+++ Take them back, Suzette.
c01136 +++$+++ I forgive you.
c03314 +++$+++ Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
c05236 +++$+++ Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
c19421 +++$+++ Must be a spare set.
c04865 +++$+++ Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
c15826 +++$+++ Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
c05904 +++$+++ of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
c13868 +++$+++ You know, I gotta tell you.  That really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
c06231 +++$+++ We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
c21359 +++$+++ What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
c19953 +++$+++ Are you threatening me?
c12545 +++$+++ Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
c12114 +++$+++ I've got to stop him.
c23451 +++$+++ I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
c24962 +++$+++ Not that big.
c25658 +++$+++ Now wait just a fucking-
c17198 +++$+++ You were a soldier?
c14518 +++$+++ I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
c12581 +++$+++ I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
c25125 +++$+++ Bigger and better.
c09550 +++$+++ Is there a firing range around?
c08440 +++$+++ She got anything good?
c11652 +++$+++ -- Forget it.  And try not to bleed on my throw rugs.  Why do this?
c12429 +++$+++ Don't know. Just shot up one day from a stump.
c27020 +++$+++ I don't know what you are!!!
c15281 +++$+++ You're just jealous.
c12518 +++$+++ Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
c17945 +++$+++ Me?  Listen, I don't give no interviews.  That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
c20233 +++$+++ This whole operation was a molehunt.
c12680 +++$+++ You happy, baby?
c21115 +++$+++ Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
c00231 +++$+++ I don't know what you're talkin' about.
c14273 +++$+++ That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
c20446 +++$+++ Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
c00700 +++$+++ Rudy Levine the shmuck?
c02406 +++$+++ The children! May I see?
c26020 +++$+++ Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
c19608 +++$+++ I love you so much.
c05525 +++$+++ You go to lady now?
c22713 +++$+++ Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
c16261 +++$+++ What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
c00276 +++$+++ She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
c04727 +++$+++ In anticipation of making you sick.
c09630 +++$+++ ... what?
c19414 +++$+++ Its bad for you.
c16953 +++$+++ What did he say?
c04512 +++$+++ THE WHAT?!
c26089 +++$+++ You are mad!
c18539 +++$+++ Oh, Mom -- I'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
c06398 +++$+++ What have you promised them?
c20131 +++$+++ How does a nice cup of cocoa sound?
c15033 +++$+++ That wasn't your plan, was it?
c20549 +++$+++ MOM!
c08500 +++$+++ We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
c13153 +++$+++ I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
c15620 +++$+++ Oh.
c15929 +++$+++ --I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
c24996 +++$+++ Maybe I feel like a teenager.
c20573 +++$+++ I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
c24220 +++$+++ I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
c18153 +++$+++ Please, please try one more time.
c18556 +++$+++ But that's what we're here to find out, right?
c16619 +++$+++ Don't tell me I can't --
c26879 +++$+++ Sell?
c20070 +++$+++ What...?
c04499 +++$+++ Then we'll die.
c20907 +++$+++ Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
c15557 +++$+++ Really?  What did White say?
c07077 +++$+++ How?
c00574 +++$+++ Yes.
c10820 +++$+++ Then why do you say them?
c18608 +++$+++ I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
c23874 +++$+++ Beth left?
c14224 +++$+++ Oh?
c06605 +++$+++ You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
c06178 +++$+++ Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
c07202 +++$+++ Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
c01854 +++$+++ Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
c22206 +++$+++ What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
c06179 +++$+++ Why not?
c11551 +++$+++ My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
c03947 +++$+++ No.
c04516 +++$+++ You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
c08529 +++$+++ Even the fall from the plane.
c03217 +++$+++ What does it stand for?
c00765 +++$+++ Are you sure?
c09191 +++$+++ It's in a green Mustang?
c22701 +++$+++ So, what's your point?
c14738 +++$+++ It got hit.
c07629 +++$+++ No she's not.
c26699 +++$+++ Call 911.
c25844 +++$+++ Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
c06478 +++$+++ I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
c05409 +++$+++ Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
c08832 +++$+++ I'm a photographer, remember?
c19247 +++$+++ You're dismissed, Private.
c08375 +++$+++ And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
c20489 +++$+++ What do you do with the company, if I might ask ?
c07359 +++$+++ You got an idea?
c15663 +++$+++ They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
c07353 +++$+++ The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
c10640 +++$+++ This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
c15869 +++$+++ There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
c00620 +++$+++ Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
c23183 +++$+++ Hey, I'm, you know --
c05886 +++$+++ It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned--
c18765 +++$+++ Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
c09099 +++$+++ You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
c01988 +++$+++ A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
c00917 +++$+++ Gary?
c03769 +++$+++ I'll kill myself.
c09643 +++$+++ Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
c23809 +++$+++ A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
c05383 +++$+++ Hand over your dinner.
c11638 +++$+++ Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
c19753 +++$+++ I haven't decided yet.
c01131 +++$+++ What's to believe?
c17521 +++$+++ WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
c25650 +++$+++ Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
c08838 +++$+++ You never know.  Go get some sleep.
c07573 +++$+++ I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
c21645 +++$+++ Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
c04046 +++$+++ What do you want to do?
c20943 +++$+++ To old friends.  And your new dreams.
c06515 +++$+++ Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
c06438 +++$+++ For being a bootlegger?
c23951 +++$+++ What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
c01085 +++$+++ Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
c21542 +++$+++ You want her that much?
c15070 +++$+++ She couldn't be gone!
c07617 +++$+++ He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
c05203 +++$+++ You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
c08468 +++$+++ It needs batteries.
c27430 +++$+++ If you like -- just hurry!
c19892 +++$+++ Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
c21443 +++$+++ Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
c10684 +++$+++ What would you call them then?
c16634 +++$+++ Who's Frieda?
c19592 +++$+++ I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
c20854 +++$+++ Never heard of him.
c19426 +++$+++ There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
c18939 +++$+++ Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
c01784 +++$+++ What?
c05395 +++$+++ You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
c18537 +++$+++ You have no idea what's happened to me.
c05615 +++$+++ Well, it's the least I can do.
c18646 +++$+++ We need beer....
c01341 +++$+++ Right.
c09238 +++$+++ I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?'
c21693 +++$+++ That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
c26235 +++$+++ Shot!  Who shot you?
c24889 +++$+++ Who's looking for you?
c01891 +++$+++ My husband is with me, too.
c25114 +++$+++ Exactly.
c12341 +++$+++ Now?
c06084 +++$+++ Nah, man...
c06525 +++$+++ You know, we're getting married.
c20646 +++$+++ Bed wetter!
c12147 +++$+++ Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
c10906 +++$+++ I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
c12007 +++$+++ You don't like punk rockers?
c06601 +++$+++ Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
c07866 +++$+++ Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
c26221 +++$+++ Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
c06246 +++$+++ The nurses Leo and me picked up last night. We got a date with them tonight.
c06720 +++$+++ He agreed?
c12983 +++$+++ Yes.
c26518 +++$+++ You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
c26966 +++$+++ I guess not.
c20416 +++$+++ I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
c11887 +++$+++ What happened to Dick Wilson?
c17977 +++$+++ A man?  Was it a dream?
c21635 +++$+++ Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
c24185 +++$+++ Be fair, Mister President.  Didn't we initiate the Human Reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons?
c18295 +++$+++ Are you trying to tell me that the Houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure Mrs. Holland?
c21999 +++$+++ Yeah.
c03556 +++$+++ Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
c09024 +++$+++ I believe I was successful in communicating our intentions.
c01167 +++$+++ Yep, you guessed it.
c20144 +++$+++ I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
c09019 +++$+++ It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
c08910 +++$+++ An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
c20720 +++$+++ I knew when I first met you.
c19466 +++$+++ Like you don't give her a hard time.
c25982 +++$+++ Is this bad for him?
c07040 +++$+++ Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
c11605 +++$+++ I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
c03099 +++$+++ That's what I'd do.  Make sure I got the right guy next time.
c13290 +++$+++ My parents have money...
c11647 +++$+++ Killing wildlife not good enough anymore, so you go on to bigger and better things.
c19511 +++$+++ you woke me up to tell me that?
c10758 +++$+++ Of course it is! That's why I'm telling you!
c23775 +++$+++ I have someone for you to play Blueface with Junior.
c06396 +++$+++ The car is part of the deal.
c09054 +++$+++ Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
c17758 +++$+++ ...they did it for a lark.
c10355 +++$+++ Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
c04319 +++$+++ And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
c26548 +++$+++ I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
c25708 +++$+++ Do you realize I have light eyes?
c10818 +++$+++ Yes, you should go.
c04662 +++$+++ What do you mean there is no family?
c27028 +++$+++ Stop it.
c19129 +++$+++ With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
c03746 +++$+++ Will you please go?  An emergency!
c05541 +++$+++ Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
c20372 +++$+++ No, no, no.
c21332 +++$+++ Yeah.
c16721 +++$+++ It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
c19896 +++$+++ Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
c12809 +++$+++ I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
c11396 +++$+++ Let me heal you, baby.
c27268 +++$+++ Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
c18440 +++$+++ You loved your wife, surely.
c16864 +++$+++ You will respect the law.
c21226 +++$+++ Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
c15309 +++$+++ Say it not lightly...  Do you know its meaning?
c07075 +++$+++ The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes" are gone ...
c19456 +++$+++ There you go.
c03156 +++$+++ Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
c07760 +++$+++ Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
c22212 +++$+++ Not much.  It's hard to talk.
c23177 +++$+++ Now, George --
c00417 +++$+++ Yes. Here's your ticket.
c04088 +++$+++ You want me to front for you.
c03337 +++$+++ They came from Ostrov in Eastern Poland.
c17711 +++$+++ Doesn't she look pretty?
c14094 +++$+++ Lovely story.
c05967 +++$+++ There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
c09338 +++$+++ That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
c06230 +++$+++ Please...
c09066 +++$+++ No, we're here to... rescue them.
c26406 +++$+++ You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
c01414 +++$+++ Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
c19384 +++$+++ But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
c06953 +++$+++ Get into bed.
c18466 +++$+++ Cool.
c03778 +++$+++ I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
c11661 +++$+++ Spencer is okay. You'd better start finding something else to do with your free time. If you can't feel good about this break and step out a little...  You ought to get Mr. Udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
c08665 +++$+++ If I say go to two, it's really one.
c18265 +++$+++ ...I'm sorry.
c12362 +++$+++ Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
c13340 +++$+++ No.
c01725 +++$+++ It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
c12226 +++$+++ Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
c19478 +++$+++ Just not my type, I guess.
c27005 +++$+++ Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
c00737 +++$+++ That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
c18060 +++$+++ That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
c12353 +++$+++ I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
c10713 +++$+++ That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
c27259 +++$+++ Ohhh --
c21208 +++$+++ You want to know somethin'--?
c02268 +++$+++ Why?
c11140 +++$+++ You want me to be the bastard.
c17960 +++$+++ I didn't ask him.
c01355 +++$+++ You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
c00515 +++$+++ What's that?  Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
c10923 +++$+++ Well --
c15823 +++$+++ Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
c00625 +++$+++ The man. He's here.
c11020 +++$+++ You have to...
c24055 +++$+++ He's got a gift for fiction.
c24003 +++$+++ I will.
c00065 +++$+++ I am, Your Eminence
c07674 +++$+++ What?
c12112 +++$+++ Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
c22783 +++$+++ I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
c18956 +++$+++ You were hired to look for Tom.
c14839 +++$+++ Where does it lead?
c07950 +++$+++ I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
c19424 +++$+++ No, I wasn't, actually.
c02599 +++$+++ I had it at four.
c18721 +++$+++ What color was it?
c01934 +++$+++ You love her that much?
c16723 +++$+++ I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
c16507 +++$+++ I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
c22928 +++$+++ All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
c15169 +++$+++ You gonna smoke the cigarette?
c03986 +++$+++ He's gone.
c09907 +++$+++ And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
c06834 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c06617 +++$+++ Oh, as bad as that, huh?
c08535 +++$+++ Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
c09688 +++$+++ How can you tell?
c09292 +++$+++ Testa?
c25997 +++$+++ You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
c16466 +++$+++ He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
c19381 +++$+++ And he's dead?
c22914 +++$+++ You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
c14419 +++$+++ I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
c27345 +++$+++ But programmable. And expendable.
c12419 +++$+++ Won't you be late for work?
c03325 +++$+++ It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
c19473 +++$+++ You were trying to make me look bad.
c23369 +++$+++ They have done nothing of the sort.
c00428 +++$+++ What happened?
c12609 +++$+++ What?
c15510 +++$+++ Till 19-fucking-70.
c14264 +++$+++ Look, I'm sorry --
c07837 +++$+++ Craig is one syllable
c27085 +++$+++ She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
c00748 +++$+++ No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
c07458 +++$+++ Huh?
c15538 +++$+++ Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
c05025 +++$+++ Louis, you're a life saver.
c12222 +++$+++ Slow down there, honey... I don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
c07258 +++$+++ Huh?
c18950 +++$+++ You're going back?
c24790 +++$+++ Are you still on mediction?
c17123 +++$+++ What is it?  Can I help?
c12409 +++$+++ You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
c14627 +++$+++ You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
c13324 +++$+++ I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
c02999 +++$+++ I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
c12559 +++$+++ --go!
c19235 +++$+++ You would take a pain in the arse full stop.
c18216 +++$+++ He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
c03756 +++$+++ You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
c19579 +++$+++ I need to sit down.
c16126 +++$+++ I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
c24588 +++$+++ And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
c04390 +++$+++ A day like any other. People come, people go.
c07985 +++$+++ They like you.  Okay?
c01836 +++$+++ Wallace's followers.
c01073 +++$+++ There can be no excuse for tardiness.
c07630 +++$+++ I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
c14717 +++$+++ She said something about that, Mrs. Reed -- but she didn't tell me it was the Farren house. I'll get my other hat and coat and go over there.
c07548 +++$+++ We were different people then.
c11712 +++$+++ Probably.
c26340 +++$+++ I didn't do anything.
c11745 +++$+++ Ten years later, here you are again.
c27004 +++$+++ Rowan.
c20788 +++$+++ It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
c19792 +++$+++ Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
c22045 +++$+++ That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
c15588 +++$+++ They come after you?
c11792 +++$+++ Yeah, Dave Walters.
c09556 +++$+++ Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
c09720 +++$+++ The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
c05706 +++$+++ Don't make me take them away from you.
c15534 +++$+++ It's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in...
c21798 +++$+++ I will never doubt again.
c20903 +++$+++ Better than I...
c15176 +++$+++ We can't stay here.
c10831 +++$+++ Listen, Marshal... As for there being reasons for going away, anyone of us might have three thousand of them. So you can assume that she had them. What I want to know, is it possible that the smugglers might have taken her aboard?
c10789 +++$+++ Guess that makes you pretty special.
c16970 +++$+++ And what was that?
c21591 +++$+++ Where's you get it?
c03273 +++$+++ What's the matter?
c15034 +++$+++ Tell Doucet that.  What was his rehabilitation training?
c17151 +++$+++ I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
c06565 +++$+++ Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
c10671 +++$+++ Oh.
c21393 +++$+++ Why don't you go lie down for a while.
c05768 +++$+++ I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
c21600 +++$+++ And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
c18023 +++$+++ Huge.
c12165 +++$+++ I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
c11283 +++$+++ M'm.
c27385 +++$+++ You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
c02641 +++$+++ Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
c09326 +++$+++ The other reason?
c05170 +++$+++ Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
c02203 +++$+++ On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
c10266 +++$+++ No options.
c22956 +++$+++ But Mose Harper said...
c02875 +++$+++ My children are not going with you, and that's that.
c11335 +++$+++ Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
c15796 +++$+++ I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
c06780 +++$+++ Or flowers.
c19471 +++$+++ That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
c13723 +++$+++ Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
c14690 +++$+++ P-whipped, p-whipped.
c14851 +++$+++ Bob...
c24490 +++$+++ Superman? Oh, was he here?
c12668 +++$+++ ... Sandy?.
c12562 +++$+++ --Cotter, where can I get on-line?
c20386 +++$+++ Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
c13594 +++$+++ I thought so.
c14570 +++$+++ I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
c22656 +++$+++ Tom, quit fucking around.
c06886 +++$+++ I'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
c13371 +++$+++ So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
c04082 +++$+++ People like that rarely leave business cards.
c13496 +++$+++ Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
c00398 +++$+++ The key, Wade.
c08183 +++$+++ In about fifteen minutes.
c09788 +++$+++ Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
c19779 +++$+++ It's so dirty.
c10748 +++$+++ Yes.
c11526 +++$+++ Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
c13715 +++$+++ Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
c08344 +++$+++ I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
c16282 +++$+++ Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
c05379 +++$+++ I have need of friends.
c19505 +++$+++ Funny.  I never did.
c25256 +++$+++ Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says 'closed to the public', doesn't it?
c26510 +++$+++ Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
c19107 +++$+++ <u>Kelly</u>--
c21001 +++$+++ Di Caprio.
c11594 +++$+++ Whatdoya think it thinks.
c15019 +++$+++ Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
c13000 +++$+++ Wait up --  -- just wait up --
c21902 +++$+++ Just wait here?
c17850 +++$+++ No.
c18804 +++$+++ That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were.
c20247 +++$+++ I'm willing to take the chance.
c27031 +++$+++ Maybe he's just - waiting...
c08439 +++$+++ This is good. Little hints of clove.
c21871 +++$+++ Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday.
c24224 +++$+++ Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
c06514 +++$+++ Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
c12991 +++$+++ ...they won't let you go...
c24233 +++$+++ Slides go with it.
c03643 +++$+++ But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
c03939 +++$+++ Just take it slowly.
c24291 +++$+++ No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
c15685 +++$+++ Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
c11360 +++$+++ Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
c04285 +++$+++ No, no, no it's so much more special than that... you'll see, you'll be the first to ever see. I think this is something you'll really love.
c16920 +++$+++ Really?
c10862 +++$+++ Why not?  Mmm?
c21654 +++$+++ And you'll join me in a sambucca?
c03904 +++$+++ It's coming.
c16055 +++$+++ I sing now?
c14220 +++$+++ Can you finish on schedule?
c17730 +++$+++ Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
c25734 +++$+++ Rush her.
c06726 +++$+++ Okay... let's say that, for now.
c05506 +++$+++ But maybe it's not what you think.
c01058 +++$+++ Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
c24519 +++$+++ Yes, darling?
c15224 +++$+++ Quit bullshitting.
c12117 +++$+++ I wonder if she'd go out with me.
c02395 +++$+++ Oh, no.
c19863 +++$+++ It's still sick.
c27113 +++$+++ I'm warning you.
c14275 +++$+++ You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
c23796 +++$+++ Can I come with you?
c08204 +++$+++ Well, Dottie, how come they're not here then, Fuck-Face?
c23081 +++$+++ Stop nagging.
c21047 +++$+++ Shit, Rose! What's there to decide? There's only four of us.
c24263 +++$+++ No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
c12167 +++$+++ How can you do that if she's already off the line?
c18395 +++$+++ Ran like hell to go to him...
c14699 +++$+++ Well please leave a message that I called.
c10335 +++$+++ No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
c06690 +++$+++ Why do you watch?
c12466 +++$+++ It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
c02390 +++$+++ Do you think they'll go along with us?
c03730 +++$+++ A trip, you mean?
c19461 +++$+++ I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
c08279 +++$+++ You are?
c16886 +++$+++ A day or so.
c21467 +++$+++ Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
c24866 +++$+++ And you've seen Eddie Rama.
c11372 +++$+++ Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
c16542 +++$+++ The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
c20092 +++$+++ Gonna be like money from home.
c06765 +++$+++ Have you considered my offer?
c07287 +++$+++ I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
c25362 +++$+++ When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
c10787 +++$+++ Not ever?
c05230 +++$+++ Yeah.
c11827 +++$+++ And I have no idea why.
c22969 +++$+++ All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
c20187 +++$+++ Not tonight.  Bad timing.  Sorry -
c26330 +++$+++ Mister, I'm calling you out.
c02314 +++$+++ Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
c25341 +++$+++ So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
c01858 +++$+++ What?
c12544 +++$+++ --do you <u>agree</u> it's that <u>old</u>, Nick?
c27098 +++$+++ You forget, I dislike YOU at least as much as him.
c15009 +++$+++ Promise! You gotta promise!
c03974 +++$+++ You want something to drink?
c12232 +++$+++ But <u>we</u> let him out.
c03125 +++$+++ A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
c13349 +++$+++ But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
c09576 +++$+++ Do they drug you?
c14974 +++$+++ Someone's back there.
c02850 +++$+++ For what?
c22095 +++$+++ We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
c27202 +++$+++ Tell you what - I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
c06568 +++$+++ Where do we go from here?
c20348 +++$+++ Blue.
c12683 +++$+++ George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
c22483 +++$+++ No.
c04915 +++$+++ What?... What'd you do?
c21067 +++$+++ 'Kay!
c20254 +++$+++ I always check the batteries.
c17525 +++$+++ Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
c20730 +++$+++ I mean...
c22074 +++$+++ What day is it?
c00220 +++$+++ Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
c00824 +++$+++ Can't you tell me anything?
c21277 +++$+++ Why not?
c00804 +++$+++ I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
c10809 +++$+++ Then how come you're not with him?
c26188 +++$+++ Naw naw!
c12158 +++$+++ How do I know you won't keep them all?
c00402 +++$+++ Low as what? What have I done? It's bad to want to see your own daughter?
c25891 +++$+++ Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
c01298 +++$+++ Sir, yes, sir!
c05292 +++$+++ I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
c11151 +++$+++ They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
c08731 +++$+++ I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
c13485 +++$+++ This is Nick.
c12628 +++$+++ It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
c12433 +++$+++ You don't know her? Judy? Works in the slaughterhouse.
c20269 +++$+++ But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
c06939 +++$+++ None of your business, Madam.
c05378 +++$+++ Perhaps he expected to eat it.
c15048 +++$+++ Wallet, cash, I.D...
c13411 +++$+++ How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
c07687 +++$+++ Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
c03895 +++$+++ I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
c17829 +++$+++ She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
c06335 +++$+++ I want it as soon as possible.
c03816 +++$+++ He deals in pain.
c16379 +++$+++ We don't need him...
c11058 +++$+++ She hasn't cut them yet, and you know it! So when you start judging an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by the barroom, Benzedrine standards of this megalomaniac society - I won't have it! Eve Harrington has never by word, look, thought or suggestion indicated anything to me but her adoration for you and her happiness at our being in love! And to intimate anything else doesn't spell jealousy to me - it spells a paranoic insecurity that you should be ashamed of!
c00544 +++$+++ This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
c26297 +++$+++ You know what I want.
c05231 +++$+++ Did you tell her that you loved her?
c12826 +++$+++ Hey, you know better than that.  What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
c16710 +++$+++ Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
c10287 +++$+++ Yeah...but no ties.
c25176 +++$+++ My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
c05519 +++$+++ Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
c24401 +++$+++ Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
c10231 +++$+++ Goose is dead.
c03668 +++$+++ You stole it?
c20396 +++$+++ Oh.
c14531 +++$+++ I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
c17063 +++$+++ Why should the sale not stick? Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm saying.  You have no idea of your job.  A man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm saying to you?  Your "end of month board..." You can't run an office. I don't care.  You don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  You ever been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
c12350 +++$+++ Suck my dick!
c20445 +++$+++ Yeah, sure. It is that kind of a day. When?
c22691 +++$+++ Lingerie.
c16335 +++$+++ Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
c15522 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c23298 +++$+++ SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
c24494 +++$+++ You're not selfish at all.
c23097 +++$+++ Yes.
c17597 +++$+++ I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
c08460 +++$+++ This one?
c15367 +++$+++ Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
c03351 +++$+++ That's a violin concerto.
c11298 +++$+++ Uh, narcolepsy.
c08996 +++$+++ You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
c22031 +++$+++ Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
c09845 +++$+++ I know, I've felt it...
c27381 +++$+++ I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
c24269 +++$+++ No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
c10577 +++$+++ You won't of missed much.
c02261 +++$+++ How much longer is this gonna last?
c12981 +++$+++ Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
c04377 +++$+++ Now and then. Why, do you?
c18104 +++$+++ What do you mean by that?
c11651 +++$+++ I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
c26432 +++$+++ Is that right?
c11103 +++$+++ I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
c26187 +++$+++ Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
c13393 +++$+++ Ace, listen to me.
c04194 +++$+++ It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
c25870 +++$+++ - Instant melt-down.
c13809 +++$+++ Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
c18968 +++$+++ I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
c26863 +++$+++ Yes.
c21648 +++$+++ Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
c07219 +++$+++ It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
c20958 +++$+++ You do volunteer work at the hospital?
c25111 +++$+++ So how many miles do you think it is?
c02714 +++$+++ Me?
c15992 +++$+++ Just the same.
c14813 +++$+++ She's just insecure. Once you get to know her she's fabulous.
c21324 +++$+++ Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
c08886 +++$+++ Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
c08379 +++$+++ So I guess that's it.
c12646 +++$+++ I'd like to talk to you about something.
c26198 +++$+++ Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
c14131 +++$+++ Twenty bucks.
c23650 +++$+++ What happened afta that?
c23456 +++$+++ Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
c02437 +++$+++ Yes... oh, yes...
c21505 +++$+++ I would rather we all stay--
c04278 +++$+++ God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
c17247 +++$+++ You mean the poor --
c00670 +++$+++ There is only one bed.
c06236 +++$+++ I'll see you around.
c00960 +++$+++ Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
c00701 +++$+++ The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
c21134 +++$+++ No... Like a psychiatrist.
c02681 +++$+++ Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
c25752 +++$+++ Never let go.
c26302 +++$+++ You said you couldn't kill anybody.
c26481 +++$+++ The Kid, yeah...
c11106 +++$+++ This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
c05792 +++$+++ Can you make it back?
c17460 +++$+++ It's always the little things.
c20047 +++$+++ I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
c24647 +++$+++ I didn't say that, J.J.
c14243 +++$+++ Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
c02224 +++$+++ Right, the big one-oh.
c24418 +++$+++ But I have to go back. I brought you here so you'd be safe. From her.
c25931 +++$+++ All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
c08528 +++$+++ Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
c26186 +++$+++ It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
c13618 +++$+++ I'm wondering why you keep his things.
c09388 +++$+++ I'm such an asshole.
c23594 +++$+++ Love it.  Which way?
c24178 +++$+++ And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
c17313 +++$+++ Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
c13025 +++$+++ Trouble with your air-conditioning.
c03717 +++$+++ I'd like to use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
c02098 +++$+++ I'll take you up on that.
c03422 +++$+++ Yes.
c00025 +++$+++ Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
c23868 +++$+++ On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
c04792 +++$+++ Hitch-hiking.
c21621 +++$+++ Would you?
c01311 +++$+++ You don't need a picture. Just look up handsome in the dictionary.
c17931 +++$+++ I read the probation report.  It's not good.  I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
c23943 +++$+++ Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
c25438 +++$+++ How 'bout a handkerchief?
c12912 +++$+++ I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
c11007 +++$+++ Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
c09952 +++$+++ Why?
c26255 +++$+++ Kathryn, you know he can't possibly know that.  You're a rational person. You're a trained psychiatrist.  You know the difference between what's real and what's not.
c02254 +++$+++ GOOD MORNING!
c06361 +++$+++ How do you feel after a shooting.
c23335 +++$+++ Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
c11986 +++$+++ Didn't you study it in school?
c16893 +++$+++ Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
c13925 +++$+++ So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
c04295 +++$+++ Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
c25993 +++$+++ Arizona.
c04462 +++$+++ But, Mr. President...
c19943 +++$+++ Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
c22223 +++$+++ How do you know that?
c16763 +++$+++ Boy scouting.
c24080 +++$+++ I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
c01424 +++$+++ But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
c19275 +++$+++ You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
c25378 +++$+++ So... bring up the reinforcements!
c02020 +++$+++ That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
c09651 +++$+++ They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
c22872 +++$+++ I don't think so.
c12878 +++$+++ Near the church.
c18423 +++$+++ You want death? Is it death you want?
c25704 +++$+++ Five, seven, and nine--
c24603 +++$+++ That's the local bar?
c10989 +++$+++ No, it's coming.
c17568 +++$+++ Up all night again, huh?
c17618 +++$+++ Don't you mean what you do best?
c01618 +++$+++ No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
c15354 +++$+++ Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
c18656 +++$+++ You just got here....
c04060 +++$+++ It's a great song.
c07588 +++$+++ You're my what?
c19819 +++$+++ Should I be?
c13048 +++$+++ Yes we have, Jack!
c19279 +++$+++ This is an official visit, then--
c19971 +++$+++ I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
c02504 +++$+++ Well, you obviously don't know me.
c10782 +++$+++ How young?
c02833 +++$+++ God took her from us.
c04729 +++$+++ No. You're not.
c16467 +++$+++ You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
c22892 +++$+++ They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it?
c02686 +++$+++ There's no hurry! The race is over!
c02448 +++$+++ Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
c08189 +++$+++ I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
c00151 +++$+++ Yes.
c02248 +++$+++ No.
c06665 +++$+++ I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
c03580 +++$+++ Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
c14494 +++$+++ Not a one.
c07326 +++$+++ I know.
c13871 +++$+++ An honest living.
c08725 +++$+++ Listen --
c17017 +++$+++ How?  Do something to hurt them. Where they live.
c11234 +++$+++ Also like sex with my wife.
c07128 +++$+++ Whatcha mean by that?
c16114 +++$+++ And I bet I've kept that promise ...
c00407 +++$+++ No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
c10374 +++$+++ What's going on?
c19909 +++$+++ Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
c00083 +++$+++ You tell that to them!
c26228 +++$+++ No, 1995 is the past.
c07831 +++$+++ Sorry to disappoint.
c19702 +++$+++ Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
c23253 +++$+++ A nigger!
c25827 +++$+++ My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
c12258 +++$+++ I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
c13518 +++$+++ Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
c24799 +++$+++ I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
c13162 +++$+++ Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
c25432 +++$+++ No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
c17245 +++$+++ Got it ...
c23604 +++$+++ Me?
c07543 +++$+++ That's going to fit me?
c24595 +++$+++ Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
c24609 +++$+++ Yes.
c17366 +++$+++ That must have taken you a long time.
c24202 +++$+++ Then there's no chance for recall?
c19983 +++$+++ Why?
c06107 +++$+++ Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
c12199 +++$+++ It is urgent, sir.
c11137 +++$+++ And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
c08607 +++$+++ Fuck you! If you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
c10462 +++$+++ Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
c25667 +++$+++ Your partner?
c12191 +++$+++ He's just parking the Governor's car.
c09597 +++$+++ You suppose?
c06563 +++$+++ Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
c11353 +++$+++ It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
c21200 +++$+++ ... .and you'll tell Johnny Friendly.
c17715 +++$+++ Yeah?
c18398 +++$+++ What was it?
c26728 +++$+++ Move the bodies.
c02270 +++$+++ Well...
c21323 +++$+++ Home of the brave!
c23143 +++$+++ I guess not...
c22566 +++$+++ The water tastes better in the kitchen.
c14764 +++$+++ I'm sorry. I didn't want you to think I was still a doormat.
c15411 +++$+++ You said a woman likes to be pursued.
c20604 +++$+++ Did she ever see Vada?
c01087 +++$+++ He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
c00925 +++$+++ I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
c03428 +++$+++ I thought he said by the monkey house.
c13675 +++$+++ Don't think that way.
c22933 +++$+++ Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
c17937 +++$+++ Bill, I got financial problems and...
c10589 +++$+++ Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
c24523 +++$+++ You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
c26602 +++$+++ And you like it.
c25960 +++$+++ You're not so old yourself!
c22154 +++$+++ No dollar.
c26903 +++$+++ The richest one percent of this country owns half the country's wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds of it comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulation to widows and idiot sons and what I do -- stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. Ninety percent of the American people have little or no net worth. I create nothing; I own. We make the rules, Buddy, the news, war, peace, famine, upheaval; the cost of a paper clip.  We pull the rabbit out of the hat while everybody else sits around their whole life wondering how we did it...  ...you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy are you, Buddy? It's the free market. You're one of us now...take advantage of it. You got the killer instinct, kid, stick with me. I got things to teach you...
c07929 +++$+++ Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
c27324 +++$+++ Coward.  Giving up.
c19267 +++$+++ Yeah. He lives here, right?
c21684 +++$+++ The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
c05690 +++$+++ That's why we won't take the train. Cookie showed me where there's a farm house. They got a boat there.
c25099 +++$+++ You remember me? Upstairs...
c26598 +++$+++ We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
c05281 +++$+++ Yeah.
c18442 +++$+++ No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
c13568 +++$+++ Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
c10482 +++$+++ Yes, but...
c21101 +++$+++ Why are you asking me this?
c10048 +++$+++ And this adversely affects me how...?
c25897 +++$+++ ... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
c15376 +++$+++ OUR picture?
c12525 +++$+++ Like what?
c20104 +++$+++ Just what?
c16805 +++$+++ Big mess every time.
c10959 +++$+++ Well, you stick to that story, son.
c22105 +++$+++ But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
c06020 +++$+++ Yeah, sure.
c11685 +++$+++ Were you asleep?
c25015 +++$+++ Of what?
c16599 +++$+++ Not our kind of people, you understand.
c14194 +++$+++ I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
c08073 +++$+++ I don't know, I've seen the business world.
c17429 +++$+++ Not tonight you can't. Want to walk back?--or you want me to whistle up some help and take you back?
c26438 +++$+++ He said...
c10076 +++$+++ Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
c19686 +++$+++ Jesus, man...
c02918 +++$+++ Of course, but there's more --
c23865 +++$+++ Is it coming from our own computer?
c25243 +++$+++ Some crazy guy.
c01668 +++$+++ Chest pocket.  Shit!
c12000 +++$+++ Did you ever tie him up?
c09984 +++$+++ I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
c01321 +++$+++ Son?
c00929 +++$+++ I don't know --
c08484 +++$+++ I want you out of town before the hanging.
c20341 +++$+++ I'm thirty-seven.
c02677 +++$+++ If you graduate.
c19924 +++$+++ 'To bed'?
c05353 +++$+++ Would you settle for pepperoni?
c03757 +++$+++ A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
c13517 +++$+++ No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
c23719 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c11536 +++$+++ For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
c16842 +++$+++ What do you want me to do?
c12453 +++$+++ Which one was Logjammin'?
c21867 +++$+++ Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
c02814 +++$+++ No, my dear. You must be mistaken.
c01025 +++$+++ In your operation.
c20258 +++$+++ You're welcome.
c20113 +++$+++ Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
c11056 +++$+++ I love you too. Good night, darling-
c15953 +++$+++ No, you don't understand. Your daughter-
c13206 +++$+++ You're saying stay away from him.
c18457 +++$+++ To get out of Southport?
c23501 +++$+++ Yes, please.
c02802 +++$+++ Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
c03720 +++$+++ A hundred dollars for breakfast?
c13089 +++$+++ No, no, that's impossible.
c04227 +++$+++ She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
c16276 +++$+++ What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
c02917 +++$+++ Standing right here in my office.
c02343 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c23112 +++$+++ Sorry?
c17405 +++$+++ That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
c08755 +++$+++ Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
c00484 +++$+++ He's carrying a bomb.
c15285 +++$+++ No, it was a complete waste of time.
c22225 +++$+++ Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
c05896 +++$+++ Yes.
c02034 +++$+++ Where are you going?
c00310 +++$+++ Will you watch it and see for yourself?
c18489 +++$+++ Go through with what?
c00080 +++$+++ There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
c18909 +++$+++ There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
c17134 +++$+++ What was it, so I'll know.
c19796 +++$+++ If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
c16147 +++$+++ Adelle?
c16911 +++$+++ You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
c16418 +++$+++ Does she have a cell phone?  A way we can contact her?
c02773 +++$+++ He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
c03483 +++$+++ Yes I do.
c19751 +++$+++ You're insane.
c01759 +++$+++ Well, don't blame me. I told you.
c21540 +++$+++ We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
c00498 +++$+++ It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
c15016 +++$+++ I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
c12172 +++$+++ That's it?
c06480 +++$+++ Uh huh. And?
c15521 +++$+++ You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
c06354 +++$+++ How can I help you with the particles?
c20103 +++$+++ Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
c25186 +++$+++ How do you know that?
c27036 +++$+++ Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
c03000 +++$+++ Yes but, we were wondering-
c12476 +++$+++ Just for making the hand-off?
c17220 +++$+++ Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
c23597 +++$+++ Have you tried?
c13899 +++$+++ Well, let's go.
c03684 +++$+++ Promise?
c06859 +++$+++ I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
c14257 +++$+++ Paid sick leave?
c02605 +++$+++ Reed?... Sue?
c04182 +++$+++ If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
c23795 +++$+++ Are you sure he's dead?
c12473 +++$+++ You mean--beyond pacifism?
c09898 +++$+++ We took a walk three days ago.
c16814 +++$+++ He'll hate it.
c23500 +++$+++ Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
c24000 +++$+++ What?
c25449 +++$+++ Mottola.
c17407 +++$+++ I didn't see nothin'.
c22115 +++$+++ Janet.
c00375 +++$+++ Sun's gettin high.
c25159 +++$+++ I've gotta kill some Jews, Kyle. I'm serious. I'm always talking about it. This time it's gotta happen.
c15866 +++$+++ Can you trust him?
c08386 +++$+++ Great. You look great.  You both do.
c23633 +++$+++ You pawned it.
c12100 +++$+++ Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
c20084 +++$+++ Who?
c10889 +++$+++ Who are you?
c06890 +++$+++ What are you supposed to do?
c24838 +++$+++ How'd you like to kill someone for me?
c00109 +++$+++ If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
c21276 +++$+++ Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
c09332 +++$+++ We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
c26017 +++$+++ Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
c11037 +++$+++ So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
c10563 +++$+++ Have now.
c21007 +++$+++ But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
c16973 +++$+++ You sure about that?
c01128 +++$+++ You don't know... nobody knows...
c05597 +++$+++ You're a good girl.
c11550 +++$+++ Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
c23657 +++$+++ Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
c19352 +++$+++ ...yes?
c19942 +++$+++ What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
c25539 +++$+++ Dorothy!  Is she here?
c13952 +++$+++ The L.A. River?
c10627 +++$+++ What?
c13843 +++$+++ Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
c13953 +++$+++ Ida Sessions wants to see you.
c09009 +++$+++ Or believe, I'll bet.
c16448 +++$+++ Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
c26627 +++$+++ No!
c12787 +++$+++ And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
c25093 +++$+++ Oh, he's very goad, sir. I've read quite a few of his books.
c15191 +++$+++ I said stop it.
c01523 +++$+++ Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
c04647 +++$+++ Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
c07969 +++$+++ Where did you get the gun?
c19927 +++$+++ For how long?
c02793 +++$+++ Oh, you...  ...ennh.
c05658 +++$+++ I wasn't sure.
c15774 +++$+++ I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
c21662 +++$+++ In radio we're different.
c23197 +++$+++ I just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that's all.
c03252 +++$+++ Really? Can I see it?
c24346 +++$+++ Into what? A lampshade?
c09487 +++$+++ And Rome.
c12920 +++$+++ I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
c18625 +++$+++ Believe me, I am.
c01255 +++$+++ Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
c13531 +++$+++ You gotta just look the other way.
c26941 +++$+++ You were in an accident?
c17450 +++$+++ --No.
c26780 +++$+++ How do you kill it?
c20564 +++$+++ Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
c12459 +++$+++ Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho, but I don't see what it has to do with--do you have any kalhua?
c08590 +++$+++ What kind of words?
c09709 +++$+++ How long have they been gathering there?
c02651 +++$+++ I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
c07466 +++$+++ No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
c02342 +++$+++ But you're my father -
c05251 +++$+++ I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
c17372 +++$+++ Why? So I can realize she's not so smart. That she's boring. You don't get it. Right now she's perfect, I don't want to ruin that.
c12978 +++$+++ okay, all right.
c23904 +++$+++ At least you're doing something... I'd give anything to be in your position.
c03364 +++$+++ Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
c18362 +++$+++ Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
c15392 +++$+++ I thought this was a group effort.
c15482 +++$+++ Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
c01842 +++$+++ In my heart I had begun to hope that he would never break.
c21213 +++$+++ Leave her alone, I tell you!
c03818 +++$+++ I can stop if you want.
c16483 +++$+++ Him...?
c02344 +++$+++ Yes -- why?
c21454 +++$+++ I said my earrings <u>are</u> American. They're African-American.
c16440 +++$+++ Intelligence work.
c07981 +++$+++ I've got a gun.
c24727 +++$+++ What?
c00685 +++$+++ Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
c09844 +++$+++ When?
c12269 +++$+++ He does...?
c06931 +++$+++ Will you buy me a choclit sody?
c20354 +++$+++ They cost fifty pounds each!
c08901 +++$+++ Yes.  Thank you.
c07477 +++$+++ You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
c12169 +++$+++ Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
c00244 +++$+++ So, just how big was this fare?
c00252 +++$+++ Why not?
c11611 +++$+++ How big it is?
c10025 +++$+++ No.
c23717 +++$+++ Check.
c10033 +++$+++ Go.
c01966 +++$+++ Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
c19041 +++$+++ Where is Alsace?
c27461 +++$+++ Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
c18505 +++$+++ It will?
c25740 +++$+++ Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
c26015 +++$+++ She hasn't called you?
c22327 +++$+++ Do you have everything?
c00546 +++$+++ Now, wait a second --
c16094 +++$+++ So, what happened?
c09486 +++$+++ This is so good of you.
c15766 +++$+++ Tina was a wonderful woman.
c22558 +++$+++ Will she scratch up your back?
c17704 +++$+++ It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
c25558 +++$+++ He's just been for a walk.
c11516 +++$+++ Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
c15579 +++$+++ Yes.
c11559 +++$+++ A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
c21433 +++$+++ Get it?
c18333 +++$+++ Yeah, that one.
c24701 +++$+++ Not yet.
c00516 +++$+++ Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
c11788 +++$+++ What are you on about?
c09374 +++$+++ Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
c18984 +++$+++ Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
c21032 +++$+++ What for?
c10621 +++$+++ No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
c06822 +++$+++ All right -- I promise.
c01446 +++$+++ Bullshit, Nick.  And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
c00615 +++$+++ How could I not?
c07846 +++$+++ You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
c02447 +++$+++ You'll be sucked down too!
c10857 +++$+++ Anything?
c15301 +++$+++ He wishes to inform you that Vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly -- is still alive. He does not wish to meet or speak with you.
c13641 +++$+++ What would you do for me?
c01565 +++$+++ No.
c25553 +++$+++ You did.
c19908 +++$+++ My Doctor Lady?
c09834 +++$+++ What's wrong?  Tell me.
c08936 +++$+++ Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
c15074 +++$+++ Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
c14347 +++$+++ Like it or not.
c20815 +++$+++ What's eatin' you, Jocko?
c14393 +++$+++ Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
c09426 +++$+++ But your daughter is still alive.
c12395 +++$+++ No.
c06014 +++$+++ Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
c08842 +++$+++ Loonytunes.  And yet...
c22472 +++$+++ It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
c01005 +++$+++ Did he say who?
c18375 +++$+++ Watching what?
c25789 +++$+++ Sure.
c12264 +++$+++ Would you care to take it, sir?
c06794 +++$+++ Our lives, the revolution, my career?
c25456 +++$+++ You know anything about him?
c17562 +++$+++ ...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
c17264 +++$+++ Thank-you ...
c22124 +++$+++ Oh my, my,
c04838 +++$+++ The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
c04309 +++$+++ You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
c07645 +++$+++ BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TURN THIS COURTROOM INTO A CIRCUS!
c09046 +++$+++ I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
c25959 +++$+++ I like plaits.
c21839 +++$+++ Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
c27102 +++$+++ Come on.
c14536 +++$+++ But you were there?
c10454 +++$+++ That's right.
c23319 +++$+++ Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
c23502 +++$+++ That's obvious.
c18244 +++$+++ Wow, you were "in the joint." "Doing hard time."  It's funny, but that excites me.  I seem to have a thing for sinners.
c22784 +++$+++ What?
c02515 +++$+++ I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
c16142 +++$+++ ... That's great.
c20805 +++$+++ My kids want me to teach them.
c18078 +++$+++ I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
c18803 +++$+++ It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
c17194 +++$+++ I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
c10008 +++$+++ She thinks he's a pig.
c18454 +++$+++ Never do that again.
c06351 +++$+++ I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
c18019 +++$+++ I would like to say goodbye.
c26242 +++$+++ If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
c22372 +++$+++ Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
c25419 +++$+++ But I want to help, I want to.
c22333 +++$+++ Two thousand...
c14807 +++$+++ I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
c14462 +++$+++ This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
c03241 +++$+++ Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
c23459 +++$+++ And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
c10407 +++$+++ I completely understand...
c21611 +++$+++ You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
c18649 +++$+++ Where's my mother?
c25668 +++$+++ No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
c12840 +++$+++ Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
c23400 +++$+++ But maybe just for awhile --
c11204 +++$+++ ...I've never tried it.
c07980 +++$+++ Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
c24826 +++$+++ I don't know.
c08362 +++$+++ YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
c26531 +++$+++ And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
c22258 +++$+++ Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
c06774 +++$+++ And what if you get killed?
c07417 +++$+++ The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
c16345 +++$+++ No, thanks.
c20336 +++$+++ Well, what are you then?
c00530 +++$+++ Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
c14980 +++$+++ They did too!
c11464 +++$+++ Of course not --
c10950 +++$+++ Well we know that but what's he doing here?
c23099 +++$+++ It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
c00208 +++$+++ Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
c13762 +++$+++ Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
c17294 +++$+++ The bag with the envelopes.
c22993 +++$+++ And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
c23331 +++$+++ Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
c14783 +++$+++ So pee? Here?
c00347 +++$+++ But Dad --
c14956 +++$+++ He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
c07034 +++$+++ May I ask why?
c00948 +++$+++ You mean Mrs. Kensington?
c10493 +++$+++ This is going to give you nightmares.
c04364 +++$+++ Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
c04366 +++$+++ Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
c03009 +++$+++ It's... I don't know.
c13849 +++$+++ Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
c15893 +++$+++ All right, so I made another deal.
c25634 +++$+++ Drug evasion with assorted perversions
c23233 +++$+++ Do you have something against traveling?
c19607 +++$+++ hey.
c11644 +++$+++ There's a snowmobile. Inside a day we could be on the Yukon.  I got money there.  Remember that five thousand?  Make it ten.  Be smart.  Take it and walk away.
c07693 +++$+++ You look nervous.
c15195 +++$+++ Not really.
c06516 +++$+++ It was?
c01170 +++$+++ Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
c14810 +++$+++ Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
c04705 +++$+++ So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
c00050 +++$+++ Hearsay.
c06830 +++$+++ Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
c08554 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c26039 +++$+++ I'd really rather take care of it myself.
c11744 +++$+++ Yes.
c23598 +++$+++ Have you ever tried American girls?
c06799 +++$+++ Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
c07961 +++$+++ Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
c00778 +++$+++ It was exciting.
c23726 +++$+++ Then we've got to get to the lifepods!
c22544 +++$+++ It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
c22553 +++$+++ What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
c27244 +++$+++ Whenever you wish.
c18660 +++$+++ I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
c24504 +++$+++ Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
c02366 +++$+++ Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
c01535 +++$+++ I know first aid!
c04819 +++$+++ But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
c19416 +++$+++ Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
c21298 +++$+++ The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
c09008 +++$+++ Go ahead.
c26839 +++$+++ If we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
c25053 +++$+++ "Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
c19073 +++$+++ You ready on shore?
c11011 +++$+++ Not yet.
c10074 +++$+++ I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
c02520 +++$+++ We haven't checked.
c27312 +++$+++ Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
c15718 +++$+++ Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
c13408 +++$+++ You can trust me.
c25262 +++$+++ You... You found that at Leon's?
c09982 +++$+++ That sounds nice.
c13567 +++$+++ 259-7881.
c03460 +++$+++ A single. Just for myself, please.
c19536 +++$+++ C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
c01127 +++$+++ And the world -- the whole world.
c25294 +++$+++ Where is it?
c03292 +++$+++ All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
c16722 +++$+++ She just died, your mother just died?
c26021 +++$+++ Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
c25929 +++$+++ I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
c18718 +++$+++ No.
c23851 +++$+++ Not believing you.
c11987 +++$+++ Do you?
c14517 +++$+++ How's work going?    Are you back at school?
c05575 +++$+++ Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
c01998 +++$+++ The place is falling apart.
c17605 +++$+++ Why not?
c27451 +++$+++ Yes, I will.
c25754 +++$+++ You think she was really there?
c21525 +++$+++ Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?
c17388 +++$+++ Sounds good, where are you now?
c18431 +++$+++ I didn't want to kill her.
c26475 +++$+++ God damn it, Bill, it's rainin'.
c10613 +++$+++ What's that?
c20284 +++$+++ You're late!
c17881 +++$+++ I don't wanna be in bloody school!
c01525 +++$+++ Yes!
c09621 +++$+++ That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
c24849 +++$+++ Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
c14742 +++$+++ And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
c09289 +++$+++ Right.  That explains it.
c00688 +++$+++ In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
c14171 +++$+++ I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open the door to strangers after dark.
c05809 +++$+++ Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
c15222 +++$+++ Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
c19140 +++$+++ What's that, Dr. Lecter?
c05210 +++$+++ Turkey mostly.
c17771 +++$+++ I won't take much of his time.
c06261 +++$+++ I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
c23201 +++$+++ -- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
c01327 +++$+++ That's because most of it never happened.
c09824 +++$+++ 'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
c15185 +++$+++ Your son... and your nephew have been kidnapped by these crazy game show hosts from the Fox network. <b> INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Cigliuti sits up in bed.
c02229 +++$+++ Huh?
c26136 +++$+++ Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
c05959 +++$+++ The mall?
c27054 +++$+++ But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
c10068 +++$+++ Lint?
c12556 +++$+++ My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
c03875 +++$+++ With God?
c03176 +++$+++ We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
c08035 +++$+++ I love you, Nick...
c08378 +++$+++ Huh.
c17010 +++$+++ I...
c21835 +++$+++ Nobody's hearing nothing!
c07283 +++$+++ Better.
c20507 +++$+++ Bruce has just awaken.
c00018 +++$+++ How many people go here?
c26454 +++$+++ But... if he doesn't miss?
c21242 +++$+++ He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
c20039 +++$+++ I got to talk to my ADO...
c09153 +++$+++ As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
c07425 +++$+++ Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
c25396 +++$+++ Yes...
c21653 +++$+++ And some of that.  Sorry.
c13373 +++$+++ I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
c06900 +++$+++ What gives?
c08834 +++$+++ Do ya? Lemme give you the number for Bellevue.  That's 561-5151--
c14843 +++$+++ Why?
c00328 +++$+++ Kincaid and Joey died last night.
c12498 +++$+++ Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want us to go?
c15811 +++$+++ Erin --
c05775 +++$+++ I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
c05157 +++$+++ No, I mean in your pregnancy.
c11996 +++$+++ About three months before I met you.
c00659 +++$+++ Is David acting strangely?
c17338 +++$+++ Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
c11575 +++$+++ What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
c10189 +++$+++ You ever fly an F-14?
c02746 +++$+++ Does Clifford even know?  You didn't tell him, did you?  I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
c02078 +++$+++ I gotta go get a haircut.
c03686 +++$+++ Jamie?  But I thought she was --
c16436 +++$+++ Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
c08683 +++$+++ -- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
c10697 +++$+++ Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
c12813 +++$+++ Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
c01908 +++$+++ I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
c14725 +++$+++ She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
c18780 +++$+++ Let's go the zoo.
c18497 +++$+++ A boy?
c17032 +++$+++ I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
c16431 +++$+++ Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
c13734 +++$+++ Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
c08505 +++$+++ Why would they stop you?
c01117 +++$+++ I was ahead of my time.
c25316 +++$+++ Haven't you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I'd have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
c13744 +++$+++ How's that?
c16463 +++$+++ ... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
c18888 +++$+++ The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
c18096 +++$+++ Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
c23148 +++$+++ He's a very private person, actually.
c13104 +++$+++ He's better.
c12260 +++$+++ I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
c17626 +++$+++ What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
c09064 +++$+++ The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion negotiations.
c07852 +++$+++ It's just that my movie is so-
c25508 +++$+++ He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
c04038 +++$+++ He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
c25170 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c00077 +++$+++ My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
c08559 +++$+++ She still with Kent?
c10099 +++$+++ I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
c15357 +++$+++ I'm going to my mother's.
c04416 +++$+++ It's never gonna be done.  You love puttering out there too much.
c13787 +++$+++ Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
c08412 +++$+++ Right now.
c20032 +++$+++ Your name's Teddy.
c01133 +++$+++ You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
c03191 +++$+++ I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
c17637 +++$+++ Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
c25467 +++$+++ He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
c04668 +++$+++ Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
c12608 +++$+++ Thanks Meurice.
c05266 +++$+++ Who, Benny's little sister?
c04352 +++$+++ See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
c07223 +++$+++ Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
c19628 +++$+++ ..sorry...
c05142 +++$+++ I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
c09802 +++$+++ You think it's all right for you to stay here?
c24369 +++$+++ Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
c01329 +++$+++ We rented a car.
c08201 +++$+++ No woman would!
c02925 +++$+++ Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
c27267 +++$+++ Whozat?
c01191 +++$+++ C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
c21594 +++$+++ Then there isn't much I can do, is there?
c14740 +++$+++ Mommy read it to ne.
c23721 +++$+++ There is a high level...of passenger 					dissatisfaction.
c06861 +++$+++ Call me.
c09999 +++$+++ Maybe.
c20099 +++$+++ Sixty Lira?
c23509 +++$+++ Closer to eight.
c18120 +++$+++ I'll be over.
c15078 +++$+++ What does it mean here -- about my soul?
c01494 +++$+++ What's up?
c02667 +++$+++ What's Doug do in Chicago?
c04334 +++$+++ Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
c21293 +++$+++ Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
c18143 +++$+++ Let's have dinner first.
c06539 +++$+++ Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?
c04318 +++$+++ Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
c24056 +++$+++ I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
c12943 +++$+++ Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
c24139 +++$+++ Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
c02061 +++$+++ So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
c12115 +++$+++ Then you never loved me?
c21976 +++$+++ A place you've never been.
c02043 +++$+++ Try to look at it *this* way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator!
c04900 +++$+++ Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
c25411 +++$+++ Yes, please.
c05574 +++$+++ My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
c23952 +++$+++ To join, and become One with the Creator?
c08823 +++$+++ I hate--
c12537 +++$+++ No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
c12682 +++$+++ Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
c02657 +++$+++ All right.
c17663 +++$+++ Hmm?
c17105 +++$+++ John...
c26394 +++$+++ He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
c21086 +++$+++ He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
c05757 +++$+++ Your own work?
c14090 +++$+++ Five hundred dollars.
c25041 +++$+++ I need you on this, Scully --
c15312 +++$+++ No one. It... seemed the proper way.
c20342 +++$+++ Well ... I AM king.
c27242 +++$+++ But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
c12925 +++$+++ But --
c16676 +++$+++ Are you having trouble raising the half million?
c25483 +++$+++ I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit in this state.
c12967 +++$+++ He was in love with you, right?
c08092 +++$+++ Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
c22958 +++$+++ You fit a lot of descriptions.
c21971 +++$+++ You're insane.
c17644 +++$+++ As usual, I don't have anything to do.
c18197 +++$+++ I want this one, daddy.
c23642 +++$+++ Can you swim?
c20237 +++$+++ You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
c12621 +++$+++ Can I feel 'em?
c02934 +++$+++ You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
c12956 +++$+++ I don't, really.  I was referred to him.
c14557 +++$+++ This kind.
c04085 +++$+++ I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
c13933 +++$+++ Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
c25476 +++$+++ What the hell for?
c13021 +++$+++ -- but it was <u>him</u> --
c05493 +++$+++ Was she carrying a weapon?
c24342 +++$+++ Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
c26243 +++$+++ I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
c18113 +++$+++ Will you protect us.
c16144 +++$+++ Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
c03764 +++$+++ How horrible.
c17621 +++$+++ You look sharp. You understand?
c25772 +++$+++ Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
c26975 +++$+++ Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
c02215 +++$+++ At least he didn't swing with your ride.
c23482 +++$+++ Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
c15861 +++$+++ How do I look?
c27043 +++$+++ I heard something like that
c25944 +++$+++ Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
c10306 +++$+++ -- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
c07655 +++$+++ He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
c07240 +++$+++ Did you love it?
c23838 +++$+++ Don't tell me to calm down!
c22346 +++$+++ Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
c20529 +++$+++ What??
c01950 +++$+++ Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
c10230 +++$+++ Oh, you mean the thrill!
c08230 +++$+++ It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
c09795 +++$+++ You must have come a long way.
c04768 +++$+++ See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
c02675 +++$+++ Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
c02334 +++$+++ I will if you shut your piehole.
c00183 +++$+++ Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
c27010 +++$+++ Eighty million doll --- ?
c09946 +++$+++ What for?
c06391 +++$+++ You talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  Shit, I thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "M" word.
c24454 +++$+++ No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
c11477 +++$+++ Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
c24028 +++$+++ Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
c21351 +++$+++ Well which of those three ya want fixed?
c23513 +++$+++ And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
c24393 +++$+++ Goodbye.  Norma.
c04315 +++$+++ Really?
c10015 +++$+++ Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
c12424 +++$+++ Sure he knew her. Her boy Halle, too.
c02809 +++$+++ At one. Promise?
c25564 +++$+++ I hope you're well.
c06628 +++$+++ Where?
c16211 +++$+++ Sweet.
c14421 +++$+++ They all have one...
c15110 +++$+++ Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
c02038 +++$+++ One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
c13462 +++$+++ All right?
c05811 +++$+++ What's up?
c17884 +++$+++ It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
c03343 +++$+++ Yeah, what did we do, Ray?  The last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
c11790 +++$+++ I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
c09967 +++$+++ [Beat] How do you know?
c14405 +++$+++ I think this is number three...
c02971 +++$+++ I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
c20845 +++$+++ You'll be linked during the entire operation.
c12509 +++$+++ Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
c09250 +++$+++ Maybe.
c03064 +++$+++ Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
c18555 +++$+++ The Shark's mouth.
c17399 +++$+++ --But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
c06127 +++$+++ I assumed...
c24607 +++$+++ The problem is I have no idea who I'm talking to right now.
c00292 +++$+++ That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
c01681 +++$+++ I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
c14907 +++$+++ Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
c00034 +++$+++ You didn't
c01062 +++$+++ Ha, ha, ha.
c21967 +++$+++ I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
c07552 +++$+++ Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
c11549 +++$+++ Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
c03074 +++$+++ And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
c26332 +++$+++ You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
c00256 +++$+++ I told you not to read all that crap!
c26028 +++$+++ Jesus.
c17310 +++$+++ Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
c01778 +++$+++ Social issues. Crime prevention.
c03826 +++$+++ What are you paying me for?
c05000 +++$+++ She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
c27396 +++$+++ Oh, shit.
c20741 +++$+++ Try to keep it to a minimum.
c26667 +++$+++ What is it, a still life?
c22813 +++$+++ Stay under the safety light. Help is on its way.
c04173 +++$+++ All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
c21825 +++$+++ Sorry.
c26364 +++$+++ Harlin around?
c13676 +++$+++ Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
c08193 +++$+++ "Fucked me."
c16396 +++$+++ This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
c16485 +++$+++ Parry... I'm Jack.
c09816 +++$+++ Well, how do I know who you are?
c00955 +++$+++ Why not? It's a question.
c03722 +++$+++ No.
c25255 +++$+++ Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside --- where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
c05408 +++$+++ Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
c24319 +++$+++ WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
c22381 +++$+++ You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
c18159 +++$+++ The staff and guests! How many?
c08087 +++$+++ What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
c00505 +++$+++ Did you decide on a runway yet?
c23672 +++$+++ I just got out here!
c04258 +++$+++ No, no I think it's really interesting.
c22955 +++$+++ Yes.  Look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here.
c08340 +++$+++ Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
c01497 +++$+++ Same thing.
c25692 +++$+++ Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
c26233 +++$+++ What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
c05863 +++$+++ All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
c25815 +++$+++ --and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
c05992 +++$+++ Right here.
c22289 +++$+++ It has it's moments.  Course, you get cancer and die, that's the down side.
c23032 +++$+++ It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
c27160 +++$+++ It doesn't look like it.
c02766 +++$+++ Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
c11206 +++$+++ I don't want to dupe her, Jessica.  If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
c01302 +++$+++ Fine, you do it.
c26451 +++$+++ There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
c03183 +++$+++ Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
c10340 +++$+++ Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
c06064 +++$+++ What about it?
c06793 +++$+++ Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
c08255 +++$+++ Tell me what?
c18255 +++$+++ The Shazzammeter!
c07269 +++$+++ Like... us?
c18000 +++$+++ That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
c05270 +++$+++ Its like. But it gets boring. It's boring.
c13289 +++$+++ Yeah... She's okay, though.
c01460 +++$+++ But not to last.
c09475 +++$+++ The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
c22623 +++$+++ It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
c06839 +++$+++ Naw, I already ate.
c18886 +++$+++ You're detestable.
c26196 +++$+++ Tell me.
c20220 +++$+++ There was nobody on the bridge.
c20930 +++$+++ Well, what am I supposed to do?
c03056 +++$+++ Don't condescend to me!  We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
c17632 +++$+++ Sure, see you later.
c14928 +++$+++ Yes sir.
c22070 +++$+++ Wh... what... ?!
c21602 +++$+++ What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
c12823 +++$+++ You don't need anybody.
c25637 +++$+++ You don't have to... I don't trust him.  You ought to file a report.
c20607 +++$+++ Goodnight Shelly.
c20677 +++$+++ Lower.
c00647 +++$+++ Well, the play makes a hero out of a valet. He outwits his noble master and exposes him as a lecher. Do you see the implications? This would be, in a grander situation, as if a Chamberlain were to expose an Emperor.
c03747 +++$+++ And you come into Mrs. Ryan's apartment as often as you please, looking into various health matters?
c07869 +++$+++ You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
c09164 +++$+++ It's working.
c12688 +++$+++ We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
c16067 +++$+++ Peggy Lee?
c06370 +++$+++ To save lives.
c25733 +++$+++ Bottom, left, right. I have it.
c09792 +++$+++ Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
c22971 +++$+++ Think she means for us to follow?
c04324 +++$+++ Do you?
c24780 +++$+++ Guess you missed it.
c08933 +++$+++ ... A cloaking device?
c15213 +++$+++ You are too crude.
c04354 +++$+++ Now, when did you adopt me?
c16319 +++$+++ You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
c11233 +++$+++ What the fuck are you doing here?
c08779 +++$+++ I don't know.  It wouldn't be very smart.
c21642 +++$+++ Right.
c26060 +++$+++ Look, Tommy, we know you're getting a hard time off Lizzy, but there's no need to take it out on us.
c05683 +++$+++ My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
c14424 +++$+++ She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
c12531 +++$+++ Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
c11988 +++$+++ You can make a mistake.
c17592 +++$+++ Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
c09798 +++$+++ I am impatient with stupidity. My people have learned to live without it.
c15340 +++$+++ Yeah, she's really somethin'.
c23899 +++$+++ It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
c24992 +++$+++ You think so?
c15111 +++$+++ Just someone from New Hampshire!
c22584 +++$+++ What's more important than sanitation?
c04532 +++$+++ I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
c15479 +++$+++ Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
c05582 +++$+++ A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
c05730 +++$+++ Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
c25126 +++$+++ What do you care?
c27415 +++$+++ One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
c03903 +++$+++ Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
c22882 +++$+++ It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
c01200 +++$+++ I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
c03377 +++$+++ You talked to Gozer?
c09463 +++$+++ When will I see you again?
c18728 +++$+++ You know? How do you know?
c14459 +++$+++ I'm going to leave now. Do you want a lift?
c11869 +++$+++ And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
c01046 +++$+++ Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
c19004 +++$+++ Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
c07814 +++$+++ I don't want you to--
c24093 +++$+++ What did you do?
c21722 +++$+++ Sit... and spin.
c22877 +++$+++ You getting scared?
c14513 +++$+++ I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
c03796 +++$+++ Do you have any particular choice of girl?
c24594 +++$+++ And winter?
c08700 +++$+++ Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
c08680 +++$+++ I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
c08706 +++$+++ I wouldn't go that far.
c14720 +++$+++ I didn't forget.
c17422 +++$+++ No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
c12369 +++$+++ You married?
c01288 +++$+++ Really.
c17718 +++$+++ Yeah.
c24354 +++$+++ Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
c08947 +++$+++ The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
c07403 +++$+++ Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
c13966 +++$+++ Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
c01084 +++$+++ No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
c11001 +++$+++ I can't lean on Faust any harder -- he's been working non-stop on the engines.
c19684 +++$+++ I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
c27362 +++$+++ When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
c12913 +++$+++ How do you know?
c08769 +++$+++ Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
c03644 +++$+++ You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
c27157 +++$+++ I just want my life back...
c01225 +++$+++ The coward!
c09547 +++$+++ What about Thomas Ripley?
c08826 +++$+++ Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
c14920 +++$+++ Nuwanda, what is going on?
c14059 +++$+++ What smells like shoe polish?
c03550 +++$+++ Be quiet.
c15514 +++$+++ If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
c11309 +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
c16209 +++$+++ My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
c19633 +++$+++ I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
c06796 +++$+++ I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
c10724 +++$+++ I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
c14187 +++$+++ ... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
c23127 +++$+++ -- to be put in that kind of position...
c03821 +++$+++ What makes you so sure?
c15114 +++$+++ The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
c23384 +++$+++ You have any biscuits for sale?
c20905 +++$+++ Thanks. And what are -
c21336 +++$+++ Then wh-where do we land?
c03737 +++$+++ Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
c17553 +++$+++ It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
c11186 +++$+++ Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
c07334 +++$+++ I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
c07796 +++$+++ I'd rather read, thank-you.
c02201 +++$+++ Your basic hodge-podge.
c22545 +++$+++ Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
c27413 +++$+++ I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
c12089 +++$+++ I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
c18089 +++$+++ Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
c26281 +++$+++ I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
c26139 +++$+++ So, it was your first time.
c10107 +++$+++ Jeez, Mary... I'm...
c23553 +++$+++ What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
c01110 +++$+++ Then who wrote the report?
c08801 +++$+++ You should'a brought the girl.
c16384 +++$+++ You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
c17286 +++$+++ I known Kip longing than you, man ...
c14726 +++$+++ But...
c13284 +++$+++ What do you want?  Encouragement?  'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
c08808 +++$+++ I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
c10001 +++$+++ Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
c18064 +++$+++ You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
c05739 +++$+++ I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
c21347 +++$+++ Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
c07485 +++$+++ You're speaking up for him again?
c23342 +++$+++ I figured if you were gonna, then I wouldn't have to.
c25428 +++$+++ The piano.
c08979 +++$+++ Visual!  Mr. Sulu, divert everything to the phasers --
c05012 +++$+++ What do you want from me?
c09803 +++$+++ Is that what you're thinking about?
c01647 +++$+++ Yes. I do.
c14201 +++$+++ Carry on, Chief.
c22648 +++$+++ The Mexicali Boys
c21358 +++$+++ You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
c06285 +++$+++ It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
c17816 +++$+++ I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
c19599 +++$+++ THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
c05843 +++$+++ YOU'RE SORRY!!
c24518 +++$+++ Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
c10341 +++$+++ I am going over here.
c26026 +++$+++ Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
c01070 +++$+++ My Debbie?
c16523 +++$+++ That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
c14684 +++$+++ Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
c07288 +++$+++ Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
c15634 +++$+++ The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
c18190 +++$+++ -- I'm coming --
c10440 +++$+++ ...I understand...
c04427 +++$+++ Why?
c24373 +++$+++ They don't?  Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  Because they want to see me, me, me!  Norma Desmond.
c08960 +++$+++ All right, let's get on the Comm-pic to Doctor Marcus. Maybe it's something we can transplant.
c09038 +++$+++ Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
c12413 +++$+++ You think she sure 'nough your sister?
c21787 +++$+++ No, I'm sorry, I don't.
c17619 +++$+++ Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
c21056 +++$+++ It doesn't help him.
c16865 +++$+++ I would rather march.
c03907 +++$+++ You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
c15845 +++$+++ You won't.
c12274 +++$+++ That's good. I like to watch, too.
c03670 +++$+++ Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
c27181 +++$+++ You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
c18340 +++$+++ Yeah.
c03968 +++$+++ I'll be scarred for life.
c08702 +++$+++ -- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
c24121 +++$+++ You heard me: leave the table!
c02165 +++$+++ The new star. What are you gonna name it?
c03488 +++$+++ Not particularly.
c01779 +++$+++ Oh, yeah.
c00471 +++$+++ You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
c19425 +++$+++ Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
c02231 +++$+++ He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
c00876 +++$+++ The earth just opens up and swallows people.
c25800 +++$+++ Is this your gun?
c04015 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c16275 +++$+++ Yah.
c17039 +++$+++ Did they catch...?
c12159 +++$+++ It doesn't protect your head, though.
c05570 +++$+++ I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
c18819 +++$+++ Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
c18316 +++$+++ Why did you come in here?
c14941 +++$+++ I don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  Is that clear?  Is that clear!
c11015 +++$+++ Is it still moving?
c15398 +++$+++ She's in the kitchen. I'd yell for her, but I'd die.  You had a busy night last night.
c22906 +++$+++ The why'd the police let him go?
c09365 +++$+++ No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
c04770 +++$+++ I found it on the seat.
c20504 +++$+++ Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
c07532 +++$+++ And for cleaning up oil spills.
c20510 +++$+++ Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
c25285 +++$+++ I'm sure I'll find a way.
c26333 +++$+++ I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
c26770 +++$+++ What about them?
c07270 +++$+++ And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
c18977 +++$+++ That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
c04174 +++$+++ I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
c04496 +++$+++ That was seven hundred years ago.
c19481 +++$+++ Kay.
c26105 +++$+++ You wouldn't dare.
c02377 +++$+++ Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
c21690 +++$+++ You never were...
c26124 +++$+++ Harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
c06258 +++$+++ You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
c11909 +++$+++ Why?
c19210 +++$+++ I got the money to pay for 'em.
c01461 +++$+++ Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
c05526 +++$+++ You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
c00107 +++$+++ He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
c25572 +++$+++ He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
c00224 +++$+++ I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
c12727 +++$+++ I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
c27093 +++$+++ I guess.
c10116 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c23969 +++$+++ But why the dalmation?
c25141 +++$+++ German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
c16809 +++$+++ We must abandon.
c18011 +++$+++ I learned my fill from Romeriz.
c00409 +++$+++ No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd given me half a damned excuse -- I was pretty fucked up, you know.
c08213 +++$+++ Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
c26168 +++$+++ Would you like to get some pie?
c11734 +++$+++ No.
c25272 +++$+++ Aren't you curious to know about Friedman?
c06788 +++$+++ Ah, yes -- proceed.
c22540 +++$+++ Why not?
c25710 +++$+++ Make it out to cash!
c18372 +++$+++ It's freezing.
c09712 +++$+++ Santa Rosa?
c19641 +++$+++ Come now, Athos, if Porthos is determined to end his life, then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity.
c25324 +++$+++ Yeah. Why? You're going to look for her... Shit! You really think his pictures are that good?
c22642 +++$+++ Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
c16841 +++$+++ Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
c12784 +++$+++ Why?
c21531 +++$+++ If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
c09785 +++$+++ Where is that?
c21707 +++$+++ I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
c24899 +++$+++ Huh.
c23060 +++$+++ How much?
c12043 +++$+++ What's your fuckin' problem? You get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
c14656 +++$+++ No.
c18800 +++$+++ How do you mean?
c07639 +++$+++ But it could happen.
c16894 +++$+++ She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
c20765 +++$+++ Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
c26768 +++$+++ Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
c09482 +++$+++ Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
c25063 +++$+++ Already there.
c17142 +++$+++ Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
c13738 +++$+++ I know.  I'm sorry.
c14960 +++$+++ Then who are you?
c24678 +++$+++ That's great!  See, you're getting it.
c12403 +++$+++ Aye. Speak then if ye must.
c16019 +++$+++ Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
c07626 +++$+++ And they won't be able to tell?
c23494 +++$+++ Nice try. You had me going for a second, but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that.  Would he?
c18715 +++$+++ I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
c25885 +++$+++ Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet.
c08869 +++$+++ Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
c00047 +++$+++ You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
c27295 +++$+++ Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
c21254 +++$+++ I have to qualify, is that it?
c24535 +++$+++ Jealous? Of what?
c10805 +++$+++ Do we just leave him there?
c17631 +++$+++ Saving the treats for Bob?
c08989 +++$+++ Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
c07312 +++$+++ You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
c19768 +++$+++ I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
c22390 +++$+++ Good at what?
c15782 +++$+++ You're a lawyer?
c15174 +++$+++ Bullshit!
c02604 +++$+++ Put your tiny little mind at ease.
c18952 +++$+++ Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
c18387 +++$+++ What I saw?
c00463 +++$+++ What is it, Mary?
c25191 +++$+++ For others, yes... For you, who knows?
c01774 +++$+++ Do you have your own cell?
c05692 +++$+++ Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places.
c00454 +++$+++ How do you know she understands? You haven't spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
c04968 +++$+++ What does she think she's gettin?
c14973 +++$+++ What the hell does that mean?
c14093 +++$+++ Thirty-seven.
c20272 +++$+++ Why you talking to me?
c22183 +++$+++ ...The guy's great.
c15836 +++$+++ I am not talking to you, bitch.
c02726 +++$+++ Huh?
c07249 +++$+++ You said in L.A., anything goes.
c25830 +++$+++ I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
c16623 +++$+++ What?
c15858 +++$+++ To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
c16318 +++$+++ Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
c26018 +++$+++ I'll get there as soon as I can.
c02127 +++$+++ Did you solve your problems?
c25039 +++$+++ Been where?
c22839 +++$+++ I figured I'd be safe If I was at least up here with the people I care about.  Now where's this Kincaid guy the news is talking about? I found this place from a FOX 5 TV NEWS REPORT. Heh.
c21044 +++$+++ Yeah, kid?
c22601 +++$+++ It's possible. Just negotiate.
c20825 +++$+++ You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
c21260 +++$+++ Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
c11488 +++$+++ Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
c22196 +++$+++ Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
c21408 +++$+++ Am I dead or not?
c24634 +++$+++ That's right!  Tell him, so I can read it in Hunsecker's column first!
c08735 +++$+++ Why?
c03823 +++$+++ Where is he?
c02190 +++$+++ What else can we do?
c14161 +++$+++ Where's the rest of the team?
c06118 +++$+++ Yes. Did you eat?
c19631 +++$+++ This happens....this is something that happens.
c06573 +++$+++ My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
c06569 +++$+++ A camp! Well!
c00591 +++$+++ So you are! The place is a pigsty all the time.
c08474 +++$+++ It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
c20066 +++$+++ As in, your ass is dead in the water.
c12701 +++$+++ Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
c05723 +++$+++ Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
c00478 +++$+++ Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
c15418 +++$+++ So he killed himself.
c26271 +++$+++ But he's dead.
c23850 +++$+++ You want to kill him?
c10481 +++$+++ And I...I've got other things happening.
c21555 +++$+++ Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
c04028 +++$+++ So you weren't interested in music at all?
c23065 +++$+++ They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
c23254 +++$+++ Good evening, Mr. Halloran.  What can I do for you?
c05492 +++$+++ So everything you just said --
c06903 +++$+++ You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
c25745 +++$+++ You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
c22170 +++$+++ Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
c20083 +++$+++ But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
c20988 +++$+++ Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
c22408 +++$+++ You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
c21447 +++$+++ Really?
c03516 +++$+++ I will.
c25050 +++$+++ Where is he?
c22843 +++$+++ Has anyone else every used your phone?
c18074 +++$+++ What hospital?
c21834 +++$+++ Then make your choice.
c08756 +++$+++ Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
c11993 +++$+++ Why take the risk?
c10459 +++$+++ We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
c09753 +++$+++ Where are they? Last chance.
c00215 +++$+++ But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
c25831 +++$+++ Yeah, you look it.
c15841 +++$+++ Yes, My Lord.
c09639 +++$+++ You can't testify.
c21098 +++$+++ Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
c02593 +++$+++ Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
c13766 +++$+++ WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
c13962 +++$+++ No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
c13659 +++$+++ Should blow you away, you know that?
c14181 +++$+++ What crime did you commit.
c06543 +++$+++ For one week!
c08209 +++$+++ You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing...
c17116 +++$+++ That's how it was in the old world, Pop, but this is not Sicily.
c26637 +++$+++ Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
c05393 +++$+++ He will not!
c07783 +++$+++ Yes?
c17800 +++$+++ I'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
c13442 +++$+++ Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
c05592 +++$+++ Oh.
c20771 +++$+++ It sure is.
c05747 +++$+++ You have a dog? What kind?
c20908 +++$+++ Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
c19149 +++$+++ Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
c04573 +++$+++ I will?
c16930 +++$+++ I'll bet you can.
c12914 +++$+++ And you believe her?
c26804 +++$+++ Izzat the thing...
c03888 +++$+++ To whom?
c06148 +++$+++ Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
c20885 +++$+++ You're Pam?
c00739 +++$+++ You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn--
c05788 +++$+++ My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
c12315 +++$+++ Sid, it's useless!
c04164 +++$+++ Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
c16078 +++$+++ Thanks.
c21302 +++$+++ I can tell.
c02548 +++$+++ Why? Why do you have to go?
c20744 +++$+++ They've killed a shitload of inmates and guards---
c03249 +++$+++ Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
c19033 +++$+++ We bring greetings from Chairman Mao.
c25323 +++$+++ I'd appreciate it if I could use your phone.
c14795 +++$+++ Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
c22143 +++$+++ You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
c11535 +++$+++ I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
c15088 +++$+++ The only one you missed -- is the President.
c06488 +++$+++ <i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
c14635 +++$+++ I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
c11041 +++$+++ Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
c26275 +++$+++ Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
c18521 +++$+++ And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
c07044 +++$+++ Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon all of them.  Nobody's going to investigate a crime for which the criminals have already been pardoned.
c02128 +++$+++ Ross.
c20588 +++$+++ You're such a baby.
c17578 +++$+++ You what?
c08355 +++$+++ Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
c13603 +++$+++ Fuck off back to Essex!
c17883 +++$+++ I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
c18811 +++$+++ So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
c20291 +++$+++ I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
c21523 +++$+++ Any particular reason?
c04171 +++$+++ We're not interested.
c20306 +++$+++ I will. But I must find the right moment.
c18219 +++$+++ Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
c12651 +++$+++ Yes. I do.
c13366 +++$+++ I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
c01113 +++$+++ Four months?
c05659 +++$+++ Then you tell me, what just happened?
c18961 +++$+++ They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
c12684 +++$+++ I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
c15505 +++$+++ Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
c24909 +++$+++ How's that?
c20628 +++$+++ He won't give it to me.
c10343 +++$+++ Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
c18095 +++$+++ Special Agent Jones.
c08267 +++$+++ But she was here?
c18164 +++$+++ And how the hell are we going to do that?
c02161 +++$+++ I have no proof that it was false data.
c11607 +++$+++ But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
c16933 +++$+++ No more about Beynon.
c02786 +++$+++ What's that?
c22273 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c19003 +++$+++ I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
c16752 +++$+++ In that little thing?
c14969 +++$+++ I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
c03448 +++$+++ Yes I am.
c08969 +++$+++ I've never even met Admiral Kirk --
c03989 +++$+++ What do we do if there isn't?
c19327 +++$+++ Hell of a spot to put a business.
c24704 +++$+++ You do shorthand and typing?
c15131 +++$+++ No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
c08236 +++$+++ The people at the restaurant?
c12442 +++$+++ Your phone's ringing, Dude.
c09546 +++$+++ Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
c20968 +++$+++ No.
c01625 +++$+++ Hello, daddy.
c07623 +++$+++ Yes.
c02255 +++$+++ What happened?
c12230 +++$+++ We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
c18022 +++$+++ Why are you doing this?
c14805 +++$+++ Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
c13125 +++$+++ Who with?
c03665 +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me?
c00108 +++$+++ I don't even watch TV.
c13049 +++$+++ Bastard!!!
c26197 +++$+++ Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
c03598 +++$+++ Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
c24214 +++$+++ They can't touch us at this height.
c22557 +++$+++ It doesn't.  They ask you.
c17682 +++$+++ W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
c17784 +++$+++ Give it up.
c03677 +++$+++ Can't you hold it?
c11066 +++$+++ I just asked a simple question.
c00679 +++$+++ No.
c20775 +++$+++ Don't call my men assholes.
c23666 +++$+++ What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
c19394 +++$+++ Where'd you grow up?
c01923 +++$+++ Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
c09405 +++$+++ ...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
c17200 +++$+++ It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
c25152 +++$+++ Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
c00445 +++$+++ Nine.
c03333 +++$+++ I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
c15458 +++$+++ Look, we gotta talk.
c27360 +++$+++ I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
c16430 +++$+++ ... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
c27344 +++$+++ So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
c25612 +++$+++ What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
c10790 +++$+++ What's your fucking problem?
c27221 +++$+++ You'd lie to protect him.
c25259 +++$+++ You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
c25066 +++$+++ That's a secret.
c26832 +++$+++ Whaddaya think?
c02175 +++$+++ Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
c01831 +++$+++ So let the council swear publicly.
c09473 +++$+++ I'm not asking you for help, Mike. Just take off the handcuffs.
c07565 +++$+++ Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I--
c00716 +++$+++ That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
c01700 +++$+++ He's a nigger.
c09862 +++$+++ After all this mess then.
c07743 +++$+++ Please don't do this.
c25232 +++$+++ Mmm------yes.
c09625 +++$+++ Albert Lucas Trumbo.  But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
c07067 +++$+++ How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
c13875 +++$+++ What for?
c21779 +++$+++ And who is that?
c20429 +++$+++ It's twelve-thirty!
c02956 +++$+++ Last time I didn't.
c10871 +++$+++ You don't like brussel sprouts?
c13110 +++$+++ No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
c18285 +++$+++ Well, I made the dean's list.
c23844 +++$+++ Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
c19335 +++$+++ That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
c02570 +++$+++ ...you okay?
c06380 +++$+++ Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
c03525 +++$+++ Of course.
c13645 +++$+++ As the man said, it's in my nature.
c04432 +++$+++ What's his family background?
c10195 +++$+++ It does.
c05110 +++$+++ Two cases. And dinner when you land.
c15697 +++$+++ I think that's called looting.
c03581 +++$+++ Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --
c17559 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c00281 +++$+++ You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
c07737 +++$+++ Yeah.....you got here early huh?
c16939 +++$+++ Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
c09895 +++$+++ I mean... well... affection.
c14905 +++$+++ Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
c06432 +++$+++ The goddamned bastards.
c18754 +++$+++ Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
c10229 +++$+++ Yes sir.
c14477 +++$+++ Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
c06063 +++$+++ Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
c18542 +++$+++ Shut up.
c16757 +++$+++ My ass.
c04263 +++$+++ Well, technically I did what ya said.
c03137 +++$+++ Hm?
c05443 +++$+++ Red flag, man.
c21537 +++$+++ I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
c14507 +++$+++ Yeah.
c16806 +++$+++ Crosstown.
c09143 +++$+++ That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
c17865 +++$+++ What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
c19086 +++$+++ I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
c10442 +++$+++ He's not in, Sir.
c10670 +++$+++ Can I ask you something about her?
c06779 +++$+++ So you're chicken?
c19234 +++$+++ Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking course.
c25244 +++$+++ I don't know.
c04954 +++$+++ Uh-uh.
c15060 +++$+++ Belle --
c22137 +++$+++ ...Are you going to say anything to him?
c08022 +++$+++ Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
c10856 +++$+++ Where do you meet?
c02371 +++$+++ Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
c12239 +++$+++ Just one daughter.
c04815 +++$+++ You mean about the Andrews' kid?
c01761 +++$+++ What's your fucking problem? You're a shithead!
c19176 +++$+++ C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
c16708 +++$+++ Daddy, I'm scared.
c17018 +++$+++ You haven't talked to him.
c17964 +++$+++ A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
c22785 +++$+++ Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
c24670 +++$+++ I made you write a beautiful song...
c00501 +++$+++ Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
c25178 +++$+++ He seems to have won it.
c22797 +++$+++ And now, drum roll please...
c25926 +++$+++ You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
c10130 +++$+++ What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
c14068 +++$+++ It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
c03706 +++$+++ I dunno.
c08090 +++$+++ Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
c08266 +++$+++ I don't believe it.
c17044 +++$+++ Moss...Who told him?
c14637 +++$+++ What?
c02927 +++$+++ I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
c26052 +++$+++ Why would I want to sell my passport?
c15463 +++$+++ What...
c10948 +++$+++ Clean though, isn't he?
c03110 +++$+++ I had to tell 'em something.
c22970 +++$+++ Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
c17101 +++$+++ They got, listen to me...
c09518 +++$+++ Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
c19344 +++$+++ Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him.
c20927 +++$+++ I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
c26465 +++$+++ You... you ain't gonna shoot him yourownself?
c20777 +++$+++ No thanks.
c06997 +++$+++ Oh, let it ring.
c18846 +++$+++ What?  What can we do?
c24024 +++$+++ I know that...
c19567 +++$+++ Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
c07441 +++$+++ You know how old I am.
c08810 +++$+++ Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
c25265 +++$+++ Perhaps I should come back when you're...
c10839 +++$+++ And why wouldn't we have one like this?
c17799 +++$+++ I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
c18610 +++$+++ So?
c00413 +++$+++ How?
c05651 +++$+++ Which?
c00913 +++$+++ That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
c16702 +++$+++ I know.  He loves that thing.
c12718 +++$+++ Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
c03089 +++$+++ Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
c26894 +++$+++ Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
c25862 +++$+++ It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
c24788 +++$+++ Really?
c05064 +++$+++ Goddamn you!
c16360 +++$+++ My suitcase was vibrating?
c17609 +++$+++ Outside.
c18667 +++$+++ There's nothing to be sorry about.
c15461 +++$+++ Who's Shari?
c13540 +++$+++ And what're you whispering for?
c09032 +++$+++ I'll have to re-energize.
c11134 +++$+++ --a spy, you mean?
c03680 +++$+++ No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
c24459 +++$+++ The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
c14977 +++$+++ Damn right!
c01543 +++$+++ Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
c26926 +++$+++ Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
c09976 +++$+++ It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
c21246 +++$+++ Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
c12636 +++$+++ Sometimes I think I do.
c23805 +++$+++ I said back away.
c02928 +++$+++ Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
c12848 +++$+++ No. We're going to lock this up and --
c05488 +++$+++ So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
c24855 +++$+++ No one else is even here yet.
c14880 +++$+++ Mind if I sit down?
c09346 +++$+++ You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
c09488 +++$+++ The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating.  Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
c06808 +++$+++ But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
c03106 +++$+++ "Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
c09650 +++$+++ Would that be Miss Sinclair?
c19903 +++$+++ But I didn't mean to do it!
c13279 +++$+++ And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
c22389 +++$+++ Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
c09766 +++$+++ Guy dressed for Halloween?
c07635 +++$+++ To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
c11230 +++$+++ Ready for what?
c13643 +++$+++ Will I see you again?
c01776 +++$+++ I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
c08076 +++$+++ Do what?
c26816 +++$+++ ...you want us to go to War with Albania.
c18336 +++$+++ Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
c16480 +++$+++ God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
c08077 +++$+++ That was my king!
c17680 +++$+++ He's got like six gold records.
c23801 +++$+++ You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
c09360 +++$+++ Are you calling Her?
c16182 +++$+++ Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Why'd we ever leave?
c21876 +++$+++ I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
c17064 +++$+++ Mmm.
c14515 +++$+++ It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
c12752 +++$+++ No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
c27147 +++$+++ Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me.  Right?  And Sam.  Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it.  Stay strong and he can't do shit.
c25195 +++$+++ It's okay.
c10648 +++$+++ It's just ail that crap he spins out. Just once I'd like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
c14011 +++$+++ Mr. Kane, how can I persuade you -
c12140 +++$+++ The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
c13913 +++$+++ My husband.
c07973 +++$+++ No.  It's perpetual motion.
c16748 +++$+++ Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
c09053 +++$+++ From the mission...
c16447 +++$+++ We just take pictures?
c26721 +++$+++ I love you.
c19236 +++$+++ How the fuck should I know?
c18341 +++$+++ You should probably get dressed. The boys will be home soon.
c18700 +++$+++ I remember the old bastard's liver! I don't believe you did that. I had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
c25297 +++$+++ Well, I hope you're not too heartbroken and...
c03734 +++$+++ They don't have to feel like slaves.
c10010 +++$+++ Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might be crazy.
c02454 +++$+++ For your own sake... For the others... I...
c06932 +++$+++ Only she won't never let me play with it.
c12344 +++$+++ Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
c01539 +++$+++ ...I do.
c06635 +++$+++ I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
c15386 +++$+++ The sun.
c21301 +++$+++ I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
c14247 +++$+++ I don't understand...
c25344 +++$+++ I want to stay with you...
c00522 +++$+++ Did you talk to him?
c00753 +++$+++ How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
c06992 +++$+++ Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
c26620 +++$+++ They're none of them right.
c03830 +++$+++ But this is my apartment.
c13790 +++$+++ You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
c11090 +++$+++ I don't intend to be.
c21486 +++$+++ I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
c15432 +++$+++ Our what?
c13479 +++$+++ No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
c07060 +++$+++ Can we get around this, Al?
c14716 +++$+++ It's your play.
c06602 +++$+++ Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
c14837 +++$+++ Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
c15476 +++$+++ It happens, Larry. People make mistakes.
c15343 +++$+++ I don't understand.
c05247 +++$+++ At the block party?
c09478 +++$+++ I'll come down.
c13929 +++$+++ Do? To who?
c12576 +++$+++ She's far from "fine."
c12655 +++$+++ That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
c03653 +++$+++ I can be real stiff.
c09535 +++$+++ We'll be there.
c18325 +++$+++ Right o'.
c22116 +++$+++ And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
c21335 +++$+++ Well...sure.
c19676 +++$+++ But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
c10738 +++$+++ Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
c05468 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c09102 +++$+++ This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
c01852 +++$+++ York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
c01685 +++$+++ Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
c02502 +++$+++ I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
c04822 +++$+++ Zeke.  Git!
c23004 +++$+++ Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
c13318 +++$+++ Aren't we all?
c06856 +++$+++ What it smell like?
c12695 +++$+++ Because they caught me?
c02311 +++$+++ Yah?
c01404 +++$+++ Means ya healin'.  So all this farmin' make me think on Matthew. Matthew 13. The parable of the sower? Man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
c12212 +++$+++ Uh, we didn't score yet.
c08816 +++$+++ Can I get a word in edgewise?
c06823 +++$+++ Five minutes.
c00891 +++$+++ No, man. I'm gonna bail.
c08889 +++$+++ Population?
c05569 +++$+++ The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
c05035 +++$+++ It's not healthy with it closed.
c00859 +++$+++ Jean? What?
c21168 +++$+++ Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
c07408 +++$+++ No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
c21665 +++$+++ One or two.  A grey lot.  Some social democrats.  Some diligent anti-communists.  A political section man from the US Embassy. And this exquisite Californian wine, courtesy of the CIA.
c03513 +++$+++ What?
c25920 +++$+++ Stay until you feel better? I would like to hear all the news.
c22539 +++$+++ Have you had any relationship since?
c22609 +++$+++ First rate, ain't it?
c09178 +++$+++ You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
c21426 +++$+++ I'm not going to close the--
c09732 +++$+++ Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
c25867 +++$+++ I wonder if it runs in the family.
c10373 +++$+++ James...
c15448 +++$+++ I'm making a tape.
c09304 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c02304 +++$+++ Where is she?!
c09642 +++$+++ It's wrong, Leo.
c26897 +++$+++ The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
c04000 +++$+++ We can take your car.
c00641 +++$+++ Yes.
c21118 +++$+++ You don't have any idea?
c15511 +++$+++ That obvious, huh?
c19734 +++$+++ We have it good, don't we?
c12764 +++$+++ It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
c02089 +++$+++ Sorry. What?
c21559 +++$+++ Vancouver, B.C.
c03835 +++$+++ God, I don't know what it was called. I never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned thing.
c08949 +++$+++ You're not going in there -- !
c13050 +++$+++ Jack ...
c01808 +++$+++ But it ends up the same.
c04230 +++$+++ With Mrs. Evans. I hate her.
c00110 +++$+++ Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
c20163 +++$+++ You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
c00871 +++$+++ No, really. I'm okay.
c20356 +++$+++ I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
c04205 +++$+++ Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
c25133 +++$+++ Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
c23816 +++$+++ He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.
c21816 +++$+++ Double it. My Princess must be safe.
c09562 +++$+++ Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
c17797 +++$+++ I realize, you're under a lot of....
c19861 +++$+++ Charlie...?
c24365 +++$+++ Don't get sore at me.  I'm not an executive.  I'm just a writer.
c16754 +++$+++ You admit the sign did say "Camp Forest Green," with an arrow pointing this way.
c24284 +++$+++ You did, huh? Good for you.
c19049 +++$+++ Pretend.
c04685 +++$+++ You just haven't met the right person.
c04816 +++$+++ Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
c06358 +++$+++ And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
c12162 +++$+++ What did you see?
c21664 +++$+++ In your car
c25794 +++$+++ Yes--Me--in person!
c17841 +++$+++ Iunno.  Of course I believe you.

c17020 +++$+++ Well.  Well...
c07909 +++$+++ So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
c21384 +++$+++ Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
c09209 +++$+++ I want to try it.
c02892 +++$+++ Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
c23966 +++$+++ What's it called?
c04837 +++$+++ So why does he call himself Bertrand?
c24348 +++$+++ You sure have.
c09516 +++$+++ He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
c08466 +++$+++ It's getting stronger.
c08345 +++$+++ Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
c17868 +++$+++ Answer him dick!
c18594 +++$+++ Not enough loving.
c07068 +++$+++ Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
c17271 +++$+++ Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
c19758 +++$+++ So I understand you're from Lithuania?
c25477 +++$+++ And you expect me to come over, just like that.
c04331 +++$+++ Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
c08248 +++$+++ He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
c16932 +++$+++ We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
c24645 +++$+++ Yeah.  At Bellevue.  Still hanging on.  But they still don't know if she was pushed.
c07578 +++$+++ I'll bite. What's the catch?
c00038 +++$+++ You -- covered in my vomit.
c02280 +++$+++ Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
c17723 +++$+++ With a, with a stranger?  With a--
c02893 +++$+++ Not even for lunch?
c19017 +++$+++ Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
c10863 +++$+++ From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
c16468 +++$+++ No.
c03091 +++$+++ What three hundred grand?
c17031 +++$+++ I do?
c07483 +++$+++ Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
c17447 +++$+++ Please don't.
c09091 +++$+++ I've enhanced the plasma injectors -- don't worry, they'll see it.
c11491 +++$+++ I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
c26506 +++$+++ I hear you did time with old Spook. Yeah, he was a good egg. I used to run a lot of dope for him. Fuckin' shame he got shivved.
c21528 +++$+++ Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
c02541 +++$+++ Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
c19583 +++$+++ Alright.  Thank you.
c04545 +++$+++ Swim.
c12790 +++$+++ Why does she come to you?
c12611 +++$+++ Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. goddam!!! This is the suavest guy I know. look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. this beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. it makes me puke.
c19652 +++$+++ It is already done.  I have just stopped at Mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.
c08158 +++$+++ Then I know my alphabet.
c11903 +++$+++ How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
c01880 +++$+++ Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
c00392 +++$+++ I figured you already heard.
c18322 +++$+++ I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
c22451 +++$+++ Yes.
c17202 +++$+++ No.  The girl.
c27298 +++$+++ I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
c07265 +++$+++ Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
c25732 +++$+++ You're certain?
c01890 +++$+++ The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
c21819 +++$+++ -- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
c18838 +++$+++ Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
c09522 +++$+++ It's all true.
c17595 +++$+++ Don't get angry.
c02733 +++$+++ You know that no one likes a liar, right?
c26279 +++$+++ Please, just leave the car alone.
c00367 +++$+++ He musta found out. They had to get rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.
c21328 +++$+++ What's there?
c05113 +++$+++ It's his birthday present, and you closed the beach, Honey. I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday. I don't believe he'll ever do it again.
c17748 +++$+++ Oh, who cares?
c11338 +++$+++ You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
c22599 +++$+++ Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, "Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans."
c23195 +++$+++ How?
c22151 +++$+++ The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
c22406 +++$+++ They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
c21345 +++$+++ How did you?...
c12720 +++$+++ Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
c09743 +++$+++ It wouldn't be half so much fun for me. Toddy, as to have you come here and beg --
c25057 +++$+++ Like a New Year's Day hangover.
c07821 +++$+++ But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
c12405 +++$+++ If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
c15722 +++$+++ He can't even move.
c18409 +++$+++ Lestat! You knew Lestat!
c23832 +++$+++ That's quite a secret.
c11990 +++$+++ My wife used to call me that.
c03059 +++$+++ It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
c12649 +++$+++ Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
c26086 +++$+++ This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
c16913 +++$+++ You okay?
c15884 +++$+++ I'll die first.
c14853 +++$+++ Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
c04243 +++$+++ Oh, that.
c21418 +++$+++ Wait! I'll go with you!
c12116 +++$+++ It'll never work.
c20893 +++$+++ Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
c22721 +++$+++ So it's an honor?
c22022 +++$+++ And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
c19075 +++$+++ Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
c23405 +++$+++ I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
c05876 +++$+++ You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago--  --you're still alive, Father Perrault!
c02655 +++$+++ How often do you go?
c24381 +++$+++ I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
c22091 +++$+++ That's not true.
c21617 +++$+++ They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
c24409 +++$+++ I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
c17224 +++$+++ Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
c01071 +++$+++ You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
c06496 +++$+++ OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
c07371 +++$+++ Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
c11197 +++$+++ I wasn't making fun of you.
c15255 +++$+++ Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
c13046 +++$+++ Trust me.
c11537 +++$+++ It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
c02195 +++$+++ Who is...
c00455 +++$+++ But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
c09339 +++$+++ Koessler doesn't know any of this?
c22562 +++$+++ Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
c03647 +++$+++ Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have a car here.
c25416 +++$+++ Otherwise what?
c16789 +++$+++ I think I'll pass. See you later, okay?
c07187 +++$+++ You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
c18893 +++$+++ And you ...?
c17672 +++$+++ Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
c06595 +++$+++ Tell me more about yourself.
c06159 +++$+++ [Who's Tazinari?]
c11675 +++$+++ Is there another way to see it?
c14036 +++$+++ I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
c12440 +++$+++ I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!
c20638 +++$+++ I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
c09620 +++$+++ Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
c25568 +++$+++ I just wanted to tell you...
c07052 +++$+++ Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
c06529 +++$+++ Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
c08729 +++$+++ Who was it?
c17926 +++$+++ I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
c27077 +++$+++ Some of them have to be automatics.
c25672 +++$+++ Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
c13812 +++$+++ Yes.
c04600 +++$+++ What about the others.
c14651 +++$+++ Eww. No. That's gross.
c04193 +++$+++ He's on my phone. He just called me.
c16005 +++$+++ You got weird kids, Frank.
c19777 +++$+++ Then your father's a wimp.
c17486 +++$+++ I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
c01448 +++$+++ She's such a long way home for you.
c18488 +++$+++ Yeah, very funny.
c24377 +++$+++ Tails.  That's ridiculous.
c06001 +++$+++ Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
c18910 +++$+++ You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
c15271 +++$+++ I know I did.
c01138 +++$+++ I want 15 on the Mets.
c22138 +++$+++ Is everything all right?
c25748 +++$+++ That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
c26838 +++$+++ There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber,
c22603 +++$+++ But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
c23878 +++$+++ Her legs are in the way.
c17417 +++$+++ They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
c12460 +++$+++ Yeah, but what about--
c17362 +++$+++ Who is he?
c26995 +++$+++ That's not what I'm sayi--
c17752 +++$+++ Tch.
c16649 +++$+++ What?  Jesus, tell me!
c25391 +++$+++ Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
c20932 +++$+++ Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
c16747 +++$+++ You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
c23702 +++$+++ Oh.
c26076 +++$+++ MM.?
c24721 +++$+++ I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
c02407 +++$+++ Yes.
c23723 +++$+++ You want to go back to shuttle work?
c10170 +++$+++ I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
c23499 +++$+++ I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
c05153 +++$+++ You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
c24924 +++$+++ Jesus...
c26499 +++$+++ Well, I'm sorry.
c09985 +++$+++ Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
c11641 +++$+++ With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
c15573 +++$+++ Working whores with squad two.
c04551 +++$+++ Yeah. I did it.
c15799 +++$+++ I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
c02674 +++$+++ Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
c24328 +++$+++ It wasn't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they'd lived!  Oh G-d, I'm gonna be someone's bald bitch!
c05096 +++$+++ Well I mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
c12469 +++$+++ What the fuck are you--
c18202 +++$+++ No.
c13621 +++$+++ You mean that?
c00099 +++$+++ No!  Nothing happened.
c23184 +++$+++ Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
c05234 +++$+++ Yep.
c10322 +++$+++ Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
c24934 +++$+++ You'll go to the prison hospital.
c21281 +++$+++ It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
c08788 +++$+++ I'd identify him.
c24451 +++$+++ Who?
c20665 +++$+++ I just think you're wrong, is all.
c26068 +++$+++ But the shuttle-
c19654 +++$+++ I know.
c25633 +++$+++ Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
c22101 +++$+++ The same as always.
c14934 +++$+++ Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
c24113 +++$+++ You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
c14786 +++$+++ Frida, you know you're it for me.
c13076 +++$+++ What have you done with his body?
c27155 +++$+++ I love you.  Now give me the line.
c21088 +++$+++ You're sure...
c26462 +++$+++ Been gone near three years now.
c04992 +++$+++ You gonna tell me who it was?
c27300 +++$+++ No idea who's behind this?
c03295 +++$+++ We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
c02250 +++$+++ Look, you can have my wallet...
c20078 +++$+++ I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
c17499 +++$+++ Doesn't matter.
c08805 +++$+++ She's what?
c17667 +++$+++ You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
c10808 +++$+++ 1840... 50... 60... 70...
c04237 +++$+++ Who pays for them?
c06219 +++$+++ You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
c18039 +++$+++ It has to be.
c18654 +++$+++ Dad died from a heart attack....
c25017 +++$+++ I'm looking for him.
c26542 +++$+++ ...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
c21318 +++$+++ But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
c11342 +++$+++ Thanks, honey.
c13463 +++$+++ You're so nice.
c18211 +++$+++ Well what is it!
c26366 +++$+++ How much time?
c05129 +++$+++ Well... is everything all right?
c12347 +++$+++ What's that?
c15542 +++$+++ I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
c00200 +++$+++ I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
c04476 +++$+++ No. You like the way I do things.
c03721 +++$+++ No.
c11643 +++$+++ We've got another two hours of daylight.
c13129 +++$+++ I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
c14076 +++$+++ We're not playing in the street.
c26763 +++$+++ A black bull came.
c22235 +++$+++ Farewell, my cuz.
c22452 +++$+++ It's Griffin.
c00617 +++$+++ But I can't lose this post, I simply can't! Excellency, please. Let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the Emperor that Herr Sommer is an awful choice. He could actually do musical harm to the Princess!
c06888 +++$+++ Please...
c01786 +++$+++ It's locked.
c17918 +++$+++ But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
c10822 +++$+++ No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
c23572 +++$+++ This is where I get off.
c02626 +++$+++ I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
c19296 +++$+++ I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
c19105 +++$+++ Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
c10965 +++$+++ Do you remember the pyramid?
c02481 +++$+++ No. I --
c14336 +++$+++ Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
c23185 +++$+++ No, but I think they might.
c10065 +++$+++ Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
c03405 +++$+++ The battle is over.  The war is over.  You've won!
c22192 +++$+++ Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
c08957 +++$+++ Carol!
c21634 +++$+++ Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
c21889 +++$+++ Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
c20917 +++$+++ Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
c11124 +++$+++ I placed...?
c21157 +++$+++ Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for.  Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the-- er-- as you put it-- main order of business?
c21855 +++$+++ Maybe you're happy.
c22998 +++$+++ Partners!
c01059 +++$+++ She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
c25576 +++$+++ You don't know that.
c03251 +++$+++ Yeah, sure, I guess...
c15994 +++$+++ They're falling out.
c00475 +++$+++ No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
c23981 +++$+++ Fix my glasses.
c05161 +++$+++ What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
c21752 +++$+++ You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
c05847 +++$+++ Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
c19063 +++$+++ And what would he do come winter?
c14811 +++$+++ No, it was our first date.
c06002 +++$+++ Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
c03198 +++$+++ Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
c00915 +++$+++ 'Have a look?
c00906 +++$+++ Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
c14479 +++$+++ It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
c21084 +++$+++ Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
c11381 +++$+++ The camera loves her.  A great actress.
c19747 +++$+++ Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
c10423 +++$+++ My client can't walk, your Honor.
c24012 +++$+++ <u>Bobby</u>...
c11093 +++$+++ He can help you.
c07518 +++$+++ This is what my entire life has been directed at, this moment, this threshold.
c11640 +++$+++ Six months.  Ecological study for Northland Oil.
c25367 +++$+++ Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
c17509 +++$+++ Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
c00061 +++$+++ Kat a fan, too?
c19232 +++$+++ So?
c19434 +++$+++ Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
c01079 +++$+++ It works.
c14207 +++$+++ No?  How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
c07911 +++$+++ That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
c00352 +++$+++ My father!  He's not - ?
c13002 +++$+++ Listen to what you want.
c14817 +++$+++ I can tell she's not a killer. You just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
c22495 +++$+++ Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
c14026 +++$+++ Oh, yes, the bonus.
c13091 +++$+++ No underwear?
c14759 +++$+++ I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
c10197 +++$+++ You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
c10356 +++$+++ Maybe, later we could take a look.
c23013 +++$+++ This is a different one.
c13307 +++$+++ He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
c26346 +++$+++ Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
c24331 +++$+++ Definitely old.
c05691 +++$+++ I'm not gonna forget it. What does that mean? If you've got a plan, I think I have a right to know about it. I told you my plan.
c00605 +++$+++ You don't have secrets from me.
c22611 +++$+++ I ain't a idiot, asshole.
c16257 +++$+++ I did.
c06581 +++$+++ A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
c11411 +++$+++ You changed your mind.
c26791 +++$+++ She's beautiful, you know?
c26776 +++$+++ You know how much man power you're talking about?
c06399 +++$+++ What do you need?
c15733 +++$+++ You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
c06146 +++$+++ Might be all right.
c14889 +++$+++ It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
c05100 +++$+++ Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
c01692 +++$+++ It's ethics. I put evil men behind bars, but the law has miles of red tape and loopholes for these... cocksuckers to slip through. I've found out there are these two young men who fix the situation with an iron fist. As if they have God's permission. But what they do is wrong and I should arrest them... technically.
c13204 +++$+++ Then you should stay here.
c09001 +++$+++ ... It gives me a great sense of history.
c27340 +++$+++ Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
c10411 +++$+++ You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
c07752 +++$+++ It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
c07282 +++$+++ Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
c17974 +++$+++ Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
c20321 +++$+++ Not at all.  They could be carried.
c11514 +++$+++ I wouldn't say that --  What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
c23859 +++$+++ How's that?
c11591 +++$+++ Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
c18536 +++$+++ Is she running a temperature? What is it?
c06699 +++$+++ Maybe you'll catch it.
c08168 +++$+++ Sure. We can practice talking.
c25036 +++$+++ And you've never seen anything like that?
c03709 +++$+++ Blue soup.
c07256 +++$+++ I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
c06508 +++$+++ Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
c03590 +++$+++ I know -- I know.
c13032 +++$+++ You don't have to sing it.
c22887 +++$+++ Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
c11433 +++$+++ Oh my god.  I've been so rude.  I'm Skye Davidson.  Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
c02062 +++$+++ Like what?
c06850 +++$+++ I will.  When can I come visit?
c26514 +++$+++ You got him wrong.
c08705 +++$+++ ...Yeah, fifty-three.
c07307 +++$+++ That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
c25329 +++$+++ So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
c24754 +++$+++ Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
c17359 +++$+++ Why there?
c02602 +++$+++ Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
c02976 +++$+++ I can't.
c26745 +++$+++ What about them?
c02805 +++$+++ I don't care.
c00630 +++$+++ Also identical?
c06462 +++$+++ Okay. I'm listening.
c09135 +++$+++ You having hearing problems, mister?
c03964 +++$+++ Just a thought --
c13678 +++$+++ You won't run.
c11177 +++$+++ --absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
c19691 +++$+++ Tubbs, these people mean business.
c11357 +++$+++ Yes.
c11116 +++$+++ That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
c18885 +++$+++ When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
c05755 +++$+++ Nude. Imagine, a pair.
c14322 +++$+++ Actually I'm running late --
c03585 +++$+++ Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
c27009 +++$+++ I'm tired.  I need to rest.
c02874 +++$+++ What's this about, money?
c26053 +++$+++ So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
c00694 +++$+++ Beware the moon?
c11048 +++$+++ Of course I knew.
c23227 +++$+++ Johnny!
c23399 +++$+++ He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
c00339 +++$+++ About Freddy?
c03379 +++$+++ Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
c04080 +++$+++ It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
c00265 +++$+++ My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
c27151 +++$+++ Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
c06730 +++$+++ But look at me now...
c11243 +++$+++ No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
c14616 +++$+++ You cut her.  You raped her.  You watched!
c11688 +++$+++ Well...
c02084 +++$+++ I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
c26031 +++$+++ You're too young.
c02382 +++$+++ He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
c23061 +++$+++ There was a break-in.
c26276 +++$+++ Then you ain't gonna have the car.
c26907 +++$+++ I don't.
c04201 +++$+++ Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours?  Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
c01083 +++$+++ -- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
c22311 +++$+++ I probably would have.  I guess the clues damn near before everyone.
c24349 +++$+++ Check.
c03353 +++$+++ Goodbye.
c02661 +++$+++ He was hot, wasn't he?
c02187 +++$+++ I'll make it worth your while.
c14657 +++$+++ Well did you like it?
c25651 +++$+++ Oh, That!  I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
c22775 +++$+++ Would it do any good?
c18967 +++$+++ We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
c00592 +++$+++ I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
c11874 +++$+++ And where am I gonna be?
c16560 +++$+++ Your friend must be misinformed.
c06946 +++$+++ You do?
c04414 +++$+++ Shhh... don't talk.
c15740 +++$+++ Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
c12924 +++$+++ Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
c04139 +++$+++ The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
c06427 +++$+++ And I ain't no nigger either!
c19634 +++$+++ I am preparing for a ball!
c24534 +++$+++ There's no real proof that tobacco  --
c18133 +++$+++ Promoted. House Manager.
c07769 +++$+++ If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
c03794 +++$+++ What are you doing?
c03166 +++$+++ Her destination was Halifax, yeah.
c09168 +++$+++ You know I need to verify this.
c16099 +++$+++ Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
c19848 +++$+++ My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
c26397 +++$+++ Can you make it back up?
c01036 +++$+++ I love that car.
c02734 +++$+++ So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
c14436 +++$+++ How about I put Nikko on it?
c13215 +++$+++ Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
c19151 +++$+++ It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
c01639 +++$+++ Are you feeling okay?
c14942 +++$+++ Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
c08481 +++$+++ This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
c07320 +++$+++ The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
c24468 +++$+++ Uh...what channel were you watching?
c09494 +++$+++ Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...?
c02512 +++$+++ I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
c20255 +++$+++ Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
c06366 +++$+++ Around. Barnett's tough competition.
c09968 +++$+++ Becker does? Are you sure?
c15322 +++$+++ I never thought of that.
c19132 +++$+++ Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
c10649 +++$+++ First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
c27306 +++$+++ But you knew that I'd -- die.
c08096 +++$+++ Joe, trust me on this, you've made a mistake. He's a good kid. I understand you're hot, you're super-fuckin' pissed. We're all real emotional. But you're barking up the wrong tree. I know this man, and he wouldn't do that.
c22276 +++$+++ So what do we do?
c06156 +++$+++ Deal.
c03475 +++$+++ Why don't you get it.
c23567 +++$+++ - and you got to be girls.
c02004 +++$+++ Must have taken a hell of a long time.
c25932 +++$+++ I thought you weren't old fashioned.
c01840 +++$+++ We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
c24482 +++$+++ Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
c01226 +++$+++ Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
c21765 +++$+++ Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
c07598 +++$+++ Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
c21578 +++$+++ How bad is it?  Bad enough for--
c09707 +++$+++ It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
c18687 +++$+++ Manage the whole damn place some day. I'm looking forward to living in the style to which I would like to become accustomed....
c02949 +++$+++ I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
c11553 +++$+++ It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
c16707 +++$+++ Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
c07876 +++$+++ When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
c15256 +++$+++ I go to school where I live.
c16960 +++$+++ I've been asked to make sure you don't.
c09564 +++$+++ How long has he been there?
c19254 +++$+++ So?
c26081 +++$+++ Be one with the horse.
c01907 +++$+++ There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
c23219 +++$+++ See you later.
c20149 +++$+++ I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
c03471 +++$+++ I know that. But I'm --
c14044 +++$+++ And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
c24568 +++$+++ What happened?
c11901 +++$+++ Doing what?
c14743 +++$+++ If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
c10580 +++$+++ I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
c09739 +++$+++ You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
c12376 +++$+++ If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
c24295 +++$+++ Fuck you! You know, I'll call the police.
c02477 +++$+++ What?
c12113 +++$+++ Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
c11378 +++$+++ Why didn't you come in?
c06418 +++$+++ Not you.  A copy.
c10457 +++$+++ The 'History'...?
c21407 +++$+++ Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
c13770 +++$+++ You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
c21419 +++$+++ Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
c01272 +++$+++ You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
c26326 +++$+++ Two-hundred dollars.
c25653 +++$+++ You don't know that!
c21229 +++$+++ AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
c12938 +++$+++ It's impossible!
c11672 +++$+++ What needs clearing up?
c05158 +++$+++ What? My eyes are not lying!
c16002 +++$+++ Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
c13957 +++$+++ He was expecting you?
c07977 +++$+++ Judy.
c11421 +++$+++ And Ryan works at home.
c19121 +++$+++ Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him. Do not deviate from them, for any reason. You tell him nothing personal, Starling. Believe me, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head... Just do your job, but never forget what he is.
c20706 +++$+++ Well, he's really amazing.
c11947 +++$+++ Yes... Isn't it?
c24437 +++$+++ Can't have you moping around the campus. Why don't you come home with us for dinner?
c13934 +++$+++ I want to see her.
c10718 +++$+++ You want to keep him happy.
c21713 +++$+++ Mmmnnn...?
c14047 +++$+++ My God. I haven't seen you since...
c02214 +++$+++ One-seven-four-nine-five Natoma.
c03659 +++$+++ No shit?!
c14142 +++$+++ Take the gun.
c02540 +++$+++ She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
c17747 +++$+++ Oh!
c23516 +++$+++ Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
c23679 +++$+++ Pillow.
c00371 +++$+++ We bought you.
c04187 +++$+++ Then why are you doing it?
c24860 +++$+++ I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
c13454 +++$+++ We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
c00446 +++$+++ Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
c24198 +++$+++ Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
c24651 +++$+++ You're picking up my lingo, hon.
c24876 +++$+++ Minor officials bother you, don't they?
c25359 +++$+++ But where are you going to be?
c13468 +++$+++ Sure did.
c06881 +++$+++ Keep your voice down.
c22806 +++$+++ Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
c05756 +++$+++ What other food?
c01519 +++$+++ No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
c19960 +++$+++ I think you know --
c17132 +++$+++ Goddamn it, where were you?
c06541 +++$+++ Just a minute, I better make sure.
c25307 +++$+++ I'm overcome by your public-spiritedness.
c11819 +++$+++ Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
c22636 +++$+++ I'm sorry?
c18373 +++$+++ I don't know.
c17314 +++$+++ Tommy, come on. Put the gun away.
c18419 +++$+++ They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
c02581 +++$+++ I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
c25902 +++$+++ And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
c01540 +++$+++ We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
c06252 +++$+++ No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
c21568 +++$+++ As I said before...
c26893 +++$+++ Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
c04554 +++$+++ What is it?
c16464 +++$+++ Well, what the hell does that mean?
c14741 +++$+++ But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
c02357 +++$+++ Are you getting tired?
c01364 +++$+++ I got what I paid for.
c21928 +++$+++ That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
c26549 +++$+++ Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
c25900 +++$+++ Forget it. No way. I got here first.
c08043 +++$+++ You what...
c09714 +++$+++ I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address.
c15537 +++$+++ Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
c22664 +++$+++ Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
c20566 +++$+++ An adventure?
c06776 +++$+++ It is not dead. It is hiding.
c20800 +++$+++ I'll have some coffee, please.
c24593 +++$+++ We've only got honey.
c22201 +++$+++ And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
c20126 +++$+++ The scent won't last...
c10093 +++$+++ You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
c12234 +++$+++ Let's see if she can get my model back.
c08712 +++$+++ Right, you got clicks, anything?
c22702 +++$+++ The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
c16438 +++$+++ You never been in one of those things.
c18738 +++$+++ Ugh!
c10913 +++$+++ Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
c14437 +++$+++ You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
c06124 +++$+++ Dear heart, I love you.
c02784 +++$+++ Huh?
c08571 +++$+++ Abduction?
c14642 +++$+++ You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
c19672 +++$+++ Every step of the way.
c26419 +++$+++ We're not proceeding anywhere together.
c21914 +++$+++ Hey, we can leave together can't we?
c10470 +++$+++ Where are we?
c22049 +++$+++ Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
c13911 +++$+++ I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
c03754 +++$+++ There's a certain amount of information there.
c17745 +++$+++ Yeah.
c03120 +++$+++ They report it to the IRS.
c04612 +++$+++ And it's bullshit. And if I'm right, are you going to put the Journal's reputation behind a story that's going to blow up in your face?
c11079 +++$+++ Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
c12091 +++$+++ Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
c27218 +++$+++ That's God's way!
c24159 +++$+++ I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
c11417 +++$+++ And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book/script thing, do you see?
c14193 +++$+++ Something like that.
c20205 +++$+++ She's got no training for this kind of thing.
c01472 +++$+++ And what in your estimation works?
c16587 +++$+++ Not mine, stupid. Yours.
c20822 +++$+++ It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
c11251 +++$+++ Claude.
c00043 +++$+++ Then why'd you ask?
c22027 +++$+++ She already told you, she doesn't know.
c17821 +++$+++ But... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  I used it.  To <u>bargain</u>.  For her <u>sympathy</u>...  I <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"--
c17791 +++$+++ You know America?
c26361 +++$+++ That country shit all sounds the same to me.
c17102 +++$+++ Then I'm over the fucking top and you owe me a Cadillac.
c05173 +++$+++ What are you?
c10381 +++$+++ If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
c17321 +++$+++ What? Come on!
c00134 +++$+++ Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
c22608 +++$+++ Did you see his hair color?
c24745 +++$+++ About what?
c14622 +++$+++ Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake,
c10929 +++$+++ Ta.
c13912 +++$+++ If your husband was killed it was.  This can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
c05540 +++$+++ What do I do?
c10733 +++$+++ I can't.
c00312 +++$+++ Nothing remotely like this.
c11443 +++$+++ You're keeping a record, are you?
c14592 +++$+++ I don't take orders from anyone.
c11153 +++$+++ Can't help you.
c04664 +++$+++ And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
c15197 +++$+++ Excuse me.  I'm very sorry.
c17604 +++$+++ We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
c07207 +++$+++ That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
c12549 +++$+++ I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
c17790 +++$+++ It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
c16767 +++$+++ You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
c08912 +++$+++ Put me on the hailing frequency.
c01429 +++$+++ Maybe Cavello's buying a Subaru. How would I know?
c18377 +++$+++ Her name's Libbets.
c16654 +++$+++ Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
c11161 +++$+++ A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis.
c18949 +++$+++ Why couldn't you stay here with me?
c23694 +++$+++ Uhh... Bacon.
c17211 +++$+++ I don't remember that one.
c26024 +++$+++ Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
c23663 +++$+++ Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
c23854 +++$+++ Someone did.
c13855 +++$+++ Where's Arlo?
c17008 +++$+++ You did?
c20921 +++$+++ Oh, come on Dad...
c00578 +++$+++ She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
c17278 +++$+++ What's that?
c19122 +++$+++ He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
c04898 +++$+++ Who?
c26799 +++$+++ Then shoot him already.
c10966 +++$+++ Gravity?
c03553 +++$+++ Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
c13094 +++$+++ No.
c09139 +++$+++ Indefinitely.
c25429 +++$+++ I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
c04885 +++$+++ Just think... just think.  What happened to our country .. to the world...  because of that murder... Vietnam, racial conflict, breakdown of law, drugs, thought control, guilt, assassinations, secret government fear of the frontier...
c14121 +++$+++ They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
c22809 +++$+++ Just in case...
c23912 +++$+++ I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
c14820 +++$+++ This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
c17936 +++$+++ The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
c25455 +++$+++ I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
c26324 +++$+++ That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
c02891 +++$+++ -- see this, television!
c16414 +++$+++ Six duds in a row.
c18872 +++$+++ Fascinating.
c11157 +++$+++ Hey, easy...
c22891 +++$+++ She's tough.
c13299 +++$+++ You said "Crash".
c15616 +++$+++ I was missing you.
c24610 +++$+++ You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
c13595 +++$+++ Then why doesn't she?
c09595 +++$+++ Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
c16992 +++$+++ You're a bastard.
c08482 +++$+++ My name is Emmett.
c21545 +++$+++ Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
c02887 +++$+++ What did I say?
c20139 +++$+++ I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
c19817 +++$+++ Who is?
c12133 +++$+++ Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
c10367 +++$+++ Maybe.
c13491 +++$+++ Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
c15705 +++$+++ Oh.
c16060 +++$+++ Nine!
c08323 +++$+++ Who said I was jealous?
c01373 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c24308 +++$+++ Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
c14312 +++$+++ Jonas?
c13803 +++$+++ So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
c19531 +++$+++ What's Mom think?
c24112 +++$+++ We have the kids this weekend, so...
c01035 +++$+++ Ooh, be still, my heart.
c22335 +++$+++ Shut up, Jesse.
c13959 +++$+++ He did or he didn't?
c10535 +++$+++ Then what do you think he was trying to do.
c14554 +++$+++ I don't know.     I didn't look.
c03083 +++$+++ That's all there is to it, huh?
c17042 +++$+++ That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
c07112 +++$+++ Yes, yes.
c16488 +++$+++ Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
c11387 +++$+++ So where is young Jonah?
c24448 +++$+++ Aha! What'd I tell ya!
c12211 +++$+++ Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
c04856 +++$+++ Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
c16647 +++$+++ Hey, they blew me.
c18523 +++$+++ In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
c00059 +++$+++ I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
c11038 +++$+++ It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
c24032 +++$+++ You said <u>three</u>...?
c17242 +++$+++ What do you want from me?
c20517 +++$+++ Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
c13171 +++$+++ Because...
c20102 +++$+++ Yes.  I think so.
c19629 +++$+++ It's not right.
c26594 +++$+++ I used to be a nurse.
c26570 +++$+++ And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
c01845 +++$+++ I do not confess.
c17976 +++$+++ Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
c09970 +++$+++ No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. [Beat] Do you want something to drink?
c22627 +++$+++ Can you set that up?
c23027 +++$+++ Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
c04788 +++$+++ What!
c26402 +++$+++ One way.
c14105 +++$+++ If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
c08843 +++$+++ I see.  Well, Octavius won't get much further. They'll catch him and... put him away.  Sad.  He might very well have the truth.
c03977 +++$+++ I'll get the doctor.
c24843 +++$+++ Huh?
c20596 +++$+++ I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
c14892 +++$+++ THIS IS A TRAVESTY! CAPTAIN RHODES IS...
c06381 +++$+++ Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?
c12625 +++$+++ Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
c15314 +++$+++ Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
c10651 +++$+++ He was never able to reproduce them.
c08880 +++$+++ Six o'clock. I was having dinner.
c22240 +++$+++ O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
c06619 +++$+++ Yes, but you said--
c24300 +++$+++ No, I'm going.
c20542 +++$+++ You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
c12348 +++$+++ Don't forget me.
c11568 +++$+++ I never said goodbye, Fran.
c15133 +++$+++ The way you drove that car, I figured you for the streets.
c25605 +++$+++ I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
c00327 +++$+++ The mirror.  You can't see yourself in it.
c16761 +++$+++ Lake Forest Green?
c05381 +++$+++ And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
c26609 +++$+++ But you knew about this.
c23681 +++$+++ No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
c13565 +++$+++ Stop talking like that!
c04497 +++$+++ But, Indy --
c17570 +++$+++ No. No one special.
c18005 +++$+++ We don't have any proof of that.
c07653 +++$+++ Can we do any better?
c26025 +++$+++ What?
c00249 +++$+++ You have nine points left on your license..
c09599 +++$+++ I'm not a fool, Billy.
c02102 +++$+++ Did she?  You were pretty thick at one time.
c26300 +++$+++ If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
c03775 +++$+++ Then get him.
c19406 +++$+++ I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
c07921 +++$+++ There's probably one in the basement.
c20274 +++$+++ A bride without a head!
c08240 +++$+++ He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want --- surrender herself to the police ---- stand trial ---- I don't think he knows.
c19781 +++$+++ Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
c20425 +++$+++ The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
c16050 +++$+++ So she's got a few sniffles.
c07857 +++$+++ You want to do the life of Jesus?
c09216 +++$+++ Yes.
c08415 +++$+++ That was three years ago after that first party!
c17365 +++$+++ Probably not.
c21492 +++$+++ We're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
c10529 +++$+++ I'm sorry I left you hanging up there.
c09190 +++$+++ Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
c14372 +++$+++ Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
c20766 +++$+++ Wayne Gayle.
c22509 +++$+++ Even when you were young?
c17026 +++$+++ I'm sorry?
c08357 +++$+++ Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
c25252 +++$+++ Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
c07377 +++$+++ What?!
c05052 +++$+++ How come? The army?
c19926 +++$+++ More than you love peanut butter?
c19802 +++$+++ Just get me outta here.
c21090 +++$+++ Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
c05600 +++$+++ I'll get your back.
c20374 +++$+++ Sixty.
c11183 +++$+++ You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
c25149 +++$+++ So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
c08198 +++$+++ Because it's the rules!
c20743 +++$+++ I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
c14596 +++$+++ Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
c20192 +++$+++ Which is?
c01849 +++$+++ Tonight then.
c23156 +++$+++ -- this guy with Jill.
c19382 +++$+++ You don't think I've got it to give?
c19788 +++$+++ Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
c19588 +++$+++ Yeah.
c15296 +++$+++ No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
c03414 +++$+++ I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
c22039 +++$+++ Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
c01816 +++$+++ It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
c10012 +++$+++ Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
c21515 +++$+++ No sir, I haven't forgotten.
c04663 +++$+++ Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
c23311 +++$+++ Sit down.
c01933 +++$+++ Had a close one, eh?
c17219 +++$+++ Yes.  Perfectly.
c01063 +++$+++ Feel free.
c16243 +++$+++ They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
c19397 +++$+++ You think so?
c27233 +++$+++ Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
c26226 +++$+++ I didn't mean -
c02347 +++$+++ Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
c13321 +++$+++ What's so great about baseball?
c08515 +++$+++ It's the only place I'm happy.
c20252 +++$+++ And get a doctor.
c13852 +++$+++ I assume you have one.
c22484 +++$+++ It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
c02353 +++$+++ Sure.
c21892 +++$+++ No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
c02040 +++$+++ In other words, scurvy.
c26312 +++$+++ Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
c04585 +++$+++ And you, what do you like?
c05077 +++$+++ We're doing everything we can.
c04937 +++$+++ Madrid or Barcelona?
c18428 +++$+++ I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
c25953 +++$+++ What?
c02479 +++$+++ I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
c24683 +++$+++ Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
c09375 +++$+++ ...well, it suits you...
c19026 +++$+++ Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
c18499 +++$+++ Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
c18527 +++$+++ Too young or too old?
c25500 +++$+++ I don't believe it! You're lying!
c22726 +++$+++ Come on.
c24136 +++$+++ Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
c18230 +++$+++ Oh, I don't ...
c17746 +++$+++ Oh, well.
c09348 +++$+++ You knew it was me all along?
c04951 +++$+++ If it'll make you happy.
c25799 +++$+++ Maybe he just travels in bad company.
c23552 +++$+++ Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
c02634 +++$+++ I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
c01465 +++$+++ What was he after?
c19010 +++$+++ Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
c14460 +++$+++ Is that why you drive this car? I take it that you see Kennedy's assassination as a special kind of car-crash?
c27383 +++$+++ What do you say?
c10321 +++$+++ It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
c21070 +++$+++ Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
c17555 +++$+++ I thought your mom's coming up?
c14256 +++$+++ I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
c27170 +++$+++ All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
c10320 +++$+++ No, s-sir.
c06352 +++$+++ What happened, Mike.
c04140 +++$+++ I'm getting married tomorrow.
c12705 +++$+++ And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
c18254 +++$+++ If you do anything to my friend...
c02564 +++$+++ It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
c00194 +++$+++ I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
c04232 +++$+++ Yes.
c16290 +++$+++ ...Who they playin'?
c01471 +++$+++ What about a summary then.
c08899 +++$+++ Close to retirement?
c05648 +++$+++ He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
c05836 +++$+++ We just killed a couple of people...
c15201 +++$+++ I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
c19006 +++$+++ You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
c16293 +++$+++ But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
c26250 +++$+++ We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
c26176 +++$+++ What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
c25317 +++$+++ Do you know Leon's parents names?
c21120 +++$+++ I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
c00624 +++$+++ What?
c24430 +++$+++ Yes.
c24816 +++$+++ Just what I told you.
c18156 +++$+++ Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
c24438 +++$+++ I have plans Nigel. You could come with me... I'm going places.
c09839 +++$+++ Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
c15704 +++$+++ But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
c10572 +++$+++ ...Asshole.
c17765 +++$+++ They got that kind of money?
c19728 +++$+++ He's misunderstood.
c02606 +++$+++ What do you mean "complete"?
c26367 +++$+++ Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
c07526 +++$+++ What are you going to do?
c03575 +++$+++ Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
c13536 +++$+++ That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
c17725 +++$+++ I know.  H-how much do you need?
c22221 +++$+++ Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
c20079 +++$+++ Forget it.
c10693 +++$+++ But where? I need the street.
c10203 +++$+++ Tomcats?
c00408 +++$+++ I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
c12080 +++$+++ Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
c01686 +++$+++ Chief, what the fuck is this?
c05261 +++$+++ I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
c20105 +++$+++ He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
c26488 +++$+++ We done that stuff.
c22308 +++$+++ A friend.  I was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes.
c18863 +++$+++ Who?
c15116 +++$+++ It's okay, it's okay.
c05334 +++$+++ On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
c12428 +++$+++ I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
c16315 +++$+++ Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
c13650 +++$+++ Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
c02396 +++$+++ Romance!
c18674 +++$+++ Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
c25843 +++$+++ They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
c25796 +++$+++ I was never stiffer in my life.
c20132 +++$+++ You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
c10361 +++$+++ Well, why not?
c18483 +++$+++ I know all you are going to say ---I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife ---there is something about her ----the way she moves ---- the way she turns her head.
c03473 +++$+++ Is that what you're trying to tell me?
c23737 +++$+++ But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
c06379 +++$+++ Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
c18777 +++$+++ I'm fine.  What's up?
c07488 +++$+++ If I had known --
c23082 +++$+++ That's not him.
c15748 +++$+++ Nice spot.
c25739 +++$+++ I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
c19160 +++$+++ I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
c26269 +++$+++ I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
c06532 +++$+++ *You* tell Jim Taylor.
c13071 +++$+++ Yes.
c01648 +++$+++ Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
c26683 +++$+++ We've already done this.
c25996 +++$+++ I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
c06540 +++$+++ Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
c25201 +++$+++ No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
c22195 +++$+++ What?
c00802 +++$+++ Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
c20074 +++$+++ I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
c20427 +++$+++ So take his car home.  Wait.  I'm sure he's up to something...
c18357 +++$+++ I used to know how to cook.
c04341 +++$+++ Look, why don't you and Lila stay here and have your natural life. I'll just go on my way. You'll never see me again.
c03024 +++$+++ Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
c15170 +++$+++ I want him to think that.
c24098 +++$+++ You WHAT?
c11828 +++$+++ Why not?
c20714 +++$+++ Bye.
c13217 +++$+++ Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
c25169 +++$+++ EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
c05563 +++$+++ Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
c07906 +++$+++ Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
c05771 +++$+++ I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
c07694 +++$+++ Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
c15541 +++$+++ You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division?
c08404 +++$+++ She works for tips!
c24707 +++$+++ Of course.
c22855 +++$+++ What?  What movie?
c08228 +++$+++ About forty-five dollars.
c22102 +++$+++ Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
c10190 +++$+++ Doesn't it ever bother you?
c10431 +++$+++ They, uh, they got to my witness.
c18703 +++$+++ No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
c03630 +++$+++ This time...
c12802 +++$+++ You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
c01897 +++$+++ Goodnight.
c14442 +++$+++ Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
c04157 +++$+++ Get out!
c05508 +++$+++ Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
c20553 +++$+++ A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
c10434 +++$+++ What is that to you...?
c25100 +++$+++ Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
c18648 +++$+++ I have work....
c16846 +++$+++ I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
c22605 +++$+++ Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
c00559 +++$+++ His Grace is very angry with you.
c14199 +++$+++ They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at our mercy. Give it to him. That's it. Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.
c09255 +++$+++ What?  Right Here?
c22861 +++$+++ Because I'm trying to build your self-esteem. You're far too sensitive.
c24096 +++$+++ Not personally.
c08103 +++$+++ Hardy-fuckin-har. What did he say?
c18626 +++$+++ I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
c20344 +++$+++ Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
c10446 +++$+++ Come on. Let's get a drink.
c10571 +++$+++ But I'm wild at heart.
c19742 +++$+++ That's not true.
c16793 +++$+++ I'm her legal guardian, not you or anybody else, and I alone know what's best for her. End of discussion.
c00308 +++$+++ He succeeded.
c19282 +++$+++ Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
c01468 +++$+++ She's not with you?
c08693 +++$+++ And threw us into the lake.
c00437 +++$+++ Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
c15640 +++$+++ I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
c06382 +++$+++ Greg.
c04920 +++$+++ Oh, are you? Does she know that?
c13724 +++$+++ He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
c03227 +++$+++ ...maybe we should be lesbos...
c02394 +++$+++ Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
c10643 +++$+++ Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
c08359 +++$+++ Yes, Betty.
c23070 +++$+++ Parked outside?
c01418 +++$+++ You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
c12201 +++$+++ Nope.
c07285 +++$+++ Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
c09919 +++$+++ As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
c23100 +++$+++ That's what it cost, David.
c06472 +++$+++ Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
c25850 +++$+++ Really?  You sure?
c02191 +++$+++ No...
c12927 +++$+++ It was just like in my head.
c24108 +++$+++ You weren't passing 'em out.
c15562 +++$+++ Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
c20068 +++$+++ What flowers?
c27121 +++$+++ People pay good money for that?
c26392 +++$+++ Good thinking.  What's all this?
c05125 +++$+++ Y'know, I used to hate the water...
c08365 +++$+++ Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
c05598 +++$+++ I don't know.
c02952 +++$+++ Which is guy-speak for...
c12404 +++$+++ Then what do I do?
c23189 +++$+++ I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
c02217 +++$+++ A fog bank.
c06412 +++$+++ Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
c18600 +++$+++ Are you coming...?
c01773 +++$+++ It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
c01283 +++$+++ No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
c15366 +++$+++ Raising money is tough.
c24618 +++$+++ How does the family survive?
c07115 +++$+++ I'll concede in the morning.
c17089 +++$+++ I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
c27082 +++$+++ But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
c26674 +++$+++ Name one.
c11897 +++$+++ I mean it.
c24627 +++$+++ You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
c21396 +++$+++ I don't feel very festive.
c07190 +++$+++ No, one forty-two.
c04425 +++$+++ I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
c12338 +++$+++ The monkey.
c07699 +++$+++ Where is she?
c06181 +++$+++ No.
c14125 +++$+++ An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
c14528 +++$+++ It's me...
c22096 +++$+++ Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared.
c19627 +++$+++ ..sorry...
c18181 +++$+++ What're you talking about?
c01265 +++$+++ No. I said Dunbar.
c22330 +++$+++ Booth, listen to me...Booth!
c21004 +++$+++ And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
c06747 +++$+++ Twenty.
c19795 +++$+++ I know, I know.  This never happened.  You don't exist.
c19690 +++$+++ Both at the same bank...
c05072 +++$+++ I don't know what to say.
c10744 +++$+++ You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
c00218 +++$+++ You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
c25833 +++$+++ I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
c24189 +++$+++ Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
c21218 +++$+++ Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
c24161 +++$+++ Because I'll be firing at them.
c26092 +++$+++ He's not?
c06661 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c04404 +++$+++ Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
c26561 +++$+++ My client can't walk, your Honor.
c10026 +++$+++ Good.
c16817 +++$+++ What are we talking about?
c04654 +++$+++ No? No, what?
c06594 +++$+++ What happened?
c16508 +++$+++ I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
c20487 +++$+++ He hired you to build this place ?
c21236 +++$+++ Did you know that when you married him?
c11274 +++$+++ Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
c00868 +++$+++ Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
c01500 +++$+++ Beautiful.
c15044 +++$+++ Good night, Wade.
c18591 +++$+++ Pre-opening jitters.
c04018 +++$+++ "Music for Old People." What does that mean?
c07173 +++$+++ With anything?
c26886 +++$+++ I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
c19216 +++$+++ I mean it, there is only three of us here.
c04639 +++$+++ What?
c18686 +++$+++ Oh, Jake...
c17902 +++$+++ Really? Do tell.
c24957 +++$+++ And it's hungry.  It's been two days since it's eaten.  There are five hundred people arriving right now. The animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  All those people in one enclosed space...
c24443 +++$+++ What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
c15038 +++$+++ Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
c07533 +++$+++ God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
c00837 +++$+++ But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
c20314 +++$+++ I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
c24091 +++$+++ Yet another spaghetti night.
c11748 +++$+++ Why in the hell would you take that chance?
c01184 +++$+++ I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
c21241 +++$+++ Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
c16071 +++$+++ Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
c15156 +++$+++ Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
c01545 +++$+++ Then why go there?
c25909 +++$+++ I told you about calling me boy. I ain't no boy. See, you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy. You call me boy in front of my wife. You think I'm going to fix the roof? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain.
c10607 +++$+++ Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
c08290 +++$+++ You're not like your sister. You couldn't be like her if you wanted to.
c13639 +++$+++ You tried.
c19418 +++$+++ Says she can get me in to see this killer.
c18767 +++$+++ Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
c03696 +++$+++ No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
c08616 +++$+++ Hey. Fuck you.
c18087 +++$+++ I know the one.
c15438 +++$+++ Oh God, this is so weird.
c12197 +++$+++ Well, there is that ...
c22572 +++$+++ I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
c04386 +++$+++ Yours.
c09840 +++$+++ He doesn't walk all over me.
c25405 +++$+++ That's what I said, it's so - it's too absurd!
c15000 +++$+++ Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
c04188 +++$+++ Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
c12221 +++$+++ So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
c26729 +++$+++ But...
c18547 +++$+++ Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
c09222 +++$+++ I feel better if I move.
c25305 +++$+++ Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
c09167 +++$+++ I would be interested to know what we are talking about.
c12782 +++$+++ I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
c18982 +++$+++ See you in the morning light.
c01674 +++$+++ How many?
c13170 +++$+++ Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
c07557 +++$+++ You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and --
c07382 +++$+++ Where'd you learn S.O.S.?
c12316 +++$+++ Do you feel well enough for that?
c23711 +++$+++ Don't call me dumb!
c06445 +++$+++ How soon can we pull this off?
c19934 +++$+++ I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
c26930 +++$+++ You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
c21342 +++$+++ What do you get for winning?
c25848 +++$+++ Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
c20812 +++$+++ You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
c20398 +++$+++ Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
c16882 +++$+++ What about this?
c18126 +++$+++ Very good.
c16564 +++$+++ By the way: what kind of name is Poon?
c16007 +++$+++ It's only a ring.  Not a collar.
c08757 +++$+++ Am I really her?
c09863 +++$+++ 'Bout eighty kilos southwest.
c04523 +++$+++ Yes.
c04791 +++$+++ Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
c19550 +++$+++ Bye, bye, Claudia.
c23354 +++$+++ Young Masbath, I am sorry for your loss.  It is a great and sad tragedy. However... I cannot be the one to look after you now.
c23226 +++$+++ But why Egypt?
c05940 +++$+++ The other two will die without me.
c03573 +++$+++ No water -- What a place!
c01281 +++$+++ Little bit.
c20496 +++$+++ But, he's...
c14092 +++$+++ I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
c07332 +++$+++ What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
c26117 +++$+++ You've got it. I've been hopin' you'd send me somebody with a little moxie ... what kind of program is he?
c01616 +++$+++ No. I should go.
c03216 +++$+++ You know, the green cardigan guy.
c23056 +++$+++ You think so?
c26146 +++$+++ Would you say he was boring, then?
c21224 +++$+++ There are others.
c23203 +++$+++ I don't know what to...
c14682 +++$+++ Any day now.
c04670 +++$+++ They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
c01284 +++$+++ Think it'll work?
c10749 +++$+++ I can't.
c09715 +++$+++ I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
c17186 +++$+++ You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
c25233 +++$+++ I don't know.
c23132 +++$+++ She's a friend of Jill's.
c25694 +++$+++ M'sieu Monescu!
c25942 +++$+++ Whadda ya say I get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
c22803 +++$+++ Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
c24242 +++$+++ God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
c05938 +++$+++ And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
c24937 +++$+++ Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
c18004 +++$+++ Really?  I want to make sure that I understand what you're telling me, Greley.  A crime was committed in New York City?  That is news.
c05701 +++$+++ Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
c17589 +++$+++ The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
c10450 +++$+++ You got a good memory, Franky.
c00060 +++$+++ Cool pictures.  You a fan?
c02356 +++$+++ The husband steps outside; Relinquishes his bride; We stand him up against the wall And take him for a ride.
c04614 +++$+++ Alright, alright.
c11006 +++$+++ What can I do?
c00690 +++$+++ You're not having a good time are you?
c09137 +++$+++ They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
c10096 +++$+++ Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
c04810 +++$+++ Get out!
c04656 +++$+++ ABC Telemarketing Company.
c22029 +++$+++ Honey, he is Mr. Right.
c15743 +++$+++ Maybe I should drive this time.
c20522 +++$+++ I don't think you're very polite.
c15691 +++$+++ It's impossible.  I was buying or selling something.  I've been to Cairo many times.
c00404 +++$+++ Okay. She's fine.
c17978 +++$+++ Did Daddy tease you?
c11784 +++$+++ Jesus Doug, they'll execute us!
c27359 +++$+++ When can I see you again?
c08640 +++$+++ Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
c14240 +++$+++ Two...
c11888 +++$+++ Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
c21949 +++$+++ Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
c22697 +++$+++ Yeah.
c10014 +++$+++ Why not?!
c13819 +++$+++ Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
c10350 +++$+++ Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
c14445 +++$+++ She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
c20568 +++$+++ Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
c23250 +++$+++ To my stomach.
c09496 +++$+++ She came to me for help, she needed money, and I didn't help her. I didn't help her. Now she's dead and it's my fault.
c16986 +++$+++ All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
c27084 +++$+++ And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
c22208 +++$+++ So you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
c00035 +++$+++ You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
c02922 +++$+++ No, sir, WHAT?
c01542 +++$+++ The front door is open.  Will you be back?
c21865 +++$+++ Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
c19096 +++$+++ This is a little different.
c24903 +++$+++ It's OK.
c02735 +++$+++ 'Forgive'...? For What?
c15804 +++$+++ You didn't care about my case?
c09991 +++$+++ What?
c24863 +++$+++ Ashamed.
c25838 +++$+++ What does he want?  He wants revenge.
c19287 +++$+++ That's a matter of interpretation--
c08032 +++$+++ ...maybe I die for Nick...
c00135 +++$+++ Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
c03363 +++$+++ I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
c21703 +++$+++ This gonna take long?
c14595 +++$+++ It's time for me to leave it behind.
c10159 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c03639 +++$+++ Atascadero.
c19479 +++$+++ For real?
c27374 +++$+++ How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
c10090 +++$+++ Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
c03431 +++$+++ What do you think?
c10608 +++$+++ I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
c05986 +++$+++ He just wanted a few minutes before --
c21651 +++$+++ No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
c09424 +++$+++ Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
c11329 +++$+++ snow shovel or anything or something.
c00453 +++$+++ Twenty minutes?
c13166 +++$+++ No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
c26268 +++$+++ One way.
c04242 +++$+++ I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
c21933 +++$+++ Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
c15609 +++$+++ He's got his priorities?
c09560 +++$+++ My God!
c14160 +++$+++ No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
c04159 +++$+++ I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense.  And you'll be an accessory!
c03984 +++$+++ She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
c13705 +++$+++ There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
c11317 +++$+++ Were you always funny?
c04958 +++$+++ Do you got something for me?
c21474 +++$+++ He was doing a great job.
c14801 +++$+++ You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
c18366 +++$+++ No!
c13771 +++$+++ I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
c05496 +++$+++ I think so...
c03748 +++$+++ And her fiance!  How nice.  I hope you'll be very happy--or is that what one says to the woman?
c07768 +++$+++ Surely you'll grant me a final word.
c15470 +++$+++ I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
c03813 +++$+++ She's dead.
c18376 +++$+++ I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
c26887 +++$+++ I guess it's time to hit the road.
c26520 +++$+++ Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
c14158 +++$+++ Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
c10112 +++$+++ Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
c01755 +++$+++ So who's going to know?
c19240 +++$+++ They stole our land--
c24953 +++$+++ We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
c07433 +++$+++ First, you have in your possession certain belongings of mine, including clothing, private papers, furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me.
c13474 +++$+++ Get lost?
c16153 +++$+++ Got it.  Good tip.
c10912 +++$+++ Oh, you've come a long way baby.
c24194 +++$+++ Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
c20650 +++$+++ No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
c07771 +++$+++ He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
c12049 +++$+++ What's wrong with me?
c23162 +++$+++ Why?
c24894 +++$+++ Geez, Mr Crane.
c10841 +++$+++ Thank you.
c14655 +++$+++ Of course I would. We're friends, right?
c06988 +++$+++ Thank you.
c11055 +++$+++ Sing it?
c24081 +++$+++ Ben where do you have to get to?
c19407 +++$+++ I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
c11017 +++$+++ What is this?  'Twenty Questions'?
c07131 +++$+++ Didn't know there was any.
c20858 +++$+++ The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
c01744 +++$+++ You think I'm improving?
c23363 +++$+++ Small talk.
c10187 +++$+++ You always get what you want?
c01072 +++$+++ Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
c05118 +++$+++ And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
c20598 +++$+++ After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
c14673 +++$+++ I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
c01150 +++$+++ Certified ladies' man, huh?
c22255 +++$+++ Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
c12311 +++$+++ Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
c11773 +++$+++ Alright I give in. But let's not end up in jail. Okay?
c19828 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c02375 +++$+++ One or two?
c00800 +++$+++ Where will you find such a girl?
c18080 +++$+++ I'm not gonna leave you!
c22761 +++$+++ When?
c13947 +++$+++ That's like saying they're in Arizona.
c01055 +++$+++ They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
c03496 +++$+++ You wouldn't.
c17364 +++$+++ Who is "Danny Terrio?"
c22883 +++$+++ Productive. So they're closing down the school?
c13525 +++$+++ I don't see anybody in there but you.
c20184 +++$+++ Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
c09512 +++$+++ Okay.
c05009 +++$+++ It's all been a dream.
c01663 +++$+++ I don't know why we have to watch TV.
c05562 +++$+++ I'm not afraid of the dark.
c19683 +++$+++ Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
c03690 +++$+++ But surely Rogers isn't --
c26034 +++$+++ What happened?
c02707 +++$+++ What? Fuck telegrams. I'm in trouble. You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that? When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred!
c16984 +++$+++ Where would I find him?
c24941 +++$+++ What's the combination?
c01266 +++$+++ MAYBE WHAT --
c21187 +++$+++ You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland-- the Middle West somewhere-- a job on a farm... .
c05579 +++$+++ Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
c13185 +++$+++ Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
c22141 +++$+++ Why?
c21248 +++$+++ Tell me something, Buddy.  You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life?  Cause it occurred to me that everyone <u>talks</u> about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and <u>done</u> it.  Do you?
c23083 +++$+++ No.
c12343 +++$+++ I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
c25340 +++$+++ It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
c00185 +++$+++ Whaddya mean, buy?
c03618 +++$+++ I pay my debts.
c12489 +++$+++ --We're sympathizing here, Dude--
c25330 +++$+++ You're sure he said his caller was a man?
c04674 +++$+++ Is that... one person?
c08119 +++$+++ Not these guys.
c14293 +++$+++ Back where?
c12948 +++$+++ They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
c17835 +++$+++ I didn't realize I had to declare a major.
c08659 +++$+++ What kind of a guy is he?
c00064 +++$+++ Absolutely not.
c26973 +++$+++ I know.
c14254 +++$+++ Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
c26640 +++$+++ No birds live here.
c24304 +++$+++ Oh, How'd she get back?
c03533 +++$+++ Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night.
c25764 +++$+++ A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
c17894 +++$+++ No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
c26547 +++$+++ I completely understand ...
c10004 +++$+++ My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
c10488 +++$+++ Was there any trigger event?  A trauma, shock or...  You haven't shown him any of the films you make, have you?  The horror stuff?
c13538 +++$+++ In any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
c09158 +++$+++ Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
c12021 +++$+++ Not sure. How was yours?
c08768 +++$+++ Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
c20804 +++$+++ You still didn't answer my question.
c19835 +++$+++ You flew before?
c25461 +++$+++ No.
c13657 +++$+++ What?
c15079 +++$+++ The seventh day of April --
c27089 +++$+++ Let me guess: retail sales of little chocolate sprinkles have gone through the roof!
c12445 +++$+++ It's already posted.
c04539 +++$+++ I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
c20688 +++$+++ You get her those Vitamin E right away.
c03478 +++$+++ Either one will be fine.
c18108 +++$+++ Ten thousand francs for each one.
c06811 +++$+++ I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
c23947 +++$+++ Uh, I don't know.
c17453 +++$+++ Really...? So what?
c05097 +++$+++ Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
c05174 +++$+++ What's the matter?
c18731 +++$+++ He don't know that. I didn't.
c08694 +++$+++ Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
c20150 +++$+++ But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
c04858 +++$+++ The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
c16586 +++$+++ Then he has.
c09814 +++$+++ No -- no, thanks.
c04771 +++$+++ You must have me confused with--
c19029 +++$+++ But, I am in charge.
c26224 +++$+++ No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
c15798 +++$+++ And you can't?
c24446 +++$+++ Yes, mustn't stop.
c12702 +++$+++ Touche.
c16346 +++$+++ Feel anything?
c01033 +++$+++ Five thousand dollars.
c09221 +++$+++ I don't want you to be hurt.
c09832 +++$+++ There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
c05200 +++$+++ Is it hard to learn?
c23402 +++$+++ Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
c10625 +++$+++ Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
c09080 +++$+++ Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
c20922 +++$+++ Oh, please...
c06756 +++$+++ I think you were jealous
c17480 +++$+++ So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
c27059 +++$+++ As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
c25622 +++$+++ It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
c19755 +++$+++ Why does it feel good?
c19722 +++$+++ Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
c25095 +++$+++ Did the police believe you?
c21791 +++$+++ Brides often are, I'm told.
c05953 +++$+++ I go running down there.
c26059 +++$+++ Such as?
c08069 +++$+++ Got us a motel out Highway 5, bringing her own damn sheets, you read that part? Silk damn sheets. Lock ourselves in the whole week, drinking wine, taking baths, man, see if they got those room service steaks... anything I want to do. Remember when she wrote that? Anything I want...
c13576 +++$+++ Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
c26669 +++$+++ By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
c18570 +++$+++ If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
c21919 +++$+++ It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
c00884 +++$+++ Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
c10240 +++$+++ So why am I still alive?
c09414 +++$+++ She didn't see.
c00333 +++$+++ Then you saw him, too?
c19133 +++$+++ Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
c01174 +++$+++ I didn't mean that, in life.
c07099 +++$+++ Secret, Mr. Chairman?
c13035 +++$+++ In fact, killing people -
c12639 +++$+++ Who, Dorothy?
c05240 +++$+++ Shut up.
c27247 +++$+++ Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
c16681 +++$+++ Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
c00469 +++$+++ What will happen to him, Ted?
c07016 +++$+++ It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
c00540 +++$+++ I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
c03132 +++$+++ How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
c20942 +++$+++ Jennifer --
c02665 +++$+++ I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
c17071 +++$+++ I've got the check...
c02900 +++$+++ Cops.
c26616 +++$+++ But before! Where did you live before!?!
c10274 +++$+++ We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
c07628 +++$+++ Bud?
c07048 +++$+++ Is it?
c06975 +++$+++ I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
c11111 +++$+++ I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
c23942 +++$+++ Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
c17728 +++$+++ Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
c16164 +++$+++ What?!
c03309 +++$+++ Not in this case, my dear.  Take a look. That's not Gainsborough's Blue Boy up there. He's Vigo!
c15237 +++$+++ And not Larry Bird?  Who's your favorite movie star?
c11957 +++$+++ Don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
c23306 +++$+++ We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
c16573 +++$+++ No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
c13469 +++$+++ Come on. Don't be scared.
c00613 +++$+++ Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
c00757 +++$+++ Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
c02699 +++$+++ Look, what are we doing here? Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job?
c01489 +++$+++ Like?
c07461 +++$+++ Then why do I have to go to bed?
c26619 +++$+++ No.
c02220 +++$+++ And she bought that?
c23240 +++$+++ Yes.
c07042 +++$+++ That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
c03248 +++$+++ Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
c22551 +++$+++ I don't know.  Do I?
c17655 +++$+++ If you say so.
c16479 +++$+++ Free?
c10812 +++$+++ I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
c17958 +++$+++ "This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
c00634 +++$+++ Then why especially does it have to be in German?
c20111 +++$+++ It's already been cut.
c09900 +++$+++ Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
c09837 +++$+++ There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
c11918 +++$+++ What?
c01354 +++$+++ Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
c00247 +++$+++ Hi Ma...
c27283 +++$+++ The inside man?
c06046 +++$+++ I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
c02445 +++$+++ So?
c12346 +++$+++ I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
c24333 +++$+++ My best friend got pregnant.
c10848 +++$+++ I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
c00806 +++$+++ Don't swear.
c11178 +++$+++ Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
c15308 +++$+++ As the legend says.
c12106 +++$+++ Dick, you were reckless.  You could have been killed.
c18679 +++$+++ If you hadn't been gassing about Hoagie....
c08815 +++$+++ Can we make it a hundred?
c13891 +++$+++ Summer colds are the worst.
c21783 +++$+++ Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
c01980 +++$+++ They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
c09093 +++$+++ Yes.
c19516 +++$+++ And what happens when you lose?
c08265 +++$+++ I'll be out in a minute.
c00714 +++$+++ And tell him not to delay.
c04676 +++$+++ He's the wrong man.
c17288 +++$+++ Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
c23508 +++$+++ Happy for him.  And relieved.
c02288 +++$+++ I... I was playing with fire.
c22736 +++$+++ Then don't do it.
c02274 +++$+++ I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
c08526 +++$+++ Why isn't she with you?
c23864 +++$+++ No I'm not.  I'm not star--
c03195 +++$+++ But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
c07731 +++$+++ It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
c03789 +++$+++ You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
c24405 +++$+++ Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
c03842 +++$+++ Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
c25976 +++$+++ So my wife is lying?
c02757 +++$+++ If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
c22482 +++$+++ No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
c21304 +++$+++ I'm looking for Maurice.
c18188 +++$+++ Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
c09831 +++$+++ Wait a minute, kiddo.
c02709 +++$+++ You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
c16230 +++$+++ Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
c23491 +++$+++ Let's not get too idealistic.
c14260 +++$+++ None of your business.
c26604 +++$+++ From whom?
c27290 +++$+++ You don't take no for an answer, do you?
c00259 +++$+++ Exactly.
c23855 +++$+++ Shut up, Beth --
c13416 +++$+++ I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
c10511 +++$+++ You sound so sure.
c06061 +++$+++ Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
c27273 +++$+++ Oh, dear, dear.
c10108 +++$+++ Twenty-two.
c21483 +++$+++ You barely know them.
c22100 +++$+++ It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go out to the command ship and await my orders.
c04999 +++$+++ House.
c11968 +++$+++ Also known as Madman Mundt.
c09389 +++$+++ They turned you down?
c25446 +++$+++ He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
c08828 +++$+++ I... I like you.  A lot.
c09345 +++$+++ He's moved on to TV.
c00777 +++$+++ How?
c18306 +++$+++ I was just beginning to wonder. Aren't there shops, restaurants and things?
c19638 +++$+++ Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
c26019 +++$+++ I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
c26967 +++$+++ Claire, I have to show up for the--
c03350 +++$+++ We're all professionals here, Miss ...
c05015 +++$+++ Tell your mother.
c17915 +++$+++ Thanks.
c27062 +++$+++ Nobody knows about your constant masturbation.
c04948 +++$+++ I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
c01673 +++$+++ me up the...
c01956 +++$+++ I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
c16849 +++$+++ Because life is good.
c20482 +++$+++ McCay knows ?
c15316 +++$+++ Did they try and fail?
c22262 +++$+++ Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
c19000 +++$+++ Please, Ted.  I never would have brought it up if I thought--
c01305 +++$+++ No.
c09668 +++$+++ Daniels.
c24280 +++$+++ No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
c25146 +++$+++ It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
c04935 +++$+++ Did you tell him you were leaving?
c04936 +++$+++ I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
c22386 +++$+++ I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
c00722 +++$+++ You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
c27393 +++$+++ You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
c19504 +++$+++ Not for Quincy McCall.
c20142 +++$+++ No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
c20561 +++$+++ Just come and get it...right here!
c12093 +++$+++ Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
c19615 +++$+++ You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
c21715 +++$+++ I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
c26690 +++$+++ I won't do it.
c05921 +++$+++ in case I need it?
c04933 +++$+++ Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
c24410 +++$+++ Maybe it was just an accident.
c14324 +++$+++ Right.  Well.
c06075 +++$+++ I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
c01259 +++$+++ You're the only one missing a grenade.
c13572 +++$+++ Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
c05276 +++$+++ Four-thirty in the morning?
c20597 +++$+++ Harry, I really think she.....
c13779 +++$+++ We need you here. I can bring her in.
c23051 +++$+++ You're a bad loser.
c00334 +++$+++ Tell him I was looking for him, okay?  I'm Dan.
c00982 +++$+++ What did you say?
c07039 +++$+++ Where is it?
c11400 +++$+++ We couldn't be on more solid ground.
c18107 +++$+++ You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
c11321 +++$+++ Who cares? Who cares?
c04671 +++$+++ So she's uh, flourishing?
c12726 +++$+++ You hear about your old friend, Diego?
c05835 +++$+++ Look... It's late, Mr. Eddy... I ...
c23489 +++$+++ Take good care of yourself, okay?
c15962 +++$+++ Oh I bet he is.
c08574 +++$+++ Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
c10914 +++$+++ Would it stop you if I did?
c14361 +++$+++ Meaning...
c25179 +++$+++ Yes.
c10682 +++$+++ It's okay, Professor Tripp. Carrie, Howard, the others -- they're right. My stories are annoying. They go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
c19978 +++$+++ C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
c04149 +++$+++ Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
c20956 +++$+++ Who would know where they were hidden?
c10833 +++$+++ You men are all so dreadful!
c25183 +++$+++ Yes, the Mamma is is there.
c05901 +++$+++ You'll wait till you rot!
c21714 +++$+++ Where the hell is his body?
c23974 +++$+++ I...I decided to give it another chhh...
c26376 +++$+++ It's Grace.
c13275 +++$+++ All right.  What do we do now?
c26794 +++$+++ This isn't a game, Parker!
c15177 +++$+++ Maybe...
c14589 +++$+++ Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
c04848 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c20674 +++$+++ She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
c25820 +++$+++ I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
c06222 +++$+++ It pains that they should do this.
c23239 +++$+++ Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
c16130 +++$+++ Walton, you have to let me see the warden --
c20960 +++$+++ If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
c14790 +++$+++ No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
c24960 +++$+++ Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
c24725 +++$+++ Yes, you remember.
c04972 +++$+++ Bank robbery.
c20028 +++$+++ Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
c11126 +++$+++ Miss Caswell?  What?
c13131 +++$+++ They'll just keep calling.
c13464 +++$+++ You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
c09501 +++$+++ Marge-maintenance.
c08956 +++$+++ But Genesis is a civilian project, under my control --
c22706 +++$+++ Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
c00269 +++$+++ You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
c14297 +++$+++ You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
c04036 +++$+++ I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
c27177 +++$+++ It is?
c18427 +++$+++ I can't.
c06266 +++$+++ This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
c15551 +++$+++ So what's the point?
c20550 +++$+++ I don't need you to be telling me to...
c19901 +++$+++ Yeah, that's what he said.
c00954 +++$+++ Good on ya, man.
c18837 +++$+++ Yeah.
c01635 +++$+++ Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
c01632 +++$+++ Thanks a lot, Mom.
c09094 +++$+++ Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
c14838 +++$+++ Which one?
c18058 +++$+++ Not if they're looking at something else.
c19761 +++$+++ They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!  I mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is this TONY CLIFTON?!
c14899 +++$+++ I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
c11775 +++$+++ And put it on expenses?
c22894 +++$+++ But it's so much easier when we make it up.
c08380 +++$+++ Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
c10544 +++$+++ Terry left his passport in Curacao. We could hide him...
c05330 +++$+++ I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
c24738 +++$+++ I hate the beige one.
c08692 +++$+++ Yeah.
c09131 +++$+++ I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
c02289 +++$+++ Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
c12365 +++$+++ You're insane.
c06820 +++$+++ Do you expect me to believe that?
c00082 +++$+++ Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
c25613 +++$+++ Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
c13241 +++$+++ If you see him.
c19067 +++$+++ I coulda shot you, you--
c20544 +++$+++ I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
c26631 +++$+++ Where were you?
c10207 +++$+++ WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT DOESN'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT?
c13743 +++$+++ If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
c00346 +++$+++ You disappointed in me?
c05766 +++$+++ I don't believe you. There has to be more.
c13214 +++$+++ What's it called?
c18784 +++$+++ What did you say!
c09652 +++$+++ Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
c24938 +++$+++ My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
c24240 +++$+++ A long, long, long...
c02879 +++$+++ No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
c22816 +++$+++ The young girl is slashed again.
c19286 +++$+++ Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
c02974 +++$+++ Five bucks.
c04530 +++$+++ Why he's argumentative?
c09194 +++$+++ George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
c22626 +++$+++ Don't get carried away.
c16499 +++$+++ I did, didn' I, El?
c22282 +++$+++ You seem one to me.
c08504 +++$+++ Rae, all we got is each other.
c01698 +++$+++ Have you no fear of God?
c23624 +++$+++ Brilliant.
c10710 +++$+++ Does he still love you?
c08366 +++$+++ Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
c23706 +++$+++ But I-
c23934 +++$+++ Guess you gotta go.
c04959 +++$+++ I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
c23955 +++$+++ Granted.
c23109 +++$+++ A little bit. Is that good or bad?
c03452 +++$+++ Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
c25284 +++$+++ There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
c21577 +++$+++ I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
c17277 +++$+++ No worries ...
c19440 +++$+++ Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
c14733 +++$+++ Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
c11014 +++$+++ C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
c23931 +++$+++ Should I be ?
c15955 +++$+++ Not at all. Why d'you ask?
c10692 +++$+++ Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
c00950 +++$+++ Yes?
c15333 +++$+++ This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
c21091 +++$+++ I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
c23649 +++$+++ Why, Daddy; you won't be here?
c23540 +++$+++ Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
c04064 +++$+++ Yeah.
c03808 +++$+++ Um-hm. Live sound.
c21338 +++$+++ That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
c25394 +++$+++ Do you think this cross will protect you?
c25503 +++$+++ was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
c17776 +++$+++ No.
c13161 +++$+++ Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
c07391 +++$+++ Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
c00586 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c01202 +++$+++ I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
c26153 +++$+++ Sorry.  Trade secret.
c24053 +++$+++ I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
c13476 +++$+++ Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
c26307 +++$+++ He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
c05715 +++$+++ Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
c21799 +++$+++ At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
c24478 +++$+++ No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
c24213 +++$+++ Lieutenant Quiffer, we're all sorry you were hit, and we'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away.
c08307 +++$+++ I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
c17625 +++$+++ What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
c20868 +++$+++ I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
c25661 +++$+++ Oh yeah? Prove it.
c10566 +++$+++ What'd you say?
c02519 +++$+++ Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
c08129 +++$+++ Will she be dark or fair?
c05498 +++$+++ She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
c18374 +++$+++ I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
c24090 +++$+++ WE are over.
c18816 +++$+++ So the truth is more important to you than your life?
c02259 +++$+++ Where did you come from?
c00781 +++$+++ And almost got hanged in peacetime.
c11202 +++$+++ This isn't any better, Chris.
c12290 +++$+++ I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
c14380 +++$+++ What you mean, Luke?
c21183 +++$+++ I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
c02074 +++$+++ Says who?
c03500 +++$+++ Go home now.
c18526 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c20707 +++$+++ I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
c14545 +++$+++ You're sure?
c24551 +++$+++ Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
c25676 +++$+++ What was it this time?
c22455 +++$+++ And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
c09702 +++$+++ You'll think me very bold, sir.
c11444 +++$+++ Nevermind.
c14948 +++$+++ Neil, you're not gonna...
c05367 +++$+++ There is no other way.
c09467 +++$+++ Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
c24940 +++$+++ I don't want to scare people.
c10715 +++$+++ Maybe I should read it.
c02019 +++$+++ I never *asked* for any responsibility.
c01775 +++$+++ Wait a second --
c00988 +++$+++ Red ...
c08840 +++$+++ No.  No, I-- my aunt and uncle. Something's wrong  --  I need to make a phone call.
c02603 +++$+++ We're working as hard as we can --
c12699 +++$+++ I just got released five minutes ago.
c02748 +++$+++ GET OUT!
c15486 +++$+++ I agree.  But I also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school didn't find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
c15181 +++$+++ What happened to my money, Mr. Williams? <b> INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT </b> Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.
c11523 +++$+++ Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
c02030 +++$+++ You mean somebody asked?
c04776 +++$+++ Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed?
c24117 +++$+++ ...while she watched the kids.  Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer.  But she said...
c01965 +++$+++ Get me the Radio Tower!
c13764 +++$+++ Yeah? What's that?
c03641 +++$+++ You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
c25822 +++$+++ Ain't got time.
c20772 +++$+++ Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
c15119 +++$+++ His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
c17913 +++$+++ It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
c19065 +++$+++ They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
c25472 +++$+++ But what about all these other people?
c03019 +++$+++ I... certainly, but-
c09799 +++$+++ Well, we could--
c24761 +++$+++ Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
c27255 +++$+++ Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
c14546 +++$+++ I will.
c16024 +++$+++ Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
c12567 +++$+++ --what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
c25946 +++$+++ Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
c09585 +++$+++ I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
c12281 +++$+++ Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
c24142 +++$+++ No.
c02183 +++$+++ Can I say something in my defense?
c02899 +++$+++ All I'm saying --
c16597 +++$+++ You sure got the hard part.
c18823 +++$+++ I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
c02702 +++$+++ Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
c19066 +++$+++ I do <u>not</u> like you.
c23310 +++$+++ Very well.
c15032 +++$+++ Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
c03697 +++$+++ I hope the men do.  I would rather the women didn't.
c22156 +++$+++ Ten minutes for ten dollars.
c16934 +++$+++ Things can't get much worse can they?
c23074 +++$+++ -- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
c23188 +++$+++ Never mind. Where've you been?
c16887 +++$+++ --What car?--Go to sleep.
c16627 +++$+++ I never read the paper.
c05177 +++$+++ I think pregnancy is beautiful.
c10186 +++$+++ You want to go ballistic?
c09631 +++$+++ A few.
c10077 +++$+++ Uh, that's okay.
c09806 +++$+++ I -- I was Just going to lunch.
c12670 +++$+++ Thanks a lot, Mom.
c17231 +++$+++ My monsters?
c09861 +++$+++ In this weather?
c00102 +++$+++ Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
c16110 +++$+++ I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
c24927 +++$+++ I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
c20519 +++$+++ Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
c00648 +++$+++ I've taken pity on you, my angel. I heard your wish.
c10331 +++$+++ Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
c12767 +++$+++ I'll tell her but she won't take it.
c11226 +++$+++ But you don't love me.
c23471 +++$+++ What does that mean?
c01838 +++$+++ Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
c01244 +++$+++ I see.
c15129 +++$+++ I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
c19500 +++$+++ We're going to get some food.
c05372 +++$+++ Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
c04904 +++$+++ She knows it's my case?
c07082 +++$+++ Current levels may not be sufficient.
c05861 +++$+++ Oh - that! That can wait. Nobody's going to run off with it.  Say, I've got to get busy. I want to show this whole layout to Chang.  So long. Don't you take any wooden nickels.
c16441 +++$+++ It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
c18945 +++$+++ No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
c16294 +++$+++ Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
c24976 +++$+++ For what?
c06143 +++$+++ Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
c03669 +++$+++ Well, I'm not going until I talk to you.
c02358 +++$+++ Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
c05339 +++$+++ What are they, please?
c11977 +++$+++ Catherine Tramell.
c14075 +++$+++ No argument here. Insubordination rules.
c14262 +++$+++ Any special reason?
c15045 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c25540 +++$+++ Oh, did he?  What did he say?
c07773 +++$+++ Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
c12361 +++$+++ Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
c26159 +++$+++ And you chased one?
c12853 +++$+++ Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
c23424 +++$+++ Mustard's good on 'em to me.
c16493 +++$+++ Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
c24275 +++$+++ Can I talk?
c02435 +++$+++ The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
c06693 +++$+++ I'm trying.
c02650 +++$+++ I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
c12988 +++$+++ You just blew up a house in Paris! This program is over.  Call it off.
c19606 +++$+++ Will that help?
c06960 +++$+++ Bring me forty-five back.
c27320 +++$+++ They're practically on us . . .
c10982 +++$+++ Can you get them back?
c11653 +++$+++ -- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
c22842 +++$+++ Gale, your engine's still running.
c03294 +++$+++ I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
c02179 +++$+++ No?
c09319 +++$+++ Huh?, sir.
c24776 +++$+++ That's a lie...
c05338 +++$+++ Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
c19681 +++$+++ That's not all.  According to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year.
c09731 +++$+++ We can't be sure of that.
c19472 +++$+++ Thanks, Sidra.
c18706 +++$+++ Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
c11779 +++$+++ Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
c11528 +++$+++ That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
c24947 +++$+++ So the method of death is the only connection?
c23344 +++$+++ I hit him square.
c07329 +++$+++ Yes I do!
c04329 +++$+++ I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
c10779 +++$+++ What for?
c21406 +++$+++ This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
c11544 +++$+++ Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
c22952 +++$+++ Kiss me on the lips.
c23566 +++$+++ He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
c25835 +++$+++ Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
c27016 +++$+++ It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
c20454 +++$+++ It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
c24272 +++$+++ No, no. It's an honest question. What are you trying to communicate?
c10097 +++$+++ Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
c24900 +++$+++ I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
c23075 +++$+++ You see, they don't really know me.
c09710 +++$+++ Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
c24155 +++$+++ But what did you get on your SATs?
c17050 +++$+++ ...you didn't close...
c00803 +++$+++ That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
c15435 +++$+++ So maybe this is my dynamite.
c04281 +++$+++ That's the understatement of the year.
c23883 +++$+++ Arrived?  From where?
c14290 +++$+++ John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
c17267 +++$+++ What?
c07420 +++$+++ Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
c10510 +++$+++ All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
c13421 +++$+++ I was with somebody.
c02516 +++$+++ We'll speak soon.
c10212 +++$+++ What do you want?
c26379 +++$+++ Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
c16993 +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
c20895 +++$+++ Have you been to any parties?
c05001 +++$+++ Falsely accused of Intent. If she had that shit -- and mind you, I said "if" -- it was just her shit to get high with.
c21066 +++$+++ Don't get upset, Mister McMurphy...
c12952 +++$+++ Where is it?
c16601 +++$+++ His bride. Cute as a button.
c01159 +++$+++ You're now Mantan.
c12485 +++$+++ Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude--
c01420 +++$+++ It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
c03910 +++$+++ No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
c17852 +++$+++ Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
c10371 +++$+++ We're on our way, Baby.
c14394 +++$+++ What Friday?
c18281 +++$+++ Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
c06781 +++$+++ Wow.
c02692 +++$+++ What do you mean by that?
c27042 +++$+++ That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
c04986 +++$+++ What does that mean?
c11149 +++$+++ --Teddy Kennedy?
c05721 +++$+++ Respect? Well, isn't that progressive.
c00129 +++$+++ Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
c23164 +++$+++ It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
c11256 +++$+++ Now!
c02310 +++$+++ I gotta work with these women.
c10359 +++$+++ You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
c01924 +++$+++ Yes?
c16660 +++$+++ God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
c17586 +++$+++ Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
c15971 +++$+++ You and Regan?
c17121 +++$+++ I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
c14990 +++$+++ Yeah?
c07271 +++$+++ They paid us half. They still owe us half...
c25753 +++$+++ Yes sir.
c10722 +++$+++ She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
c23392 +++$+++ Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
c01439 +++$+++ Nick, you can't do this.
c22569 +++$+++ No.
c14180 +++$+++ It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
c19277 +++$+++ Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
c08635 +++$+++ Whatcha' doin'?
c06473 +++$+++ <i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
c03732 +++$+++ I have a brain.
c02134 +++$+++ Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
c06967 +++$+++ Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
c21995 +++$+++ Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
c13378 +++$+++ Fuckin' walking around with a big head. You better check yourself...
c10984 +++$+++ It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
c25430 +++$+++ It was more to your wife that I gave it.
c02688 +++$+++ What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
c22227 +++$+++ I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
c19100 +++$+++ Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
c22131 +++$+++ I think he might be worried.
c24207 +++$+++ General, stick to the point, please.
c04880 +++$+++ Are they?  Why would they?
c13853 +++$+++ ...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
c02744 +++$+++ He's not here.
c05832 +++$+++ Yeah. Give ya a boner.
c13821 +++$+++ At least somebody likes this shit.
c01030 +++$+++ If you say so.
c07780 +++$+++ Yes?
c16087 +++$+++ So why's he do it?
c22948 +++$+++ Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
c27120 +++$+++ That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
c08675 +++$+++ You're coming up to the scale house.
c20702 +++$+++ My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
c21733 +++$+++ Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
c12009 +++$+++ Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
c08767 +++$+++ You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
c15863 +++$+++ I do not!
c11805 +++$+++ Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
c01917 +++$+++ Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
c24757 +++$+++ I hate the press cases. Especially the weird press cases.  Where you going?
c25314 +++$+++ I'm sorry...
c00364 +++$+++ Why?
c20384 +++$+++ Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
c03592 +++$+++ Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz.  I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
c22153 +++$+++ Kiss my ass.
c03028 +++$+++ They don't trust me, that's the truth isn't it?  Sam Adams never did.
c04479 +++$+++ Don't worry -- I'm fine.
c09542 +++$+++ Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
c19573 +++$+++ Picky, picky.
c25840 +++$+++ A which?
c19052 +++$+++ But, I have no experience.
c17034 +++$+++ They stole...
c13620 +++$+++ Give it over, Dil --
c27378 +++$+++ Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
c01121 +++$+++ I treated you better.
c25025 +++$+++ -- You saw this experiment?
c09847 +++$+++ Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
c09285 +++$+++ Why?
c06700 +++$+++ Something's bothering her.
c21894 +++$+++ She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
c16476 +++$+++ I was nine in the sixties.
c01367 +++$+++ I wasn't saying anything.
c22763 +++$+++ This is not my problem.
c24153 +++$+++ Yeah. I know.
c25096 +++$+++ You've got plenty of contacts.
c17137 +++$+++ Good.  Then you're staying.
c08418 +++$+++ Slaughterhouse.
c12693 +++$+++ I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
c12540 +++$+++ Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
c25081 +++$+++ No.
c03013 +++$+++ JASON...
c06163 +++$+++ [In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
c17436 +++$+++ And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
c22033 +++$+++ Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
c02193 +++$+++ Mommy, I'm scared.
c17820 +++$+++ Your father.  It is not <u>they</u>, who...
c14270 +++$+++ I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
c22905 +++$+++ Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
c09744 +++$+++ A pleasure to torment me?
c00507 +++$+++ Oh, I'd love to.
c16012 +++$+++ I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
c15272 +++$+++ Are, too.
c13350 +++$+++ It's a miracle.
c22810 +++$+++ I don't play games.
c01199 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c24279 +++$+++ You do.
c19860 +++$+++ "Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."
c03177 +++$+++ I don't give a damn about the gold.
c00796 +++$+++ ...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
c02423 +++$+++ I've never LOVED anybody!
c15682 +++$+++ I was talking about the girl.
c21365 +++$+++ Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
c08784 +++$+++ Well, of course, we'd be... honored...
c05013 +++$+++ It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
c10875 +++$+++ Why isn't anyone coming?
c26166 +++$+++ I thought Sonny was the good guy.
c18100 +++$+++ That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
c06930 +++$+++ Why, pray tell?
c14946 +++$+++ But if he said no before then...
c22067 +++$+++ We should slow down.
c23596 +++$+++ Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
c00225 +++$+++ How do you know?
c17724 +++$+++ Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
c12756 +++$+++ That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
c03356 +++$+++ He is the Destructor.
c09385 +++$+++ Ah, there's the rub...
c00127 +++$+++ Okay.  You ready?
c14612 +++$+++ Mister Funboy lives there?
c06838 +++$+++ Y'all never use it?
c20610 +++$+++ Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
c02662 +++$+++ Well I never did it.
c13301 +++$+++ Big League pitchers don't use these.
c25348 +++$+++ But that was her order!
c00873 +++$+++ You sure?
c10672 +++$+++ Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
c15775 +++$+++ I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
c13789 +++$+++ Can you just follow me? The back is full?
c14230 +++$+++ I was just tryin' to...to...
c03760 +++$+++ No.
c03269 +++$+++ Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
c07728 +++$+++ If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
c04506 +++$+++ Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
c14065 +++$+++ All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
c25986 +++$+++ How long's the job?
c04514 +++$+++ Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
c16297 +++$+++ I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
c00464 +++$+++ Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
c04855 +++$+++ Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
c16001 +++$+++ When they coming in?
c04629 +++$+++ What's the difference...
c07829 +++$+++ How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
c19827 +++$+++ How much time?
c14852 +++$+++ Up and around?  Soon?
c13254 +++$+++ You left me a message?
c21544 +++$+++ This is his assertion.
c14504 +++$+++ But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
c17040 +++$+++ Oh, God, I hate this job.
c03207 +++$+++ What? Why?
c00024 +++$+++ Her favorite uncle
c23627 +++$+++ You stand on your tiptoes.
c18915 +++$+++ What was it, Jack?
c00433 +++$+++ Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
c07704 +++$+++ No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
c17443 +++$+++ They gone.
c24399 +++$+++ Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
c23380 +++$+++ I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
c17469 +++$+++ Shouldn't you be taking notes?
c03997 +++$+++ We'll do it next Monday.
c08391 +++$+++ Yeah.
c15206 +++$+++ I thank you.
c07053 +++$+++ Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
c20211 +++$+++ ..not in time to save him.
c24663 +++$+++ Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
c00908 +++$+++ What?
c23813 +++$+++ The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
c09596 +++$+++ You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
c27080 +++$+++ After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
c22864 +++$+++ What are you doing here?
c05588 +++$+++ Be fair, Oona.
c09687 +++$+++ Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
c04490 +++$+++ Marcus would agree with me.
c13063 +++$+++ Oh, good!
c05134 +++$+++ I don't know...
c01631 +++$+++ Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
c17163 +++$+++ Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
c15254 +++$+++ I don't follow.
c11492 +++$+++ All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
c00386 +++$+++ Yes.
c03352 +++$+++ Like a used car salesman.
c01291 +++$+++ You ever been in a hurricane, Mueller?
c01028 +++$+++ Let it be rain, please let it be --
c09409 +++$+++ Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
c18724 +++$+++ I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
c07086 +++$+++ No.
c19804 +++$+++ Right now?
c23305 +++$+++ She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
c10865 +++$+++ Sometimes, yes.
c26724 +++$+++ Now?
c18323 +++$+++ I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
c09915 +++$+++ Is it?
c00020 +++$+++ He always have that shit-eating grin?
c04924 +++$+++ He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
c19148 +++$+++ But you could. You did.
c11469 +++$+++ Good.  You're a good soldier.
c04648 +++$+++ ...okay.
c24814 +++$+++ I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
c12976 +++$+++ Why?
c15202 +++$+++ No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
c16782 +++$+++ I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
c09258 +++$+++ Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you.  Hey, at least you got a job!  Watch her for me.  Stay on her.
c17511 +++$+++ Grace, I put it on the table near your --
c12792 +++$+++ High school?
c05894 +++$+++ Why, you - you-- Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
c06215 +++$+++ We just talked.
c13777 +++$+++ Who is she Daddy?
c13440 +++$+++ Get out of here.
c19200 +++$+++ Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?
c13346 +++$+++ Can I give you my testimony?
c03719 +++$+++ Can I get dressed first?
c14300 +++$+++ And you feel bad for it?
c18606 +++$+++ I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
c05385 +++$+++ Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
c07677 +++$+++ I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
c05722 +++$+++ I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
c13276 +++$+++ Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
c03914 +++$+++ Is he serious??
c13207 +++$+++ This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
c15456 +++$+++ Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
c26974 +++$+++ No.  Can you drive me home?  I'll bring you back in the morning.
c19089 +++$+++ You're mushing it a little around the--
c22471 +++$+++ Unbelievable, she got to you.
c20751 +++$+++ We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
c23734 +++$+++ Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
c03913 +++$+++ Who?
c09386 +++$+++ Him?
c18676 +++$+++ How long?
c17516 +++$+++ It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
c17493 +++$+++ I have to get my head back into my work.
c25703 +++$+++ Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
c00668 +++$+++ Now I'm embarrassed.
c05241 +++$+++ Casper, where is he?
c18898 +++$+++ And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
c03044 +++$+++ They are... friends of Congress.
c23429 +++$+++ I wouldn't never hurt them.
c11191 +++$+++ Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I mean <u>really</u> fast.
c10292 +++$+++ Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
c03186 +++$+++ What?
c14277 +++$+++ Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
c20164 +++$+++ It was an old car--those dents could have been there forever.
c08044 +++$+++ Yes!
c06697 +++$+++ No.
c22305 +++$+++ Gone.  Destroyed.
c01387 +++$+++ Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
c10764 +++$+++ But roughly, how old?
c22946 +++$+++ The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
c27363 +++$+++ No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
c25200 +++$+++ What?
c18895 +++$+++ Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
c04526 +++$+++ Yeah...Who?
c14674 +++$+++ Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
c05580 +++$+++ We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
c17279 +++$+++ You remember Junie?
c03134 +++$+++ You're as bad as Harry...
c12830 +++$+++ If you want me to.
c23638 +++$+++ What he talk 'bout?
c22850 +++$+++ Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
c16413 +++$+++ I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
c21421 +++$+++ Why not?
c02578 +++$+++ You... You can't do that!
c00628 +++$+++ Yes.
c00817 +++$+++ NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
c08200 +++$+++ TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
c08958 +++$+++ Come on, Mother, that's just the military mentality. Never put off tomorrow what you can put off today. If there's one atom of life...
c20586 +++$+++ I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
c08180 +++$+++ Uhn! Uhn! Uhn!
c25860 +++$+++ Yeah.  It's a fact.
c15758 +++$+++ A parting gift from the Empire.
c13154 +++$+++ I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
c07478 +++$+++ We got that part.  Anything else?
c25538 +++$+++ Well, don't you?
c11871 +++$+++ Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
c16673 +++$+++ Yeah?
c11328 +++$+++ Yeah?
c03226 +++$+++ He gives me a total boner!
c10761 +++$+++ That's not a helpful answer.
c07049 +++$+++ Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
c06571 +++$+++ You're not going to take your *suit* off!
c00798 +++$+++ How much of that story is true?
c21312 +++$+++ He doesn't seem to hold a grudge.  What <i>I</i> want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long?  Any thoughts on that one?
c00551 +++$+++ Think of what?  We're fucked.
c27103 +++$+++ That's hard to believe.
c02010 +++$+++ You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
c03654 +++$+++ Yes.
c00155 +++$+++ I guess it isn't.
c01859 +++$+++ Why? What for?
c20380 +++$+++ It's what the maids are for.
c05915 +++$+++ I dunno.  Maybe it was baby supplies, Kay starts the car, starts to pull a U-turn.
c23033 +++$+++ In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
c16936 +++$+++ Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
c27034 +++$+++ It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
c01332 +++$+++ So you never bought any land.
c11932 +++$+++ Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
c18702 +++$+++ I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
c09705 +++$+++ Take wing!
c24258 +++$+++ Oh, wow.
c25719 +++$+++ Then why do you want to go?
c16768 +++$+++ -- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
c26681 +++$+++ Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
c18028 +++$+++ I'm interested in mythology.
c08858 +++$+++ Then droppen Sie dead!
c17546 +++$+++ Sounds like something Tom would say.
c07675 +++$+++ BUD.
c11570 +++$+++ You know I do.
c01262 +++$+++ His chest was hamburger --
c22052 +++$+++ Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
c17744 +++$+++ Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
c26680 +++$+++ I'm calling the police.
c19647 +++$+++ A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
c20780 +++$+++ Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
c17446 +++$+++ Man bones?
c23570 +++$+++ So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
c19537 +++$+++ Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
c07649 +++$+++ The other one?
c11452 +++$+++ No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
c10991 +++$+++ We're the new pioneers, Chaz.  We even have our own special diseases.
c16079 +++$+++ Right.  Bring him back.
c23647 +++$+++ "You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
c22120 +++$+++ And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
c05905 +++$+++ I guess I lost:
c09781 +++$+++ Of course, dear.
c05666 +++$+++ Nigger.
c25189 +++$+++ Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
c11422 +++$+++ Scout's honor.
c22515 +++$+++ I do.
c06996 +++$+++ It's false sentimentality.
c08747 +++$+++ Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
c02529 +++$+++ Thanks.
c14857 +++$+++ Three years.
c15160 +++$+++ To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
c13729 +++$+++ Then I suggest you call one of them.
c18830 +++$+++ - - and swallows fresh ones.
c17659 +++$+++ Well, let's do it.
c17695 +++$+++ But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
c27416 +++$+++ But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
c17193 +++$+++ You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
c17803 +++$+++ I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
c09981 +++$+++ Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
c24165 +++$+++ Good.
c17567 +++$+++ I'm taking over a TV network.
c23506 +++$+++ It is.
c22173 +++$+++ Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
c01228 +++$+++ Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
c01258 +++$+++ You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
c19097 +++$+++ Yes.
c26980 +++$+++ It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
c00947 +++$+++ We won, Austin.
c26718 +++$+++ I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
c20071 +++$+++ The Statue of Liberty.
c19910 +++$+++ No.  Nothing.
c03931 +++$+++ Nah, sounds too "needy."
c11130 +++$+++ --no way--
c01243 +++$+++ But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
c10536 +++$+++ Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
c18264 +++$+++ Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
c24208 +++$+++ You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
c12604 +++$+++ How would I know?
c18651 +++$+++ Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
c14345 +++$+++ And?
c20856 +++$+++ Can you take me to it?
c20027 +++$+++ Like how'd you get this car? That suit?
c26916 +++$+++ You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
c16751 +++$+++ I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
c00479 +++$+++ Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
c08766 +++$+++ Urdu and Hindi.
c05264 +++$+++ Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
c20738 +++$+++ Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
c27299 +++$+++ We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
c23463 +++$+++ Where to?
c25607 +++$+++ It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
c01089 +++$+++ Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
c13918 +++$+++ Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
c16526 +++$+++ None.
c08065 +++$+++ You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
c25663 +++$+++ Look, it's a longshot...
c05286 +++$+++ All you gotta do is look at the map.
c10732 +++$+++ They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
c15834 +++$+++ It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
c08457 +++$+++ Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid game. I mean, at least, I could never get into it. I tried it once.
c20490 +++$+++ It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
c23320 +++$+++ In English?
c17890 +++$+++ Just a couple more . . .
c14165 +++$+++ I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
c08120 +++$+++ And that's more important than finding Lednov?
c25190 +++$+++ And where did you say you were from?
c26323 +++$+++ All I have in the world.
c15642 +++$+++ Yeah?
c10838 +++$+++ And what did they say about me?
c10881 +++$+++ H... how?
c14768 +++$+++ And what makes you think you killed a man?
c13768 +++$+++ But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
c16853 +++$+++ Why?
c25792 +++$+++ Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
c21472 +++$+++ Reinstatement at full salary. Back pay covering the period of unemployment and...
c23096 +++$+++ Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
c21692 +++$+++ All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
c05988 +++$+++ I don't wanna say over the phone, but I think we may be chasing the wrong man.
c08792 +++$+++ What're you talking about --
c17033 +++$+++ Clear...
c04348 +++$+++ All I want's the money.
c27209 +++$+++ We do not go into your courts.
c25404 +++$+++ Really?
c24880 +++$+++ Where is he now?
c21065 +++$+++ When?
c05888 +++$+++ What's she got to do with it?
c25507 +++$+++ Don't lie to me.
c06483 +++$+++ You're acting kind of...odd.
c24047 +++$+++ For what cause?
c07280 +++$+++ Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
c01516 +++$+++ Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
c10712 +++$+++ Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
c05718 +++$+++ Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
c11350 +++$+++ Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
c24743 +++$+++ You volunteered?
c00766 +++$+++ Dude Finlay?
c20691 +++$+++ His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
c17454 +++$+++ Never better.
c17253 +++$+++ You getting my checks ... ?
c07374 +++$+++ The furniture guy?
c04418 +++$+++ You built things.
c21679 +++$+++ Now listen...
c20265 +++$+++ Alright. I didn't see you here.
c04879 +++$+++ If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
c01575 +++$+++ No, Calvin, you're favorite.
c04797 +++$+++ Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
c18757 +++$+++ You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
c03311 +++$+++ Does he ever mention me?
c11697 +++$+++ I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
c23147 +++$+++ Jill's really great, isn't she?
c18482 +++$+++ I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl ----
c10345 +++$+++ OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
c02694 +++$+++ What?
c04183 +++$+++ Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
c01330 +++$+++ How much time does he have left?
c15855 +++$+++ You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
c23478 +++$+++ Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
c15064 +++$+++ No! No! I won't.
c13448 +++$+++ Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
c11465 +++$+++ Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
c25123 +++$+++ Where'd you read all that stuff?
c11843 +++$+++ Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
c01745 +++$+++ I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
c00305 +++$+++ Who is he, his name?
c01111 +++$+++ Just wondering.
c07247 +++$+++ No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
c26247 +++$+++ What are you talking about???
c04525 +++$+++ I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
c01916 +++$+++ For the last time, put them on the table.
c08338 +++$+++ No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
c10209 +++$+++ You go. I'm staying with it.
c23996 +++$+++ That's so beautiful...
c08054 +++$+++ No, you're not.
c22593 +++$+++ Four nights. How did you sleep?
c02941 +++$+++ Chances of recovery?
c21448 +++$+++ Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
c25497 +++$+++ Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
c02319 +++$+++ Okay... well, bye.
c03404 +++$+++ Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
c07800 +++$+++ And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
c17611 +++$+++ Like a real sister?
c25051 +++$+++ What about you?
c24307 +++$+++ Yeah.
c27372 +++$+++ He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
c03153 +++$+++ If you get it back in one piece.
c21943 +++$+++ There's no child here.
c01037 +++$+++ I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
c05117 +++$+++ No, we just checked the beach...
c05867 +++$+++ Centuries! Where did you get the money to pay for all those treasures?
c03740 +++$+++ No.
c25488 +++$+++ Well give yourself a couple seconds, crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done a lotta griftin' in this town.
c12715 +++$+++ Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
c11847 +++$+++ Interpreted by another guy like my father.
c07281 +++$+++ "Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
c10500 +++$+++ Fred Krueger did it.
c24152 +++$+++ I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
c26183 +++$+++ What?
c22684 +++$+++ I'm listening, sir.
c25698 +++$+++ Disappointed?
c14718 +++$+++ I live right here.
c06564 +++$+++ Thanks a lot.
c18270 +++$+++ Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
c14239 +++$+++ The trunk?
c17882 +++$+++ You have to let me go!
c24371 +++$+++ You can stay here.
c21969 +++$+++ Good night, sir.
c22285 +++$+++ After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
c01317 +++$+++ You think I'm up for it?
c12719 +++$+++ Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
c13392 +++$+++ What can I do?
c05537 +++$+++ Don't you know?
c17022 +++$+++ You're actually talking about this?
c00724 +++$+++ But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
c00048 +++$+++ So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
c24297 +++$+++ No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
c07205 +++$+++ So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
c07703 +++$+++ This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
c00847 +++$+++ Patrick?
c17851 +++$+++ Hea<u>ther</u>, I've got something going with J.D.
c24748 +++$+++ Not possible.
c18584 +++$+++ Go on, you're tired.
c03814 +++$+++ Is that the way it was with you?
c24759 +++$+++ There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
c06202 +++$+++ I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
c07566 +++$+++ Your house?
c04625 +++$+++ Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
c04832 +++$+++ Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
c24050 +++$+++ My oh my.
c09657 +++$+++ And the second?
c01021 +++$+++ The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
c13128 +++$+++ We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
c00492 +++$+++ Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
c00920 +++$+++ What're we looking for?
c10514 +++$+++ She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
c13054 +++$+++ It does doesn't it?
c13583 +++$+++ That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
c21701 +++$+++ I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
c10458 +++$+++ What?
c25781 +++$+++ On the drunk.
c02594 +++$+++ I mean...
c18873 +++$+++ Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
c18927 +++$+++ Oh no, I don't think --
c24813 +++$+++ Look, where is he?!
c01560 +++$+++ Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
c00569 +++$+++ Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
c01760 +++$+++ That's your domain.
c09110 +++$+++ If they're even looking for us...
c20605 +++$+++ This is where we are.
c10575 +++$+++ I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
c17552 +++$+++ Mmm. An editor.
c12335 +++$+++ You take care too, Bobby.
c01340 +++$+++ And...
c27380 +++$+++ What's that?
c21255 +++$+++ That's all I wanted to know.
c15002 +++$+++ What?
c06040 +++$+++ Any time, bro.
c17980 +++$+++ Here, take this out to the table.
c10220 +++$+++ What'd you do?
c01999 +++$+++ Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
c17577 +++$+++ Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
c12085 +++$+++ Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
c16213 +++$+++ Then what is it?
c24881 +++$+++ Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
c25248 +++$+++ That was unfortunate.
c05668 +++$+++ I'm talking about a haircut.
c22294 +++$+++ I never really thought I was part of the world you move in, Sam, to tell you the truth.  I'm a hood, a thief.  Big time in a small time king of way.  To the local police I'm a prize, to the local hoods I'm a legend.  But to a guy like you I'm just another two bit hired gun.
c26809 +++$+++ He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe.
c20745 +++$+++ By all means.
c21016 +++$+++ What are the choices?
c19648 +++$+++ It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
c17518 +++$+++ Did he mention it?
c26093 +++$+++ I know you better than that.
c02091 +++$+++ Then who's the Banker?
c15901 +++$+++ Locked.
c02841 +++$+++ No. But someday.
c04890 +++$+++ You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
c20929 +++$+++ I don't know - into the air I suppose.
c26237 +++$+++ I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
c10685 +++$+++ When?
c10746 +++$+++ Yes?
c11925 +++$+++ What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
c06650 +++$+++ I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
c02399 +++$+++ Oh, yes.
c16918 +++$+++ Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
c05801 +++$+++ Sure.
c20056 +++$+++ No.
c07181 +++$+++ You stand to win everything. Call it.
c02596 +++$+++ About me? How sweet.
c00425 +++$+++ Nothing in the fucking house to drink. Not a fucking thing. My house, my money, my truck -- stolen!
c02329 +++$+++ Yeah. And they say smokin' is bad for your health.
c07327 +++$+++ No, sir.
c00051 +++$+++ You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
c05533 +++$+++ Faerie ring?
c07951 +++$+++ Hi.
c26519 +++$+++ So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
c04504 +++$+++ No.
c24697 +++$+++ Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
c16185 +++$+++ I guess...some of them are probably faking.
c14566 +++$+++ Glenmorangie.
c19666 +++$+++ ... The ball... Continue.
c09197 +++$+++ I just retired.
c24665 +++$+++ - and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
c02253 +++$+++ Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
c17844 +++$+++ I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
c02608 +++$+++ I though we went over this.
c24848 +++$+++ This ain't your lot?
c05404 +++$+++ Yeah... How do you know it?
c13070 +++$+++ It's what you wanted isn't it?
c04778 +++$+++ Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
c17948 +++$+++ I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
c11165 +++$+++ I have nothing more to say.
c13505 +++$+++ At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
c05431 +++$+++ Yes -- you are.
c04711 +++$+++ So. Now what?
c01870 +++$+++ Books?
c15258 +++$+++ Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
c23839 +++$+++ You bastard.
c21589 +++$+++ That's an evasion and you know it.
c19309 +++$+++ Murdered him?
c16165 +++$+++ No?  C'mon, Jack...I've got everything I need, I don't have regrets, that's just not for me... sound familiar?
c06485 +++$+++ Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
c02337 +++$+++ Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
c23560 +++$+++ What's that?
c16229 +++$+++ If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
c26449 +++$+++ Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
c05331 +++$+++ What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
c09666 +++$+++ I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
c26981 +++$+++ Tonight?
c20067 +++$+++ Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
c22237 +++$+++ Uncle, 'tis a shame.
c06188 +++$+++ Did you used to?
c19554 +++$+++ ok.
c03661 +++$+++ My office?
c01137 +++$+++ Let me think about it.
c14420 +++$+++ If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
c02695 +++$+++ Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
c06486 +++$+++ But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
c16591 +++$+++ Yeah. Maybe.
c26289 +++$+++ Accident.
c15329 +++$+++ Let me take you to the hospital.
c15263 +++$+++ A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
c05900 +++$+++ Be quiet! Fenner's the best pilot in China. He knows what he's doing.
c21181 +++$+++ Who says?
c06837 +++$+++ Well, let me in.
c21960 +++$+++ What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
c02716 +++$+++ Yes!
c16398 +++$+++ What?
c06158 +++$+++ [Who's the boss?]
c05265 +++$+++ Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
c06504 +++$+++ Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
c07550 +++$+++ Yeah, and what might that be?
c18182 +++$+++ Fascinated.
c21888 +++$+++ Sick of the sight of it!  Well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? I was just about...
c20145 +++$+++ You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
c09566 +++$+++ That's fine.
c15742 +++$+++ Oh?
c06833 +++$+++ Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
c03370 +++$+++ Two wavy lines?
c11431 +++$+++ Well, whoever did this is amazing.
c20562 +++$+++ In the tar??
c12593 +++$+++ Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
c12934 +++$+++ The money!
c00973 +++$+++ Hello up there! Anyone! Can someone call an ambulance? I'm in quite a lot of pain.
c21952 +++$+++ And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
c03283 +++$+++ Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
c08932 +++$+++ Count on our help, sir.
c24351 +++$+++ So do I.
c05791 +++$+++ Stay? They lived together all their years?
c17628 +++$+++ You blame everything on kids.
c14172 +++$+++ You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see who can get the most points for selling magazines.
c00816 +++$+++ Why don't we get a bottle of sherry to sip while we talk?
c06377 +++$+++ And what if you can't live with it?
c23784 +++$+++ He's my father, Millie.
c22548 +++$+++ You'll like it.
c03727 +++$+++ You feel that you're behaving as a woman should?
c11341 +++$+++ Oh-
c20575 +++$+++ Oh...what's that?
c21197 +++$+++ If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him-- boy, I was ready that night.
c08274 +++$+++ Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
c01953 +++$+++ Put it down as a gesture to love.
c08749 +++$+++ No.  I love you.
c17607 +++$+++ We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
c07452 +++$+++ How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
c24948 +++$+++ They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
c09974 +++$+++ In the leg.
c19988 +++$+++ So you're holding my calls?
c13972 +++$+++ Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
c06137 +++$+++ But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling white girls. They gave us the book.
c04161 +++$+++ Hello, Hildy!
c10184 +++$+++ That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
c10970 +++$+++ Don't you remember?
c03274 +++$+++ Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
c22814 +++$+++ Gotta.
c12760 +++$+++ Because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.
c26355 +++$+++ And what does that make you?
c13022 +++$+++ It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
c22723 +++$+++ Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
c10658 +++$+++ You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
c09563 +++$+++ Just what?
c22926 +++$+++ We would have gotten you eventually.
c09823 +++$+++ With him?
c03224 +++$+++ Just now... I went with Seymour.
c08479 +++$+++ Goodbye?
c18355 +++$+++ I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
c20401 +++$+++ And the pony?
c26789 +++$+++ Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
c26121 +++$+++ How?
c09531 +++$+++ You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
c02762 +++$+++ Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
c23220 +++$+++ I'm not. Maybe I am.
c00063 +++$+++ You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
c22004 +++$+++ Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
c16643 +++$+++ All your friends call you Jazz.
c04926 +++$+++ When did you decide?
c19448 +++$+++ We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
c21573 +++$+++ You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
c27107 +++$+++ Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill.
c10302 +++$+++ Right. You're right.
c03624 +++$+++ Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
c12659 +++$+++ So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
c07920 +++$+++ No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
c23252 +++$+++ Delbert Grady.
c24203 +++$+++ How long will it take to receive them all?
c08399 +++$+++ Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
c15653 +++$+++ Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
c23889 +++$+++ Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less.
c04240 +++$+++ Consider Grace, the kids. I love them like my own. And you.
c25161 +++$+++ It's not going to be fine. It's --
c26009 +++$+++ What is the name of your informant?
c19430 +++$+++ What do you mean "don't worry?"
c07038 +++$+++ The future of the common people.
c14862 +++$+++ They could put you in jail.
c08048 +++$+++ Christmas... Eve...
c02724 +++$+++ How much you got?
c21764 +++$+++ Industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
c11044 +++$+++ You were there? At the play - last night?
c01318 +++$+++ So how does it happen?
c21439 +++$+++ Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
c25610 +++$+++ I...I never killed anyone before.  I told you that.
c18745 +++$+++ This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
c21773 +++$+++ You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
c12908 +++$+++ And what's that?
c20748 +++$+++ It's video.
c19455 +++$+++ His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
c21052 +++$+++ Lobotomy?
c06750 +++$+++ Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
c01958 +++$+++ I have. Sit down over there.
c07467 +++$+++ Jud, why am I doing all this?
c12555 +++$+++ It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
c25517 +++$+++ I'll have to try to remember.
c04981 +++$+++ Then what?
c07889 +++$+++ Then what?
c20587 +++$+++ Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
c00589 +++$+++ You're mad! She's mad, Wolfi.
c08335 +++$+++ One moment.
c24163 +++$+++ I don't see why they wouldn't be.
c06430 +++$+++ Ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
c25164 +++$+++ Leary?
c01943 +++$+++ May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
c19769 +++$+++ B-but I have them.
c16962 +++$+++ What about?
c10495 +++$+++ Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
c10034 +++$+++ We're fine!  How are you?
c19546 +++$+++ You and your boyfriend have a party last night?
c18896 +++$+++ You don't believe that.
c22090 +++$+++ That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
c11991 +++$+++ There's Pepsi in the fridge.
c00091 +++$+++ They're not gonna send you right back.
c23296 +++$+++ Just about.  Show me again.
c15543 +++$+++ Yes, I do, sir.
c17513 +++$+++ Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
c10092 +++$+++ No I'm not.
c15192 +++$+++ <i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
c10492 +++$+++ What?
c19885 +++$+++ You're taking this too far, Drew.
c23376 +++$+++ No.
c07729 +++$+++ Ok, bye, bye.
c13711 +++$+++ He looks so young -- when was this taken?
c07475 +++$+++ Louis, are you sure?
c23416 +++$+++ I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
c16633 +++$+++ I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
c04860 +++$+++ No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
c19626 +++$+++ I think that you have to be nicer to me.
c07983 +++$+++ You sure?
c22996 +++$+++ It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
c07032 +++$+++ That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
c15205 +++$+++ Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
c02637 +++$+++ I didn't say that.
c07500 +++$+++ Move!
c23623 +++$+++ Not for a dog.
c06097 +++$+++ Why?
c19410 +++$+++ Great.
c10417 +++$+++ The most respected...
c02031 +++$+++ What's an immigrant?
c05481 +++$+++ I loved him!
c19522 +++$+++ You hearing me?
c11822 +++$+++ Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
c15217 +++$+++ C Duracell.
c14162 +++$+++ Why?  What are you going to do?!
c12480 +++$+++ Huh?
c12915 +++$+++ He probably thinks he's saving you from something.  I'm sure that's what my mother thinks.
c09417 +++$+++ No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
c16559 +++$+++ She didn't say she had no man.
c14375 +++$+++ So then you just call him.
c24653 +++$+++ What does that mean - integrity?
c00354 +++$+++ I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
c11674 +++$+++ Lovely.
c06753 +++$+++ Why would I do that?
c02345 +++$+++ You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
c13034 +++$+++ I'm waiting for my daddy.
c03693 +++$+++ Samhain.
c16469 +++$+++ Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
c24087 +++$+++ Easy enough.
c21988 +++$+++ But why, if I'm not hurting you?
c03889 +++$+++ I don't care what people say.
c11315 +++$+++ I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
c07402 +++$+++ Naw... I gotta...
c19855 +++$+++ In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
c07400 +++$+++ PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
c23175 +++$+++ Well, like what?
c25453 +++$+++ You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
c19014 +++$+++ How the hell are you going to do that?
c08601 +++$+++ Dead people?
c20961 +++$+++ She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
c05798 +++$+++ What's that, Ed?
c04529 +++$+++ Of course you do!
c08847 +++$+++ I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
c05201 +++$+++ Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
c12771 +++$+++ Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
c18891 +++$+++ The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests.  For all you know he was killed at the <u>hands</u> of the police.
c24851 +++$+++ Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
c01057 +++$+++ Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
c18550 +++$+++ Hey, come on....
c24312 +++$+++ Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
c11556 +++$+++ Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
c19526 +++$+++ Guess I should have been telling your father.
c01595 +++$+++ Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
c26308 +++$+++ Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
c22015 +++$+++ There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
c19444 +++$+++ What about after?
c17501 +++$+++ You sleeping all right in that house?
c05302 +++$+++ I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
c13665 +++$+++ Do what?
c07931 +++$+++ I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
c11642 +++$+++ We get wet, we freeze to death in a couple hours.
c26298 +++$+++ And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
c03731 +++$+++ Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
c22517 +++$+++ What's with you?
c25514 +++$+++ Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
c17716 +++$+++ I got two minutes.
c03463 +++$+++ What?
c15127 +++$+++ Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
c13775 +++$+++ Not much further.
c23537 +++$+++ Right.  We have the same blood type...
c04806 +++$+++ Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus--I told them to wait!
c03611 +++$+++ I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
c09020 +++$+++ But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
c04678 +++$+++ No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
c20347 +++$+++ The nose?
c09047 +++$+++ Sometimes I do.
c09699 +++$+++ What do you want ?
c18583 +++$+++ So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
c20823 +++$+++ And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
c19667 +++$+++ ... Two-thirty-seven.
c25879 +++$+++ Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
c18476 +++$+++ That your father and I ----
c17492 +++$+++ He gave me a great deal.
c11759 +++$+++ Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
c05202 +++$+++ Hold still.
c19604 +++$+++ Love you too..
c24414 +++$+++ It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
c03610 +++$+++ Just myself.
c08975 +++$+++ But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
c08580 +++$+++ A star is...
c24131 +++$+++ What?
c15049 +++$+++ How do I look?
c00126 +++$+++ I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
c03192 +++$+++ And how does an image like this help us to see that?
c11255 +++$+++ Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
c18693 +++$+++ Not too good in daylight ..
c17994 +++$+++ This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
c16858 +++$+++ Yes.
c22094 +++$+++ The way Zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, I figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
c23343 +++$+++ I lied.
c17488 +++$+++ I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
c14234 +++$+++ Twenty-four?  Not twenty-five?  Or twenty-three?
c00058 +++$+++ What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
c05681 +++$+++ That's some long green.
c12770 +++$+++ Did you use it the night Marsh died?
c18083 +++$+++ Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
c17078 +++$+++ Harriett...
c07253 +++$+++ Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
c19463 +++$+++ But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
c13647 +++$+++ A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
c13441 +++$+++ Yeah.
c03815 +++$+++ Not very.
c16736 +++$+++ No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
c03235 +++$+++ There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
c12846 +++$+++ I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
c04279 +++$+++ Scattered, smothered and covered.
c06666 +++$+++ What two policemen?
c12761 +++$+++ What about the will?
c09748 +++$+++ How long ago?
c22409 +++$+++ What is Mac out?
c19252 +++$+++ Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
c07412 +++$+++ Whatever you need, I'll be there.
c22187 +++$+++ Ya always in a bad mood --
c04607 +++$+++ Yeah? What for?
c18637 +++$+++ I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
c22231 +++$+++ No better?
c11453 +++$+++ You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
c01386 +++$+++ Sure.
c14576 +++$+++ On guard!
c24366 +++$+++ You're a writer, you said.
c25086 +++$+++ "Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
c26378 +++$+++ Accident.
c12061 +++$+++ A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
c01551 +++$+++ Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
c07691 +++$+++ What's the listing?
c06479 +++$+++ Why?
c22984 +++$+++ My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
c01997 +++$+++ Which I didn't have.
c13524 +++$+++ I don't know if I can do it alone.
c07180 +++$+++ No.
c19350 +++$+++ I'm sure.  He's dead.
c15790 +++$+++ ... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
c27261 +++$+++ I don't blame you for that.
c14983 +++$+++ Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
c04724 +++$+++ Mm.
c19656 +++$+++ Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
c23724 +++$+++ Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
c15853 +++$+++ Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
c20994 +++$+++ Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
c05720 +++$+++ I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
c16899 +++$+++ How do I square the accident?
c25196 +++$+++ People say that?
c26476 +++$+++ Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
c00919 +++$+++ ...You wanna work -- here?
c24798 +++$+++ Have you gone to the police?
c21778 +++$+++ I leave extras, miss.
c19152 +++$+++ Yes, miss.
c17235 +++$+++ Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
c10102 +++$+++ Are you all right?
c26559 +++$+++ Nothing happened.
c15928 +++$+++ A lovestruck page!
c00514 +++$+++ He didn't recognize me.
c10433 +++$+++ You're talking like a drunk.
c11164 +++$+++ So?
c08785 +++$+++ Win made his choices, Claire.  We all do --
c20499 +++$+++ A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
c02967 +++$+++ Me!? You where the one...
c26161 +++$+++ I don't know.  I have to think...
c16287 +++$+++ Where're you going?
c24215 +++$+++ Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
c19080 +++$+++ So I don't like tents, why--
c25918 +++$+++ I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
c02033 +++$+++ Really! Is it serious?
c05530 +++$+++ To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
c21114 +++$+++ Just moved in with his girlfriend.
c16411 +++$+++ What list?
c11120 +++$+++ I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
c05850 +++$+++ Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
c14269 +++$+++ You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
c03879 +++$+++ But they have.
c03498 +++$+++ Thank you.  Benjamin --
c18690 +++$+++ Is it your vehicle?
c22888 +++$+++ I don't know. I guess.
c11207 +++$+++ I don't get it, that really works?
c21386 +++$+++ Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
c26934 +++$+++ I started seeing things.
c24686 +++$+++ It, John.  Not him.  It.
c05749 +++$+++ I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
c27241 +++$+++ Hickory!
c10191 +++$+++ Where'd you get it.
c15344 +++$+++ Will he be okay?
c24052 +++$+++ How are you getting on with these fine people?
c06292 +++$+++ What's wrong with him?
c11842 +++$+++ You think so.
c19034 +++$+++ Did you receive the letter?
c13838 +++$+++ ...take my sorry old truck.
c11427 +++$+++ They're nothing like us.
c06579 +++$+++ I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
c25992 +++$+++ He won.  He was a winner.  That bothers you.
c26747 +++$+++ Was that difficult to get?
c02527 +++$+++ I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
c14823 +++$+++ It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
c08336 +++$+++ He said immediately.
c07667 +++$+++ Well it's big. And it's blue ...  ... It's really really blue.
c20750 +++$+++ She sings? What does she sing?
c13181 +++$+++ As long as that's your only problem you're...
c06448 +++$+++ Why's it gotta be Tommy!
c04087 +++$+++ Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
c20776 +++$+++ They done that too long in my family.
c09533 +++$+++ Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
c24305 +++$+++ The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
c23351 +++$+++ For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
c13351 +++$+++ I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
c24781 +++$+++ Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
c17221 +++$+++ More your line.
c15008 +++$+++ Pow.
c06409 +++$+++ How long?
c20277 +++$+++ You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
c24560 +++$+++ Did I do good, Mr. Luthor?
c05576 +++$+++ No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
c02830 +++$+++ What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
c03845 +++$+++ To his own daughter?
c01942 +++$+++ By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
c17452 +++$+++ I sell BMW's. What do you do?
c09513 +++$+++ Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
c17788 +++$+++ Why did you look at me that way?
c12557 +++$+++ I don't know yet.
c06689 +++$+++ Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
c13189 +++$+++ I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
c07792 +++$+++ What thought is that?
c04686 +++$+++ Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
c02429 +++$+++ I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
c04749 +++$+++ But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why--
c08560 +++$+++ Is she here tonight?
c07574 +++$+++ Give my regards to your managing editor.
c07858 +++$+++ I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
c04143 +++$+++ I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
c24265 +++$+++ Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
c06180 +++$+++ There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
c09406 +++$+++ I'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
c20655 +++$+++ Close your eyes.
c25606 +++$+++ You still got a map on you?
c00740 +++$+++ Don't you forget that I'm still the head man around here too. Now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. You and I are going out together. How's that?
c08647 +++$+++ I loved you. I loved --
c23995 +++$+++ Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
c02523 +++$+++ Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
c14101 +++$+++ No, she's getting married.
c18012 +++$+++ The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
c09432 +++$+++ No.
c01048 +++$+++ Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
c21279 +++$+++ Those guys bother you?
c05441 +++$+++ Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
c21735 +++$+++ No?  Why's that?
c04510 +++$+++ What?!
c07255 +++$+++ There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
c20048 +++$+++ They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you."
c01203 +++$+++ Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
c05030 +++$+++ See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
c06680 +++$+++ -- Which I don't necessarily agree.
c21619 +++$+++ No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
c03302 +++$+++ I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
c15764 +++$+++ It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
c08533 +++$+++ She doesn't want pity.
c02587 +++$+++ I can reconfigure the scan for C-12, amylase proteins.
c12313 +++$+++ Yes. I will.
c08354 +++$+++ I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
c21755 +++$+++ I've never treated you like a whore.
c17860 +++$+++ Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
c11285 +++$+++ I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
c00049 +++$+++ How?
c01714 +++$+++ OK. Go ahead.
c16303 +++$+++ Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
c03790 +++$+++ If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
c25028 +++$+++ I think they have that covered.
c07275 +++$+++ ...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
c00895 +++$+++ Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
c24406 +++$+++ But what will happen?
c14351 +++$+++ Yes.  Very much.
c26858 +++$+++ A proud tradition.
c10205 +++$+++ What is he doing?
c20470 +++$+++ It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
c22828 +++$+++ Asshole, Can't talk.
c26191 +++$+++ I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
c01960 +++$+++ I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
c02613 +++$+++ Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
c15358 +++$+++ That's right...
c13592 +++$+++ Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
c16548 +++$+++ Remember me, from the pool?
c00564 +++$+++ Don't bother.
c27075 +++$+++ There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
c19355 +++$+++ I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
c21270 +++$+++ Basically.  Yeah.  If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
c05016 +++$+++ Don't go.
c13455 +++$+++ You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
c26430 +++$+++ No Jeremy.
c09945 +++$+++ [Beat] What's your name?
c13112 +++$+++ No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
c25583 +++$+++ I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
c11156 +++$+++ You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
c10855 +++$+++ Anything... may I sit down?
c19739 +++$+++ Do you remember what you said?
c01458 +++$+++ Death.
c24872 +++$+++ Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits.
c09552 +++$+++ You want to canvass?
c23821 +++$+++ Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
c03851 +++$+++ Lady, let me get this straight.
c04008 +++$+++ You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
c09120 +++$+++ Thank you, Captain.
c06364 +++$+++ You have to. It's a tradition.
c12066 +++$+++ You're not the Mayor.
c01061 +++$+++ Really?
c01346 +++$+++ I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
c01401 +++$+++ WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
c15485 +++$+++ Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
c26997 +++$+++ ...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
c20866 +++$+++ Maybe something's onto him.
c26835 +++$+++ Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
c03193 +++$+++ I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
c21481 +++$+++ 'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
c10152 +++$+++ We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
c22011 +++$+++ Now look, boy, get a grip on yourself. Rose had a good life. She found her. Right, didn't she? She triumphed over everything, what are you blubbering about?
c04945 +++$+++ Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
c14176 +++$+++ That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
c01443 +++$+++ And I'm supposed to care?
c19580 +++$+++ Go fuck myself?
c02826 +++$+++ I see it before me.
c09011 +++$+++ What do you mean now?
c17246 +++$+++ Yeah.
c05087 +++$+++ He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
c14609 +++$+++ It's only a flesh wound.
c22474 +++$+++ This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
c05542 +++$+++ And who might that be?
c23084 +++$+++ It tastes different.
c22478 +++$+++ You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
c12964 +++$+++ I'm glad you did.
c17295 +++$+++ I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
c16136 +++$+++ I'm just having some fun.
c20449 +++$+++ No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
c26898 +++$+++ Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
c07279 +++$+++ Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
c06342 +++$+++ Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
c26593 +++$+++ How old is he?
c02880 +++$+++ I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
c06408 +++$+++ But what if he doesn't --
c18418 +++$+++ You both did it?
c07735 +++$+++ You want a number for a psychiatrist, I can get you one, that's not a problem. but what exactly is wrong?
c07169 +++$+++ It doesn't make any difference where she is.
c07636 +++$+++ So.
c06737 +++$+++ No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
c19661 +++$+++ But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous --
c01665 +++$+++ The Duke?  What did you do?
c23762 +++$+++ I don't need the stinking pro-tour.
c19486 +++$+++ I don't.
c20589 +++$+++ Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
c13542 +++$+++ Well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
c01031 +++$+++ You're kidding.
c16097 +++$+++ So how's the cat food business?
c01464 +++$+++ When?
c00588 +++$+++ He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
c17929 +++$+++ Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
c11245 +++$+++ Before the coma!
c03930 +++$+++ I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
c06517 +++$+++ You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
c25717 +++$+++ No--yours, madame.
c13529 +++$+++ He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
c15530 +++$+++ More.
c04175 +++$+++ It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
c21869 +++$+++ Oh, Bialy, please, just a little. Just a little.
c23340 +++$+++ Really.
c17214 +++$+++ It's from the first World War, isn't it?
c18088 +++$+++ She didn't answer.
c22016 +++$+++ Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
c09587 +++$+++ There's porno theatres for that.
c11845 +++$+++ But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
c24001 +++$+++ Wat...
c17914 +++$+++ You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
c25868 +++$+++ So why did you leave?
c17951 +++$+++ You just can't bear the idea of good news.
c13660 +++$+++ Aye, I do, Peter.
c13475 +++$+++ You are.
c01669 +++$+++ Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
c15375 +++$+++ No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
c23481 +++$+++ So what's the time?
c14913 +++$+++ He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
c23849 +++$+++ Doesn't say.
c26384 +++$+++ I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
c07745 +++$+++ This is a bunch of bullshit.
c18273 +++$+++ I filed it yesterday.
c10313 +++$+++ "...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
c08660 +++$+++ I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
c05744 +++$+++ Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
c17602 +++$+++ An accident?
c02446 +++$+++ Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
c06133 +++$+++ No, each of us must relearn that work is the only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting that we are nothing, while He is all.
c01846 +++$+++ I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
c10151 +++$+++ -- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
c00246 +++$+++ Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
c15637 +++$+++ Yeah.
c15085 +++$+++ No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
c01051 +++$+++ This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
c10384 +++$+++ You know, I did come home, come to think of it, on Thursday. I had a severe headache and I was driving in the neighborhood so I just darted in and out of the house.  Where were you, Laura? I didn't see you?
c25910 +++$+++ I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
c08446 +++$+++ Yeah? Like what?
c22824 +++$+++ I have this button I press. See? It insulates me. She mimes an air lock valve.
c22811 +++$+++ No, wait...
c09254 +++$+++ What kind of things exactly?
c06058 +++$+++ Yeah, me too. You're a fucking bull in a china shop.
c11522 +++$+++ No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
c17571 +++$+++ I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
c21244 +++$+++ You at least bring the gun?
c09770 +++$+++ Are you ok?
c04975 +++$+++ With Ordell?
c00391 +++$+++ Fuck you.
c02487 +++$+++ You're not ready.
c16073 +++$+++ Is that important?
c27456 +++$+++ GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
c00829 +++$+++ Pull out, goddamnit!
c00376 +++$+++ Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be such a hardass. I know you got problems, but everybody's got problems.
c04626 +++$+++ You ready...?
c12571 +++$+++ That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
c12286 +++$+++ Yes. I like that name very much.
c00547 +++$+++ These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
c22301 +++$+++ In a minute.
c21488 +++$+++ So why isn't it all bloody?
c12210 +++$+++ Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
c14056 +++$+++ I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
c00755 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c15409 +++$+++ Sure.
c14259 +++$+++ Then what are you?
c00361 +++$+++ We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
c18368 +++$+++ You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
c09899 +++$+++ Tonight's the night?
c21533 +++$+++ What?
c13528 +++$+++ I didn't hurt you.
c24958 +++$+++ How many storage areas are there?
c23729 +++$+++ Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
c03994 +++$+++ What did I say?
c23909 +++$+++ You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
c17100 +++$+++ Have a good trip.
c04024 +++$+++ I dunno.
c05150 +++$+++ That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
c20853 +++$+++ Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
c00229 +++$+++ Hey, two days with him is enough.
c27361 +++$+++ We can't leave now. We have to do something.
c12723 +++$+++ No.
c13134 +++$+++ You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
c20472 +++$+++ Yeah, what for?
c24246 +++$+++ Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
c00593 +++$+++ People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
c08573 +++$+++ Dark?
c07515 +++$+++ Do you think she loves him?
c08284 +++$+++ Maybe you want to go.
c05464 +++$+++ That's astonishing. Sera, look...
c22164 +++$+++ Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
c02592 +++$+++ Can you see a body?
c12522 +++$+++ But, he could've --
c04084 +++$+++ Tradition.
c07101 +++$+++ I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
c01711 +++$+++ I keep it for emergencies.
c25273 +++$+++ Have you finished?
c01804 +++$+++ What's going on in Berlin?
c27199 +++$+++ I've seen pictures.
c14884 +++$+++ I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
c26639 +++$+++ Why?
c16260 +++$+++ Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
c20392 +++$+++ No.
c25587 +++$+++ They're not going to--
c10362 +++$+++ Sure. What do you want me to call you?
c05066 +++$+++ The Ladder?
c09901 +++$+++ You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
c14521 +++$+++ I like those sapphire earrings myself.
c13434 +++$+++ Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
c20474 +++$+++ Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
c10502 +++$+++ No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
c19243 +++$+++ The--the officers.
c26103 +++$+++ where's your program? Won't it miss you?
c00383 +++$+++ No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. Where do you get this stuff? From your mother?
c20556 +++$+++ You would.
c13335 +++$+++ Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
c09119 +++$+++ Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
c26445 +++$+++ Uh... a little, maybe.
c12195 +++$+++ Welsh.
c15792 +++$+++ I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
c22771 +++$+++ Any reason to think next month will be worse?
c06523 +++$+++ Waiter!
c16714 +++$+++ Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
c13870 +++$+++ Look, pal. I make an honest living. People don't come to me unless they're miserable and I help 'em out of a bad situation. I don't kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
c13326 +++$+++ If you believe in Voodoo.
c08664 +++$+++ Also boring.
c17002 +++$+++ Scotch, please.
c07903 +++$+++ We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
c01877 +++$+++ I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
c16500 +++$+++ Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
c22988 +++$+++ Do I look like it that much?
c10021 +++$+++ Yeah, you want it?
c06465 +++$+++ Luciano is dead?
c04734 +++$+++ I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
c15949 +++$+++ Oh no, that was no spasm. I got on the bed, the whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking. The whole thing, with me on it!
c13847 +++$+++ I'll do it.
c25660 +++$+++ Only once, at Redstone.
c10921 +++$+++ How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
c25012 +++$+++ Why don't you go home to the old lady --
c25414 +++$+++ I know.
c22243 +++$+++ What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
c14723 +++$+++ Why didn't you run after them?
c05931 +++$+++ It's... coming.
c25267 +++$+++ I'm impressed. That information could have cost me PS20,000.
c06909 +++$+++ When'll the skiff be ready?
c04448 +++$+++ You try Martin?
c05095 +++$+++ Did you like it?
c23365 +++$+++ Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions.
c11836 +++$+++ You.
c12775 +++$+++ No.  She stopped by to pick up some papers.
c27224 +++$+++ Yes.
c12103 +++$+++ Acceptable losses in a battle to save the planet.
c19035 +++$+++ Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
c16956 +++$+++ What about?
c09045 +++$+++ I wish I could spare a few centuries to learn.
c09511 +++$+++ There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
c24596 +++$+++ No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was him on the phone just now.  He was calling to see how you were.
c18432 +++$+++ That's all past, Lestat.
c14747 +++$+++ Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
c16901 +++$+++ Not that.
c07541 +++$+++ Do you have something to bring me down?
c06023 +++$+++ Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
c25242 +++$+++ But it doesn't eat what it kills.
c00850 +++$+++ There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
c01164 +++$+++ Go on.  Good so far.
c20170 +++$+++ I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
c19127 +++$+++ You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
c01092 +++$+++ Really? No kidding.
c25083 +++$+++ They are - private - letters.
c22336 +++$+++ OK.  I love you.
c16552 +++$+++ How you treat them?
c11520 +++$+++ Good night, Mr. Baxter.
c04411 +++$+++ Yes.
c25130 +++$+++ With you there's a tragic dimension.
c08431 +++$+++ Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
c09089 +++$+++ There's a red light on the second intake valve.
c09543 +++$+++ You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
c16072 +++$+++ Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
c13736 +++$+++ Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --
c01512 +++$+++ Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
c19146 +++$+++ He kills w-
c10600 +++$+++ I do.
c10645 +++$+++ Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
c21785 +++$+++ I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
c03151 +++$+++ I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
c12708 +++$+++ No, I never.  I would not do that, George.  Never.
c24245 +++$+++ Shit.
c24039 +++$+++ Could you tell me where a fellow goes to get a drink in this town?
c16774 +++$+++ Good night, beautiful.
c19239 +++$+++ Leave your sister out of it.
c00651 +++$+++ She didn't say. But she says it's urgent.
c06973 +++$+++ Count d'Algout...
c23892 +++$+++ Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
c13243 +++$+++ I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
c27149 +++$+++ No you don't.
c23415 +++$+++ We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
c18275 +++$+++ I'm sure you do.
c13704 +++$+++ Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
c17227 +++$+++ Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
c25821 +++$+++ I'll explain later--
c19138 +++$+++ I didn't.
c16921 +++$+++ Yeah... I know.
c01680 +++$+++ Of course they were. How many?
c21557 +++$+++ You know what I'm talking about!
c15189 +++$+++ What was your business with Lateesha that day?
c10567 +++$+++ About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
c06186 +++$+++ What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
c04634 +++$+++ What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
c21499 +++$+++ Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
c14587 +++$+++ I'll give them to you.
c18380 +++$+++ I have to go to the bathroom.
c02864 +++$+++ Whassamatta?
c03027 +++$+++ Ben Franklin's going to Paris, but I think the French will be long on talk and short on guns.  Our troops are mobs, they won't take orders, have no equipment... could they beat the British?
c07682 +++$+++ Yeah ...
c23028 +++$+++ You can bring them with a word.
c23867 +++$+++ But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
c10122 +++$+++ What about the allies? Congress? I think we may need to start letting key people know. And they're all scattered across the country for the campaign. We're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up. Jesus... I don't even know if we've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours.
c06896 +++$+++ Fuckin' A.
c14917 +++$+++ But...
c05462 +++$+++ Thank you. What time is it?
c20701 +++$+++ Yes, sir. I need a room
c05994 +++$+++ The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
c26860 +++$+++ It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
c25166 +++$+++ 'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please...
c00594 +++$+++ I was. But she quite outgrew the little I could show her.
c24624 +++$+++ You could see the speedometer?
c06825 +++$+++ He's downstairs -- somewhere.
c20408 +++$+++ Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
c11939 +++$+++ ...Who?
c18293 +++$+++ ...adenoids.
c05274 +++$+++ You've heard the stories right?
c20162 +++$+++ I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
c01833 +++$+++ While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
c06599 +++$+++ Now, what do you see?
c25155 +++$+++ Steve...
c24896 +++$+++ You're an enthusiast.
c25097 +++$+++ Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
c22715 +++$+++ Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
c26841 +++$+++ "Freedom."
c21964 +++$+++ It's all yours.
c12766 +++$+++ He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
c07589 +++$+++ Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
c19246 +++$+++ Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
c16798 +++$+++ Since the school is closing anyway, I'm going to write that novel I've been threatening on everybody.
c24890 +++$+++ I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
c12957 +++$+++ Caesar is your husband?
c08447 +++$+++ Um... did you still want to read my novel?
c26030 +++$+++ Can I see you again?
c13672 +++$+++ Like what?
c12467 +++$+++ He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
c24467 +++$+++ What?
c17813 +++$+++ You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
c18324 +++$+++ Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
c02421 +++$+++ Those things in your hands.
c09290 +++$+++ But I mean isn't he Faith's new--
c03205 +++$+++ I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
c02846 +++$+++ No. He had more important work.
c22863 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c12109 +++$+++ You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
c17708 +++$+++ Yeah...but you're not dying!
c20511 +++$+++ Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
c19209 +++$+++ Just carrying a bag.
c23999 +++$+++ Big day last night.
c16547 +++$+++ What?
c03373 +++$+++ You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
c20673 +++$+++ Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
c22110 +++$+++ You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
c18141 +++$+++ Pack the bags, we have to move.
c02863 +++$+++ I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
c27069 +++$+++ That explains the emptiness that haunts me.
c18677 +++$+++ I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
c06009 +++$+++ You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
c24476 +++$+++ Thank ...you.
c25286 +++$+++ Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
c07733 +++$+++ YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
c03967 +++$+++ Shit.
c25864 +++$+++ No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
c00584 +++$+++ I see.
c13013 +++$+++ So get the hell out of here.
c14945 +++$+++ And now he will?
c18300 +++$+++ Is this disease common in the tropics?
c22808 +++$+++ Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
c06434 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c08937 +++$+++ You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
c20950 +++$+++ Yeah, but here you are.  How'd I get so lucky?  I thought you were trying to forget I was alive.
c04203 +++$+++ I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
c07521 +++$+++ Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
c04611 +++$+++ P.J.'s.
c11509 +++$+++ Do I have to?
c20136 +++$+++ It has no nobility.
c15187 +++$+++ I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
c04624 +++$+++ They own the information he's disclosing. The truer it is, the greater the damage to them. If he lied, he didn't disclose their information. And the damages are smaller.
c12293 +++$+++ Thank you, Ben.
c26847 +++$+++ Yes, but there wasn't a War.
c18822 +++$+++ - - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
c08314 +++$+++ Apparently.
c21841 +++$+++ Oooooooops!
c08394 +++$+++ Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
c27239 +++$+++ Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
c04151 +++$+++ Just for the first year.
c07211 +++$+++ Do you know why I'm here?
c17585 +++$+++ What? whatwhatwhat?
c04306 +++$+++ Not in front of the boy.
c06708 +++$+++ And this is legitimate therapy?
c09941 +++$+++ I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
c06682 +++$+++ Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
c03615 +++$+++ That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
c02820 +++$+++ No! No!
c07757 +++$+++ Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
c14313 +++$+++ I want to believe you, too.
c13998 +++$+++ I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
c26177 +++$+++ Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
c10958 +++$+++ Do I have to raise me voice?
c23241 +++$+++ Room 237?
c18154 +++$+++ Please do not talk like this.
c07990 +++$+++ Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
c14818 +++$+++ She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
c26505 +++$+++ Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind. He does not change it.
c09817 +++$+++ How long will that take?
c13250 +++$+++ Something like that.
c24380 +++$+++ What's that?
c03039 +++$+++ That young school teacher... I heard the British hung him as a spy.
c03495 +++$+++ Did I say that?
c11750 +++$+++ Because, I'll take it.
c15295 +++$+++ Wow, you are smart.
c15638 +++$+++ They only took electrical appliances.
c09316 +++$+++ I always meant to ask, what is it that makes you so special? Why is it you have this special rapport with multiple killers? Why you?
c23890 +++$+++ The creature?
c05427 +++$+++ She was being symbolic.  What if she asked you to fly to the moon?
c06030 +++$+++ He's good people, Mr. Reuben. I swear.
c27061 +++$+++ Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
c25249 +++$+++ Yes, there is something wrong. People who want publicity and don't mind how they get it --what risks they make other people run - - what agony and sorrow they bring to other people --
c05516 +++$+++ Then what? My boobs are too big?
c03812 +++$+++ You don't drink?
c04074 +++$+++ Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
c15365 +++$+++ Nobody in town has seen it, so I'm givin' you first crack at my talents.
c13988 +++$+++ Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
c18158 +++$+++ How much beer?
c21319 +++$+++ Nervous?
c08878 +++$+++ Shapiro. Shapiro.
c09030 +++$+++ That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
c19515 +++$+++ I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
c12579 +++$+++ Could I tell him what it's regarding?
c07168 +++$+++ Why would I care where you're going.
c26343 +++$+++ Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
c09747 +++$+++ It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
c04287 +++$+++ Where's Bill?
c03261 +++$+++ Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
c15154 +++$+++ You want me to give up, huh?  Look, Sal's in back with the girls. Anything happens to me - one move - and Sal gives it to them.  Boom boom.  How do I know you won't jump me?
c07141 +++$+++ Yessir, his vehicle. Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he's swapped again for god knows what.
c11458 +++$+++ I order you to find out where we are!
c15956 +++$+++ No
c23607 +++$+++ You'll forget him, Sugar.
c22391 +++$+++ All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
c26264 +++$+++ You want to make a kiddies bet?
c11885 +++$+++ It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
c07750 +++$+++ What's the problem?
c04983 +++$+++ I'm in my underwear.
c12173 +++$+++ Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
c14633 +++$+++ I sincerely doubt it.
c01976 +++$+++ Do too little you'll die.
c07742 +++$+++ What?
c26802 +++$+++ No, this is great.
c01155 +++$+++ Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
c14168 +++$+++ Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, sir. Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.
c08042 +++$+++ No, you can't --
c24388 +++$+++ I haven't done anything, Norma.
c12741 +++$+++ Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
c17798 +++$+++ I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
c04965 +++$+++ Plus the same deal as before.
c17834 +++$+++ That would be a No.
c17959 +++$+++ Reporters don't have hormones?
c20468 +++$+++ When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
c08924 +++$+++ Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
c14469 +++$+++ Really?
c02720 +++$+++ This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
c15210 +++$+++ Fifty cents.
c02806 +++$+++ Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
c17869 +++$+++ Cool off, we're seniors.
c17903 +++$+++ You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
c10962 +++$+++ I'll set John on you!
c19967 +++$+++ Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
c12031 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c12891 +++$+++ Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
c13571 +++$+++ Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
c22591 +++$+++ Can be what?
c09523 +++$+++ I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
c23991 +++$+++ No, that's true.
c10840 +++$+++ Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
c24877 +++$+++ Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
c23273 +++$+++ Rats...
c26054 +++$+++ Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
c07527 +++$+++ You're afraid of him.
c19213 +++$+++ We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in.
c21823 +++$+++ Sixty-five.
c15878 +++$+++ I could get more loyalty if I went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
c25418 +++$+++ I don't know why I come here every evening, it's always such bad news.
c23040 +++$+++ Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
c01555 +++$+++ Does that work?
c18958 +++$+++ Just send me a money order.
c15397 +++$+++ At what point?
c19979 +++$+++ Daddy --
c13519 +++$+++ I was doing my job. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I didn't become the best reporter in the world sitting by the phone. I was chasing tail all night--I was not spying, intentionally, on your hot and heavy date with "Brock Leviathan, architect."  I can't believe he ordered white wine.  You do know white wine is not real wine...
c23759 +++$+++ She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
c07313 +++$+++ Thank you, sir!
c05760 +++$+++ He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
c16378 +++$+++ Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
c20117 +++$+++ Weird shit...?
c07339 +++$+++ And you turned him down??
c23715 +++$+++ Wow, I have a clitoris too.
c25074 +++$+++ Let's not get into any more trouble.
c05439 +++$+++ Go to sleep Ellen.
c10766 +++$+++ I don't like nobody behind my back!
c03776 +++$+++ It's fine!
c10073 +++$+++ I don't buy it.
c17692 +++$+++ Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
c01285 +++$+++ For what?
c21235 +++$+++ But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
c21268 +++$+++ For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
c13410 +++$+++ What? What?!
c15501 +++$+++ And 290 "disregards," right?
c01088 +++$+++ Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
c07595 +++$+++ For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
c24521 +++$+++ But he's never there.
c09930 +++$+++ They're inside --
c25175 +++$+++ Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
c27128 +++$+++ No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
c19847 +++$+++ Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
c25288 +++$+++ Italian? The Mafia...?
c22198 +++$+++ Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
c14400 +++$+++ Where are you, Peter?
c17598 +++$+++ Who's that?
c14976 +++$+++ Fucking women, man...
c05523 +++$+++ Fire moat... why do that?
c20571 +++$+++ But...are you engaged or something?
c22635 +++$+++ I want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
c03171 +++$+++ Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
c07925 +++$+++ Anything else bothering you?
c16693 +++$+++ Forty dollars -- was $250.
c09205 +++$+++ Space?
c21147 +++$+++ And we didn't have to bring another present?
c08955 +++$+++ En route? Why? We weren't expecting you for another three months. Has something happened?  <u>Has something happened</u>? Do you read us?
c10870 +++$+++ But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
c08485 +++$+++ Looks like that's not all they admired.
c00970 +++$+++ I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
c19948 +++$+++ Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
c03032 +++$+++ None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
c12282 +++$+++ Yes. It's a very good show.
c06099 +++$+++ Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
c20418 +++$+++ Please make sure it does not happen again.
c16166 +++$+++ You?  What about me?  I'm working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
c15895 +++$+++ No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
c08841 +++$+++ A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
c02742 +++$+++ You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
c20672 +++$+++ I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
c19496 +++$+++ Quincy...
c12868 +++$+++ Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
c24475 +++$+++ What about you?
c08253 +++$+++ Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet ----	one as a detective.
c04206 +++$+++ Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into.  But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
c16422 +++$+++ I mean it.  Take care of it.
c20834 +++$+++ They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
c11209 +++$+++ Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
c11180 +++$+++ Who's Colson, Harry?
c11146 +++$+++ What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
c06464 +++$+++ Spare us.
c17384 +++$+++ I'll keep in touch.
c14080 +++$+++ You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
c20413 +++$+++ The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
c23782 +++$+++ No, no, that's too far. Try a more gentle stroke. It's all in the stroke. Go ahead, now, honey - stroke. As the camera comes around the side of the whale, we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman.  His back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it.
c19584 +++$+++ If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
c20006 +++$+++ No!
c05069 +++$+++ How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
c03908 +++$+++ WHY?
c12740 +++$+++ Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
c01787 +++$+++ She's done everything I wanted. She bit on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss account...
c18574 +++$+++ Give me back my hat!
c00597 +++$+++ Well, Sire, I made some inquiries in a routine way. I was curious to know why he had so few pupils. It is rather alarming.
c16077 +++$+++ How come?
c16971 +++$+++ Is he coming here?
c20294 +++$+++ I can't. I need my family around me now.
c05871 +++$+++ You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
c24209 +++$+++ He's right.  They must have clobbered some of our cities already.
c00154 +++$+++ Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
c12942 +++$+++ See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way!
c09580 +++$+++ What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
c11143 +++$+++ You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
c22415 +++$+++ Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A.
c02962 +++$+++ Say again?  How many micks?
c24140 +++$+++ Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
c01989 +++$+++ I have to.
c01236 +++$+++ Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
c19308 +++$+++ Well, you were working there--
c24674 +++$+++ Radical.
c10754 +++$+++ Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
c06894 +++$+++ You're going to go see her.
c13144 +++$+++ A half hour in the lobby.
c02293 +++$+++ Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
c11618 +++$+++ I'm gonna get you out of here.
c23891 +++$+++ Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
c27250 +++$+++ Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
c10208 +++$+++ Rudder's left, stick's forward.
c21532 +++$+++ I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.
c05307 +++$+++ They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
c19520 +++$+++ Nona, please.
c12450 +++$+++ And what do you do, sir?
c16020 +++$+++ Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
c10699 +++$+++ Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
c09561 +++$+++ But... Betsy...
c07145 +++$+++ No sir.
c20044 +++$+++ I insist.
c07901 +++$+++ I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
c13534 +++$+++ We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
c17536 +++$+++ Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
c12058 +++$+++ I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates.  But those big boys know how to fight. They could make you look real sissy.  I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  So what's your real name? 'Samo?'
c22704 +++$+++ What?  I'm sorry, talk.
c13461 +++$+++ I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
c02718 +++$+++ Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
c14544 +++$+++ I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.
c09242 +++$+++ We can't let you do that.
c04892 +++$+++ Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
c16254 +++$+++ I don't think so. It's nice.
c11272 +++$+++ Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
c21941 +++$+++ Yes!
c13370 +++$+++ So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
c05913 +++$+++ Ha ha.  No, really.
c04928 +++$+++ And is that it?
c24675 +++$+++ You sure?
c08497 +++$+++ What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
c22214 +++$+++ Cause I don't take Acme Dumb Pills.  I don't know what you're up to, lady, but I'm gonna nail you for the Acme murder.
c26071 +++$+++ On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
c10799 +++$+++ No.
c15203 +++$+++ Ask Sal.
c03723 +++$+++ Dad--
c26134 +++$+++ I still don't believe it.
c12643 +++$+++ There ya go.
c02174 +++$+++ What happened, Doolittle?
c13113 +++$+++ I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
c08341 +++$+++ Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
c11019 +++$+++ Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
c17395 +++$+++ No.
c27152 +++$+++ We have to stick with the plan.
c15975 +++$+++ You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
c02528 +++$+++ Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
c10596 +++$+++ It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
c03870 +++$+++ Look, the ice is melting.
c16527 +++$+++ What?
c00290 +++$+++ Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
c13867 +++$+++ ...seriously.
c01564 +++$+++ I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
c03334 +++$+++ This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
c03991 +++$+++ It's not what I heard.
c19549 +++$+++ You won't.  You won't have to.
c11633 +++$+++ Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
c09906 +++$+++ That's absurd --
c01847 +++$+++ Did it work?
c26563 +++$+++ I could subpoena him if I had a week.
c24097 +++$+++ Yes?
c00255 +++$+++ You noticed..
c21126 +++$+++ So?
c13130 +++$+++ Don't push it, Larry.
c22752 +++$+++ Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
c10849 +++$+++ Of God.
c14163 +++$+++ I don't give a shit, Qualen!  I had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  They beat us.  A couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
c08318 +++$+++ I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
c21797 +++$+++ But how can you be sure?
c21601 +++$+++ Name it.
c17500 +++$+++ When I was first married.
c26600 +++$+++ Me, too.
c03220 +++$+++ Just promise you'll do it.
c00632 +++$+++ Yes.
c01060 +++$+++ I just want to be alone.
c13880 +++$+++ An obituary column... can you read in this light?
c03864 +++$+++ Oh, it's fine. Fine.
c13286 +++$+++ Vampires of the world, beware.
c14957 +++$+++ We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
c25168 +++$+++ We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
c15299 +++$+++ Wait a minute, I think I know who stole it.
c20222 +++$+++ Did they send you...Did they send you?
c17907 +++$+++ No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
c04827 +++$+++ No.
c05036 +++$+++ She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
c03540 +++$+++ Then you know him?
c02796 +++$+++ That would be okay.
c07432 +++$+++ Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
c24247 +++$+++ I will.
c13761 +++$+++ How can you tell?
c25435 +++$+++ I think I'll keep that to myself. Which way are the rooms?
c15425 +++$+++ St. Joseph's.
c07284 +++$+++ Because it ain't natural, young man.
c12074 +++$+++ Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
c17806 +++$+++ ...what?
c25213 +++$+++ Why?
c12045 +++$+++ Can I walk you home?
c14366 +++$+++ Buck is a deal.
c00719 +++$+++ You understand?
c22787 +++$+++ I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
c20174 +++$+++ Yeah. They're in the semis.
c02739 +++$+++ But I'm the one up there on the screen.
c06062 +++$+++ Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
c10667 +++$+++ You mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  Hannah mentioned something about it. About a note.
c13132 +++$+++ You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
c26917 +++$+++ And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
c03578 +++$+++ But, Madam. cannot do that.
c10612 +++$+++ You upset with me?
c17204 +++$+++ Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
c20569 +++$+++ I don't think the color of the interior is....
c04063 +++$+++ Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
c05729 +++$+++ ...their damned souls will be ours.
c19477 +++$+++ How's that been?
c27229 +++$+++ No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
c16459 +++$+++ Most men are.
c25184 +++$+++ What else is there?
c08570 +++$+++ I don't have time for this, Sayer.
c06287 +++$+++ I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
c16575 +++$+++ Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
c22003 +++$+++ Then why does she act so dumb?
c22020 +++$+++ Well, time will tell, won't it?
c26482 +++$+++ I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
c26111 +++$+++ I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
c14996 +++$+++ Linda, what's the matter?
c09142 +++$+++ Not tonight, I have work here.
c06969 +++$+++ The former Duchess!
c23355 +++$+++ No, I couldn't...
c13026 +++$+++ He's tampered with it, Dowser.
c12329 +++$+++ I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
c02853 +++$+++ Philosophical?
c04762 +++$+++ No.
c03154 +++$+++ Goddamit, Dodge.
c25044 +++$+++ -- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
c20723 +++$+++ What...?  0h, yes.
c04988 +++$+++ So what, you left her there.
c00494 +++$+++ I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
c25964 +++$+++ Surely she is older?
c23662 +++$+++ It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
c07676 +++$+++ It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
c22345 +++$+++ What?
c24432 +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me?
c07794 +++$+++ Of course.
c22491 +++$+++ I'm listening.
c13573 +++$+++ It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
c20872 +++$+++ It sounds like you.
c05422 +++$+++ ...And how much is it?
c02087 +++$+++ Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
c04009 +++$+++ What's your problem?  What did I... Why are you --
c13339 +++$+++ I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
c02583 +++$+++ No one's dying on my watch, Smith! What about the reserve tanks?
c12391 +++$+++ That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
c17083 +++$+++ No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
c11330 +++$+++ Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
c13965 +++$+++ She ran away?
c21072 +++$+++ What are they?
c16425 +++$+++ Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
c18472 +++$+++ I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind ---or just because he is one's father?
c20843 +++$+++ Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
c04842 +++$+++ Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
c25973 +++$+++ Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
c13336 +++$+++ It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
c12772 +++$+++ Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
c25790 +++$+++ "Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
c25005 +++$+++ I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
c16486 +++$+++ What's her name?
c18266 +++$+++ Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
c26478 +++$+++ The angel... the angel of death. I'm scared, Ned. Ned, I'm gonna die.
c23360 +++$+++ Did your father take a loan?
c09428 +++$+++ Ba Fa Goulle.
c06671 +++$+++ They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  What do you think about that?
c17343 +++$+++ I told you to cooperate with these people.
c09151 +++$+++ It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
c13114 +++$+++ We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
c18303 +++$+++ Thank you.  But who sits there?
c23176 +++$+++ I just... who what?
c22467 +++$+++ No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run?
c07922 +++$+++ Smart? She'll be arrested!
c09618 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c14757 +++$+++ I don't know.
c21238 +++$+++ You were his what, his box?
c01002 +++$+++ No thanks.
c22897 +++$+++ What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
c07041 +++$+++ No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
c08903 +++$+++ Aye.
c05890 +++$+++ I've already asked them. They're afraid to make the trip. We'll have to send an expedition back after them.
c00317 +++$+++ Yes, but...
c11714 +++$+++ You can't --
c11857 +++$+++ I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
c21452 +++$+++ Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
c23012 +++$+++ His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is Mercutio.
c05143 +++$+++ No...
c03745 +++$+++ Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
c04147 +++$+++ Did you finish the interview?
c11167 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c19161 +++$+++ And if we're unlucky?
c16324 +++$+++ Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
c13712 +++$+++ No.
c25534 +++$+++ Well, let me do that for you.
c03417 +++$+++ Where is the car?
c02937 +++$+++ Come on, Montgomery...
c00666 +++$+++ I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
c15215 +++$+++ I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
c21843 +++$+++ In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
c20480 +++$+++ You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
c24905 +++$+++ All right, I guess.
c24839 +++$+++ Fuck you, Mr. whatever-your-name is. This is a lifestyle I embrace.
c11035 +++$+++ There never was, there'll never be another like you.
c07898 +++$+++ And you're drinking with them right now.
c01818 +++$+++ It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
c25527 +++$+++ I couldn't go near that woman.
c23116 +++$+++ That kid... the hairdresser.
c21863 +++$+++ Yes.  We would!
c25904 +++$+++ What did your wife get her?
c20300 +++$+++ A wife knows.
c14781 +++$+++ I do development for TV movies.
c26508 +++$+++ What?
c16035 +++$+++ A useless talent.
c13433 +++$+++ Don't thank me, just do it. You're the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have to tell you this.
c07087 +++$+++ It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
c23390 +++$+++ Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
c15061 +++$+++ You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
c09733 +++$+++ I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
c07046 +++$+++ I agree it's ridiculous but --
c07670 +++$+++ ... Like Prince Charming.
c06984 +++$+++ Yes. It is unfortunate.
c26857 +++$+++ ...but...
c05793 +++$+++ Too little.
c24197 +++$+++ Where, sir?
c22764 +++$+++ Yeah, okay.
c01918 +++$+++ Everything is quite all right.
c17323 +++$+++ Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
c23359 +++$+++ Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
c27211 +++$+++ I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
c11189 +++$+++ Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
c18317 +++$+++ You didn't drive her mad.
c17062 +++$+++ I talked to Murray and Mitch an hour ago.  They're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
c26921 +++$+++ Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
c01672 +++$+++ Be careful.
c23180 +++$+++ But in the same house, you know, one house.
c09230 +++$+++ Slow down, slow down.
c20623 +++$+++ Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
c26777 +++$+++ Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
c01687 +++$+++ A couple of peons for the mob and...
c09271 +++$+++ Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
c04395 +++$+++ Eggs. How do you like them?
c04069 +++$+++ It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
c16178 +++$+++ Why not?
c23117 +++$+++ That you were just indulging me.
c10972 +++$+++ Well, get started.
c22261 +++$+++ I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
c13581 +++$+++ I still don't see you.
c00785 +++$+++ Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
c01502 +++$+++ Bravo!
c02722 +++$+++ No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
c20973 +++$+++ You abide by rules like that?
c07098 +++$+++ Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
c12153 +++$+++ Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
c05184 +++$+++ Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
c21730 +++$+++ Can I have some chips?
c05686 +++$+++ Reward?
c01743 +++$+++ I hope not.
c02878 +++$+++ I don't have the slightest idea.
c08778 +++$+++ Are you okay?
c03810 +++$+++ You're not a film producer, are you?
c25935 +++$+++ When did you talk to Harry?
c04536 +++$+++ Take a left and your next right.
c24135 +++$+++ You know he hated my story also.
c10711 +++$+++ I'm not sure that's possible.
c11802 +++$+++ But we could go to London and live in England.
c04903 +++$+++ And you didn't tell the Police?
c10896 +++$+++ Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
c22109 +++$+++ Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
c20362 +++$+++ Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
c20557 +++$+++ You are weird. Let's just go.
c18744 +++$+++ Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
c23425 +++$+++ Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
c24435 +++$+++ Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
c17392 +++$+++ You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
c11524 +++$+++ I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
c07683 +++$+++ Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
c07801 +++$+++ Sure you can, just--
c15898 +++$+++ Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
c21398 +++$+++ Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
c08963 +++$+++ We'll beam aboard and stop it --
c09914 +++$+++ It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
c09154 +++$+++ Captain, don't assume he's anything like you are. You should resist the urge to think you know him.
c22978 +++$+++ You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
c06314 +++$+++ Wait a minute . . .
c00302 +++$+++ What other ways are there to get illegal films?  Who do you see?
c10408 +++$+++ I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
c11223 +++$+++ Tonight?
c09495 +++$+++ He's downstairs.
c15857 +++$+++ An Imperial probe droid.
c14100 +++$+++ What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
c24404 +++$+++ Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
c07770 +++$+++ His wife's?
c02747 +++$+++ Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
c09206 +++$+++ I am husband?
c00964 +++$+++ Out and about, doing odds and sods.
c00812 +++$+++ I guess so.
c15981 +++$+++ Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
c07232 +++$+++ Thanks...
c23443 +++$+++ Not an easy book.
c22203 +++$+++ Big on the musical comedy, huh?
c20622 +++$+++ No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
c13898 +++$+++ Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
c26162 +++$+++ You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
c08567 +++$+++ I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
c16941 +++$+++ Gonna knock down a wall?
c15575 +++$+++ Someone else?
c14035 +++$+++ Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
c22700 +++$+++ See you tomorrow.
c10272 +++$+++ I don't need Kuato for that.
c20246 +++$+++ Where exactly is it?
c21039 +++$+++ Yeah, that's kind of crazy, ain't it!
c00243 +++$+++ Uh... at least fifty.
c09067 +++$+++ He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
c03798 +++$+++ What?
c07948 +++$+++ Shut up. I'm all right.
c26140 +++$+++ God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
c08940 +++$+++ Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
c26396 +++$+++ I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
c25883 +++$+++ Can you arrange a meeting?
c05357 +++$+++ Why?
c24732 +++$+++ He's as big as Toscanini, maybe even bigger. In this neck of the woods, he's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one.
c06125 +++$+++ I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
c07904 +++$+++ What time?
c22026 +++$+++ It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
c14303 +++$+++ Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
c04744 +++$+++ Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
c00576 +++$+++ Yes!
c00892 +++$+++ Is that a raincoat?
c17774 +++$+++ For a consideration.
c27235 +++$+++ Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
c16988 +++$+++ Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
c10785 +++$+++ Nothing. It's over.
c26006 +++$+++ No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
c08312 +++$+++ Then why'd you call me?
c20367 +++$+++ Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
c05005 +++$+++ Turn left.
c18801 +++$+++ It doesn't matter what I think.
c19950 +++$+++ -- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
c11468 +++$+++ Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
c05448 +++$+++ They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
c08326 +++$+++ Jesus, I don't know if I can get away. I've got a client waiting. I'd have to do some heavy duty juggling.
c05098 +++$+++ Close the fucking door!
c11530 +++$+++ I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
c05882 +++$+++ There must be some connection between the plane and this place. They must have deliberately brought us here. Why, Bob? What reason could they have for doing a thing like that?
c18678 +++$+++ He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
c23641 +++$+++ Go on...
c00076 +++$+++ How long?
c04282 +++$+++ Open up the trunk.
c02251 +++$+++ I don't even think you have a gun!
c21761 +++$+++ Oh, god, what?
c27086 +++$+++ Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
c13199 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c03640 +++$+++ I don't know, Myra, I never had partners. I never needed them.
c15099 +++$+++ Helps sometimes to say it.
c20590 +++$+++ God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
c13235 +++$+++ Is that what that is?  I never seen any before.  I always thought that stuff was expensive!
c01384 +++$+++ Can I put it in your mouth?
c22053 +++$+++ That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
c24681 +++$+++ Uh-unh, no, it's different... It's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  You get it?
c24527 +++$+++ Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
c06744 +++$+++ You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
c20620 +++$+++ Thank you. Bye.
c21627 +++$+++ Pretty big chance, huh?
c12735 +++$+++ California, huh?
c05341 +++$+++ Sounds very violent.
c05352 +++$+++ I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
c15926 +++$+++ Listen, boy, it's more than twenty days from here.
c14458 +++$+++ Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
c20257 +++$+++ Rita. Pass the wine.
c14791 +++$+++ No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
c24282 +++$+++ No, no, I have to talk to you.
c05925 +++$+++ Why not?
c21292 +++$+++ You goin' right back to work?
c14769 +++$+++ Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was a werewolf, would you believe me?
c18874 +++$+++ Add it to the list.
c00234 +++$+++ ...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
c00458 +++$+++ Sir, the President does not call this particular number. So whoever you are get a life, before I have this call traced.
c04195 +++$+++ I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
c08242 +++$+++ I don't know.
c26420 +++$+++ Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show.
c03687 +++$+++ God ... this can't be true.
c24439 +++$+++ You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
c04742 +++$+++ I might.
c22878 +++$+++ So you better leave.
c25556 +++$+++ You talk as if I were Asta.
c00821 +++$+++ This is no game.
c15867 +++$+++ Has Threepio turned up yet?
c19454 +++$+++ Dad around?
c11024 +++$+++ Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
c18475 +++$+++ You were father's secretary --- I never thought - -
c01527 +++$+++ I thought only hookers drank those things.
c19572 +++$+++ I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
c18438 +++$+++ Yes.
c14457 +++$+++ You were the last one I saw just before the accident. Do you remember? We made love.
c11601 +++$+++ Who knows? Right.
c04869 +++$+++ You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
c25871 +++$+++ Where can I find him?
c13242 +++$+++ Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
c21064 +++$+++ Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
c02313 +++$+++ Relax, that's my ma's code for, "Bring home milk and a carton-a Luckys."
c11092 +++$+++ Let's not get over-dramatic.
c06271 +++$+++ Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
c15891 +++$+++ I thought he was, but he came back.
c03532 +++$+++ I want to be alone.
c02633 +++$+++ I take out the garbage.
c04482 +++$+++ Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
c04124 +++$+++ Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
c25281 +++$+++ Penrhyndeudraeth, North Wales.
c17979 +++$+++ I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
c09842 +++$+++ I'm Michael.
c20052 +++$+++ He tried to..."do business"...with you.  Around ten.  His place.  Be there.
c03583 +++$+++ There was -- there was.
c07189 +++$+++ Another additional.
c08946 +++$+++ Well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. But me: I need some challenge in my life. Some adventure... Even just a surprise or two.
c12303 +++$+++ Well, ain't that the truth...
c09886 +++$+++ Why would you let me go back?
c11701 +++$+++ Ask him.
c06329 +++$+++ Sure, you are.
c17272 +++$+++ I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
c01570 +++$+++ No.  They all do.
c02008 +++$+++ Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
c17119 +++$+++ We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
c05045 +++$+++ They weren't human!
c02283 +++$+++ Follow him where?
c12120 +++$+++ The _Rolls_?
c03286 +++$+++ It hasn't been that simple so far.
c13082 +++$+++ I don't know which numero.
c00156 +++$+++ Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
c24044 +++$+++ We can't shoot the Old Mill.
c01556 +++$+++ And thanks for always being happy!
c07751 +++$+++ No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
c26075 +++$+++ Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
c27280 +++$+++ I'm well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
c15428 +++$+++ And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
c16498 +++$+++ You know what, you are never satisfied.
c10144 +++$+++ The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
c09136 +++$+++ And if they're still in place?
c27289 +++$+++ I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King's daughter.
c17697 +++$+++ How do you know?
c05040 +++$+++ Jezzie, I can't see.
c15194 +++$+++ Something is going down. Something bad.
c21927 +++$+++ Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
c23936 +++$+++ What ?
c11671 +++$+++ To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
c20708 +++$+++ No.
c10422 +++$+++ A single hour.
c22132 +++$+++ I should leave.
c17911 +++$+++ Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
c16356 +++$+++ I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
c14951 +++$+++ This play?
c18367 +++$+++ Great, thanks for the tip.
c07224 +++$+++ I gotta go.
c16233 +++$+++ It's only for an hour --
c21212 +++$+++ Maybe I will-- one of these days.
c06786 +++$+++ Or Batman --
c27401 +++$+++ What?
c05974 +++$+++ Sean, wait...
c07968 +++$+++ Are you going down there?
c08203 +++$+++ Who's voice was it, Dottie?
c25933 +++$+++ Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
c16897 +++$+++ Where are you going?
c24760 +++$+++ I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
c14150 +++$+++ For the same reason you did, to help.
c10703 +++$+++ What's he doing out there?
c19198 +++$+++ It's hit us all hard!
c19345 +++$+++ Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
c25808 +++$+++ Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
c03491 +++$+++ That's enough.
c26457 +++$+++ In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
c07972 +++$+++ He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
c07315 +++$+++ Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
c16537 +++$+++ It is true.
c01411 +++$+++ Don't know if God wanna see me.
c10380 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mom.
c02736 +++$+++ Excuse me, sir?
c05866 +++$+++ That's very convenient. I think I'd like that.
c05662 +++$+++ That's the problem.
c20094 +++$+++ Get lost.
c15351 +++$+++ Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
c01524 +++$+++ Stop that ma'am crap!
c20731 +++$+++ Do you study at all?
c25999 +++$+++ So go shower already.
c16487 +++$+++ I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
c23790 +++$+++ What's plan C?
c10867 +++$+++ You're a mistake.
c21972 +++$+++ But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
c00684 +++$+++ Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
c25180 +++$+++ Congratulations.
c00702 +++$+++ Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
c03800 +++$+++ ...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
c22367 +++$+++ You think he skipped town?
c25401 +++$+++ Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
c27366 +++$+++ Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
c17381 +++$+++ The wrench, why?
c18964 +++$+++ No.
c25399 +++$+++ He never says his name.
c25674 +++$+++ What about the ballistics report?
c18740 +++$+++ You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
c22473 +++$+++ About her upcoming wedding and all.
c23533 +++$+++ I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
c21916 +++$+++ Am I that close to Fairvale?
c01830 +++$+++ With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
c17191 +++$+++ Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
c20897 +++$+++ Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
c07045 +++$+++ Uh huh ...
c07915 +++$+++ Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
c18593 +++$+++ Honey, I gotta go.
c10149 +++$+++ Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
c12190 +++$+++ It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
c05782 +++$+++ Are you sure?
c21990 +++$+++ Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
c27232 +++$+++ Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
c16188 +++$+++ Please. Let's just go have a cup of coffee. That's all I'm asking for. I'm sure there's another flight to Paris tonight.
c20749 +++$+++ Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
c06873 +++$+++ Ah.
c12394 +++$+++ Yeah, I saw them
c22414 +++$+++ A little Mu-shu.
c00500 +++$+++ Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
c22177 +++$+++ Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
c25214 +++$+++ No Sir, the hotel is full because of the Diving championship.
c09149 +++$+++ Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
c11595 +++$+++ Who's he?
c04276 +++$+++ Hopefully I can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home... yes, Dad I'm kidding.
c03567 +++$+++ A thousand marks --
c23222 +++$+++ -- Yeah, honey...
c09757 +++$+++ What did they give you?
c14863 +++$+++ The government
c14966 +++$+++ So...If the hull's impregnable why are my feet wet?
c20226 +++$+++ Is this the only way?
c04043 +++$+++ Who the fuck's Pig?
c10485 +++$+++ Guess so.
c26014 +++$+++ I want your money, I'll take your money.
c11194 +++$+++ I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you.  I was interested.
c20860 +++$+++ Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
c01484 +++$+++ It would be my child.
c16804 +++$+++ But Rennie...
c17209 +++$+++ What happened?
c18698 +++$+++ We're going.
c14591 +++$+++ Never!
c04067 +++$+++ Well call her mother.
c23419 +++$+++ I ain't got no boy.
c12079 +++$+++ My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
c01075 +++$+++ It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
c20189 +++$+++ Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
c08905 +++$+++ What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
c24656 +++$+++ We're old friends, Chickie - quit it!  A big columnist comes in this room, without his ball-and-chain and you make like a delicatessen counter!  What did you think would happen in his house?
c04923 +++$+++ Right around here, in the food court.
c02998 +++$+++ No I didn't.
c00828 +++$+++ This is Dorsia?
c01474 +++$+++ Thank you very much.
c21423 +++$+++ Allright. Calm down.
c14153 +++$+++ If you're not using your arm, can I borrow it?
c08256 +++$+++ A book of successful verse might have changed that, eh?
c25700 +++$+++ Gaston Monescu.
c00491 +++$+++ Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
c04682 +++$+++ Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
c11896 +++$+++ Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
c10258 +++$+++ Do what?
c14526 +++$+++ I thought you wanted Zammito?
c01620 +++$+++ Sometimes I think I do.
c01056 +++$+++ Why?
c27331 +++$+++ Jon??  You mean he's --
c25817 +++$+++ Why?
c05877 +++$+++ But to be candid, Father, a prolonged future doesn't excite me. It would have to have a point. I've sometimes doubted whether life itself has any. And if that is so, then long life must be even more pointless. No, I'd need a much more definite reason for going on and on.
c17593 +++$+++ Just one moment.
c13549 +++$+++ I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
c02227 +++$+++ Okay, okay, okay--
c25596 +++$+++ Where the hell is it!?
c01450 +++$+++ He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
c13010 +++$+++ xxxxxx
c01810 +++$+++ So...
c10977 +++$+++ Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
c24461 +++$+++ So where is all them half-centses?
c12985 +++$+++ No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
c01507 +++$+++ No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
c07627 +++$+++ And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
c22374 +++$+++ I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
c25482 +++$+++ Then why the rat?
c07066 +++$+++ Fucking hell.
c00942 +++$+++ I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
c05329 +++$+++ Through a rental agency.
c15886 +++$+++ Good God.
c00145 +++$+++ Yeah?  What kind?
c07199 +++$+++ ...I meant your food.
c04872 +++$+++ That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
c19217 +++$+++ And the weed?
c12492 +++$+++ Is this your homework, Larry?
c20331 +++$+++ I move for no man.
c04891 +++$+++ That's all you've had all this time?
c16803 +++$+++ What about you?
c20505 +++$+++ I didn't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new "Park".
c13526 +++$+++ I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
c14519 +++$+++ I'm glad you're doing well.
c18249 +++$+++ Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
c11879 +++$+++ Oh, right, right...
c07405 +++$+++ From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
c21614 +++$+++ You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
c21012 +++$+++ No, don't think I do.
c17610 +++$+++ Who you calling?
c07917 +++$+++ What'll you do if one of them catches you?
c03663 +++$+++ The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
c15576 +++$+++ I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
c24011 +++$+++ And you go start with <u>that</u> stuff in <u>this</u> town...
c24168 +++$+++ I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
c20721 +++$+++ Oh.
c21561 +++$+++ I'm supposing.
c10951 +++$+++ Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
c13300 +++$+++ God, I never thought of that.
c09615 +++$+++ Exactly.  And he got good.
c21035 +++$+++ Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
c05838 +++$+++ Whatiya mean?
c09146 +++$+++ Ready, Captain.
c19642 +++$+++ But --
c00019 +++$+++ Why not?
c16509 +++$+++ What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
c02441 +++$+++ Aaagh! Rape!
c21203 +++$+++ I'll bring him up to your loft.
c09007 +++$+++ We don't want to be any trouble.
c18791 +++$+++ You think they could talk to each other?
c25741 +++$+++ What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
c14915 +++$+++ Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
c03656 +++$+++ My god...
c15104 +++$+++ Now that's the way to talk, Son! I know you worked hard for that crop. But we'll make out.
c00780 +++$+++ I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
c14947 +++$+++ No?  What do you mean 'no'?
c00626 +++$+++ Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
c24598 +++$+++ It's like a song.
c06475 +++$+++ He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
c16112 +++$+++ Or reactivated the first one.
c22900 +++$+++ So where are you?
c05717 +++$+++ They gave me life, mama.
c06575 +++$+++ Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
c20271 +++$+++ When you get engaged?
c17703 +++$+++ So you met somebody else?
c20976 +++$+++ I don't know, I'm afraid.
c13928 +++$+++ You didn't tell me.
c21570 +++$+++ You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
c16458 +++$+++ That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
c05996 +++$+++ That was our apartment.
c18052 +++$+++ Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
c08543 +++$+++ Of course.  What are you suggesting?
c06622 +++$+++ Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
c07975 +++$+++ My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
c10650 +++$+++ There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
c15171 +++$+++ We won't have to.
c03253 +++$+++ Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
c06353 +++$+++ I won't get away with it.
c24902 +++$+++ Right! Strictly business.
c12018 +++$+++ I told you to stay away from Tramell.
c11630 +++$+++ Well who the hell verifies that ?
c05834 +++$+++ Who is this?
c16404 +++$+++ Robert Paulson?
c22727 +++$+++ Okay, bye.
c01141 +++$+++ He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
c14344 +++$+++ 'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
c12044 +++$+++ Drugs??!
c16132 +++$+++ You mean like ... condoms?
c20906 +++$+++ I-
c10426 +++$+++ Listen to me, fella...
c00834 +++$+++ Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
c03849 +++$+++ No.
c01785 +++$+++ No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?
c12918 +++$+++ Where is it?
c11445 +++$+++ So how much do you hate her?
c07156 +++$+++ Llewelyn!
c25955 +++$+++ I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
c10638 +++$+++ Mm.
c20308 +++$+++ That's incredible.
c17699 +++$+++ Hmm?
c02947 +++$+++ Jordan.  You watch your ass.
c17237 +++$+++ Get out --
c16728 +++$+++ Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
c01068 +++$+++ If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
c09333 +++$+++ You mean --
c18659 +++$+++ It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
c25163 +++$+++ How?
c23588 +++$+++ Well, I'm not.
c06411 +++$+++ A hotel?
c22918 +++$+++ How's that?
c17300 +++$+++ Who's gonna do that?
c27212 +++$+++ Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
c21682 +++$+++ Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
c23581 +++$+++ Oh.
c15391 +++$+++ You know, to make the legs move --
c12306 +++$+++ Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
c22290 +++$+++ I wanted to see who you were.
c16653 +++$+++ Who cares?  I got a case.
c05193 +++$+++ Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
c11634 +++$+++ How did she..?
c09734 +++$+++ What?
c18717 +++$+++ Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
c03978 +++$+++ I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
c22324 +++$+++ Not bad enough to kill him.
c11399 +++$+++ Anytime, sport.
c02114 +++$+++ Then what?
c06235 +++$+++ No, I'm not kidding.
c22123 +++$+++ "Transylvania"
c18733 +++$+++ Why?
c10027 +++$+++ It'd have to be pretty good.
c21232 +++$+++ Aannnnaahhnn.
c03037 +++$+++ We've got powder but no ball!
c04185 +++$+++ In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
c21836 +++$+++ Yeah, an hour.
c12458 +++$+++ "Johnson"?
c05243 +++$+++ I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
c06821 +++$+++ She must have been in love with you.
c12773 +++$+++ No -- but I can get it for you.
c05585 +++$+++ Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
c23373 +++$+++ The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
c26632 +++$+++ Oh... wandering about.
c13815 +++$+++ What?
c15178 +++$+++ No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
c08123 +++$+++ You can't leave us here.
c00044 +++$+++ BIANCA
c15072 +++$+++ Yes, I wanted to get here before the others.... I want to talk to you alone.
c15644 +++$+++ What does that have to do with you?
c19150 +++$+++ You know I can't make that promise.
c05221 +++$+++ ...Janitor's job.
c20957 +++$+++ That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
c15327 +++$+++ We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
c04500 +++$+++ And why were you trying to kill me?
c19357 +++$+++ I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
c11906 +++$+++ Is that all there is to it?
c27145 +++$+++ Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
c16180 +++$+++ This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
c04458 +++$+++ Dick-weed.
c22054 +++$+++ Oh, Mother, cut it out.
c16694 +++$+++ For garbage?
c03594 +++$+++ I never fucked up before, Bobo.
c23629 +++$+++ And you thought I'd respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
c17603 +++$+++ What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
c22600 +++$+++ You know I don't think that.
c26884 +++$+++ Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll still be here.
c18321 +++$+++ But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
c11732 +++$+++ About?
c03446 +++$+++ Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
c05655 +++$+++ It sounded like a pick-up line.
c11199 +++$+++ I know.  Salt and pepper?
c24127 +++$+++ This is work.
c09993 +++$+++ Am I in trouble?
c21519 +++$+++ That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
c02721 +++$+++ Your parents of relation?
c26866 +++$+++ Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
c13271 +++$+++ To bring you... your birthright.
c11179 +++$+++ You can't believe that.
c02136 +++$+++ I put them on together.
c21456 +++$+++ Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
c26793 +++$+++ I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
c14495 +++$+++ So, it's over?
c16309 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mike.
c07592 +++$+++ A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
c08448 +++$+++ Well, nice to see you now.
c10171 +++$+++ What the fuck, man? What do you people want? I did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
c19704 +++$+++ You look all right now.
c14444 +++$+++ I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
c15436 +++$+++ I've got news for you-- I never intended to marry him.
c09051 +++$+++ Won't he rust?
c01747 +++$+++ Well, because you guys don't look alike.
c06636 +++$+++ Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
c02218 +++$+++ I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
c25153 +++$+++ So what Jew would you kill first?
c04321 +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
c14225 +++$+++ Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
c25089 +++$+++ I tell you I heard him running ahead of me.
c09138 +++$+++ I do not understand.
c02456 +++$+++ Can't make enough axe-heads!
c20667 +++$+++ If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
c05310 +++$+++ What scars?
c11242 +++$+++ Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
c10342 +++$+++ Can you tell me what their names were?
c01809 +++$+++ But we were so careful.
c19774 +++$+++ Don't worry!  The kids will love it --
c09499 +++$+++ No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
c06757 +++$+++ You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
c10628 +++$+++ That's just another part of the price to pay.
c03068 +++$+++ And 'others', say... have you even read Locke, Vattel, Voltaire, Diderot...
c09021 +++$+++ You've programmed that from memory...?
c15850 +++$+++ The temperature is dropping too fast.
c06373 +++$+++ How much you wanna bet?
c13698 +++$+++ Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
c11336 +++$+++ yes, we had, uh...
c22286 +++$+++ It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
c24832 +++$+++ A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
c14282 +++$+++ You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
c13735 +++$+++ Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
c17275 +++$+++ No ... ?
c08309 +++$+++ Why, so you can go after him?
c25052 +++$+++ And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
c23847 +++$+++ Bingo.
c17309 +++$+++ But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
c24288 +++$+++ Now?
c04706 +++$+++ You were going to have this thug...?
c26622 +++$+++ You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
c05486 +++$+++ Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
c12885 +++$+++ What do you want me to say?
c00010 +++$+++ Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
c22431 +++$+++ I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
c00640 +++$+++ I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
c22160 +++$+++ Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
c25639 +++$+++ I'll try.
c10042 +++$+++ And you think he could find out her number for me?
c19632 +++$+++ No, M'lady.
c20681 +++$+++ He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
c23987 +++$+++ What've you got?
c21211 +++$+++ Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
c16046 +++$+++ Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
c13364 +++$+++ Right back.
c04775 +++$+++ Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
c01699 +++$+++ Just be natural, goddamit.
c07545 +++$+++ Argon's private lab.
c27254 +++$+++ Lions and tigers and bears!
c22698 +++$+++ What's a scam?
c19655 +++$+++ Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
c15872 +++$+++ No.
c01716 +++$+++ Inez, this is --
c02213 +++$+++ You're crazy.
c15466 +++$+++ What does that have to do with... ?
c10825 +++$+++ Have you ever been in love?
c10443 +++$+++ No, no, no. I have to talk to him. If I can only call him...
c09060 +++$+++ It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
c26259 +++$+++ What?  What did you say?
c17842 +++$+++ Gee, thanks.
c07732 +++$+++ YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
c11184 +++$+++ When so ordered.
c21992 +++$+++ What was your mother like?
c18067 +++$+++ Give up.
c08523 +++$+++ -- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
c18401 +++$+++ Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
c21625 +++$+++ Right. A clean deduction from observed facts. They've got to be simple once in a while, Inspector.
c03042 +++$+++ George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
c03147 +++$+++ Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
c26645 +++$+++ Yes?! But --
c20011 +++$+++ Well, that's me.
c20088 +++$+++ Hell, don't cry about it!
c04699 +++$+++ Miles.
c21940 +++$+++ Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
c14766 +++$+++ It's just as well. I'm afraid of getting hurt again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don't want to get too attached to Peter and then find out he's a creep.
c01333 +++$+++ I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
c06673 +++$+++ Doubtful. What did he say?
c06706 +++$+++ ...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
c15145 +++$+++ It looks like a whole roast.
c05639 +++$+++ I still don't know what that means.
c22410 +++$+++ Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
c00965 +++$+++ No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
c11609 +++$+++ Lance Johnson? The surfer?
c09774 +++$+++ The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
c02147 +++$+++ I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
c13640 +++$+++ Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
c09165 +++$+++ Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
c01600 +++$+++ Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
c21552 +++$+++ You WHAT? Say 'gain.
c03109 +++$+++ What do you get out of this?
c09751 +++$+++ Aye --
c25356 +++$+++ But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
c00976 +++$+++ Really? Are they ill-tempered?
c07974 +++$+++ What?
c26586 +++$+++ That's right.
c08263 +++$+++ I didn't know.
c01123 +++$+++ -- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
c03203 +++$+++ Yeah, well --
c18347 +++$+++ -- 73
c00543 +++$+++ That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
c04141 +++$+++ Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
c05977 +++$+++ You're talking about the precogs...
c12686 +++$+++ I see.  How much?
c08356 +++$+++ Dentonvale has been sold.
c13355 +++$+++ Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
c14520 +++$+++ Office work?
c22757 +++$+++ There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
c26074 +++$+++ Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
c04925 +++$+++ You're avoiding the question.
c09489 +++$+++ She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient.
c21883 +++$+++ Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
c02378 +++$+++ But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
c00727 +++$+++ Well, you can. You always could.
c13741 +++$+++ No -- in my room.
c08566 +++$+++ There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
c25269 +++$+++ The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
c21986 +++$+++ Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
c13596 +++$+++ She's not a girl, Col --
c17556 +++$+++ You shut up, stupid!
c02506 +++$+++ What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
c05209 +++$+++ Not so good. You sure you have to?
c18630 +++$+++ Take it up.
c17652 +++$+++ I've given them his profile.
c20686 +++$+++ You have to what?
c10794 +++$+++ I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
c25816 +++$+++ Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
c14877 +++$+++ Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
c13720 +++$+++ Whitefoot, of course.
c00456 +++$+++ No good. I said they disabled the communications system.
c19836 +++$+++ And say what?
c13256 +++$+++ You want some water or something?
c05675 +++$+++ Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
c01218 +++$+++ It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
c00022 +++$+++ Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
c01118 +++$+++ Firehouse.
c07782 +++$+++ What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
c27185 +++$+++ Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
c20737 +++$+++ Oh, why thank you.
c05091 +++$+++ I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
c23466 +++$+++ For keeps.
c09370 +++$+++ You have to lay it on the table.
c25826 +++$+++ Yes, very.  And very married.
c14745 +++$+++ Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
c19446 +++$+++ That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
c05434 +++$+++ What it is -- is the truth.
c15317 +++$+++ No.
c23090 +++$+++ What?
c06015 +++$+++ No coke tonight.  Right?
c07153 +++$+++ Well I didn't see it.
c10943 +++$+++ Oh, they seem all right to me.
c07834 +++$+++ How?
c24783 +++$+++ Stop it!
c10228 +++$+++ That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
c02959 +++$+++ I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
c05564 +++$+++ She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
c16734 +++$+++ What?
c12012 +++$+++ I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
c13512 +++$+++ Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
c10637 +++$+++ Oh. We're picking her up. Downtown.
c13150 +++$+++ Yes.
c01235 +++$+++ Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
c11590 +++$+++ A year ? Waiter another beer.
c25266 +++$+++ Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
c10953 +++$+++ What?
c25360 +++$+++ The English??
c20696 +++$+++ D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
c26900 +++$+++ My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
c12439 +++$+++ The?  Who the fff--
c27330 +++$+++ Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
c02765 +++$+++ Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
c04465 +++$+++ All my life!
c23831 +++$+++ What sub?
c08513 +++$+++ What's she got to do with it?
c18138 +++$+++ How much?
c23196 +++$+++ What did you say?
c01781 +++$+++ Why did he go that way?
c10100 +++$+++ Oh, are you on the team?
c20349 +++$+++ What is the capital of Assyria?
c04760 +++$+++ Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
c03267 +++$+++ How can you be so sure?
c18857 +++$+++ I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
c25289 +++$+++ Then find another way.
c05277 +++$+++ Hello?
c10723 +++$+++ It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
c06123 +++$+++ What do you want me to do?
c26220 +++$+++ 'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
c22349 +++$+++ Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
c02222 +++$+++ Probably a touch of what's going around.
c11958 +++$+++ Are you sure -
c25427 +++$+++ Ohhh I've never been there.
c07397 +++$+++ You know it. Stay Black...
c13151 +++$+++ Did you bring your grey suit?
c09259 +++$+++ Top ten.
c03627 +++$+++ I don't see why not.
c25043 +++$+++ I don't have his number.
c02530 +++$+++ Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
c11612 +++$+++ It's still pretty hairy, sir.
c09726 +++$+++ Aye.
c19887 +++$+++ The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
c04327 +++$+++ You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
c20821 +++$+++ Who is?!
c10506 +++$+++ Do you let your child watch your movies?
c09683 +++$+++ I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
c20267 +++$+++ What's wrong can never be made right.
c15056 +++$+++ They always are.
c07365 +++$+++ When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
c24666 +++$+++ Yes, but why?
c26069 +++$+++ This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
c07139 +++$+++ I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
c10975 +++$+++ It's monstrous -- it grew, like some horrible tapeworm.  We were completely unprepared.
c26750 +++$+++ Evil.
c02023 +++$+++ Mr. Rose *knows*?
c13865 +++$+++ ...Mason?
c21036 +++$+++ Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
c04304 +++$+++ It's true. I wouldn't lie.
c04131 +++$+++ And if I refuse?
c13225 +++$+++ Well I was uh, just looking...
c04212 +++$+++ None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
c17675 +++$+++ Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
c00192 +++$+++ I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
c15140 +++$+++ Don't let 'em off the ground.
c12539 +++$+++ Inside the grave?
c20050 +++$+++ When?
c14641 +++$+++ Okay.
c19688 +++$+++ Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
c14461 +++$+++ What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
c19984 +++$+++ That's it?
c26047 +++$+++ Yeah, Beautifully fucking illustrated.
c05059 +++$+++ Where have they gone?
c14828 +++$+++ The city.  I need to get to the ocean.
c11952 +++$+++ Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting you again. I heard you walking around in here.  Figured I'd drop by.
c11262 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c12681 +++$+++ You happy, baby?
c02968 +++$+++ Yeah. Why are you asking?
c15527 +++$+++ Of course...
c13311 +++$+++ Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
c19839 +++$+++ I know but let's hear it anyway.
c05215 +++$+++ ...just like that?
c11731 +++$+++ Where is it?
c08229 +++$+++ I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
c03521 +++$+++ Time's getting short.
c13156 +++$+++ How?
c12585 +++$+++ Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
c24075 +++$+++ June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
c17125 +++$+++ The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
c23242 +++$+++ Yeah, I guess so.  Anyway, there's hardly anybody to play with around here.
c00395 +++$+++ Yeah. A few things.
c09573 +++$+++ Yeah. From the likes of them.
c13006 +++$+++ See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
c05043 +++$+++ I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
c12478 +++$+++ Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
c08110 +++$+++ You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
c24458 +++$+++ Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've already got a lunch date. With Mr. White's new secretary.
c25521 +++$+++ Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
c00838 +++$+++ You're inhuman.
c23531 +++$+++ You're welcome.
c12543 +++$+++ You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
c00316 +++$+++ I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
c17612 +++$+++ Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
c19007 +++$+++ Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
c13436 +++$+++ This is not the way to treat people.
c04445 +++$+++ You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
c08686 +++$+++ Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
c08746 +++$+++ Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
c01152 +++$+++ Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
c00239 +++$+++ When is she not in trouble?
c05854 +++$+++ Yes.
c08081 +++$+++ I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
c12662 +++$+++ Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
c09942 +++$+++ I didn't. [Beat] Did you have anything to do with his death?
c12406 +++$+++ What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
c22133 +++$+++ ...What?
c08455 +++$+++ See you over there, Miles.
c08551 +++$+++ For her?
c26704 +++$+++ That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
c09685 +++$+++ He's not home.
c13587 +++$+++ Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
c03138 +++$+++ I mean morally. Murray was my friend.
c12499 +++$+++ So no funny stuff.  Okay?
c05454 +++$+++ In a hospital.
c07818 +++$+++ Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
c11668 +++$+++ Oh, please...
c13137 +++$+++ No.  Don't worry about it.
c23190 +++$+++ Television or movies?
c05148 +++$+++ I can't grow a moustache. It never comes in evenly.
c23339 +++$+++ I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
c26310 +++$+++ I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
c08015 +++$+++ Must have a way with stationery.
c06648 +++$+++ Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
c11268 +++$+++ Please, if you'd just listen...
c06797 +++$+++ I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
c16096 +++$+++ Look, if you want to leave...
c19031 +++$+++ The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
c26572 +++$+++ You're going to stay here...?
c13057 +++$+++ Turn!
c24792 +++$+++ What's this all about, Connie?
c15288 +++$+++ Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
c09811 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c07277 +++$+++ It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
c25785 +++$+++ I'll go with you.
c17114 +++$+++ Tom is right.
c12982 +++$+++ Sure you're going to be okay?  I mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
c10698 +++$+++ I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
c23549 +++$+++ I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
c27275 +++$+++ -- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
c01053 +++$+++ That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
c00103 +++$+++ Tomorrow.  At lunch.
c24501 +++$+++ It's beautiful.
c06507 +++$+++ Mother!
c22919 +++$+++ Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
c18400 +++$+++ I suppose.
c26079 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c01064 +++$+++ No, Brett, I...
c10238 +++$+++ How'd you find me?
c21788 +++$+++ The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.
c12001 +++$+++ You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
c17073 +++$+++ John: John:...my daughter...
c10894 +++$+++ ... Thank you.
c15097 +++$+++ Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
c06447 +++$+++ Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
c14645 +++$+++ Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
c04486 +++$+++ You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
c05484 +++$+++ That's not what's important.
c11864 +++$+++ For the inner satisfaction it will bring.  Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
c19102 +++$+++ I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
c20814 +++$+++ What 'you signifyin'?
c20209 +++$+++ Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.
c15509 +++$+++ Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
c27379 +++$+++ You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
c19269 +++$+++ You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
c05322 +++$+++ I'd say at least eighteen hours.
c22343 +++$+++ Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
c22845 +++$+++ God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
c07976 +++$+++ O.K.  G'night.  I got to pick up my scooter.  See you tomorrow.
c10316 +++$+++ I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
c05316 +++$+++ That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
c15524 +++$+++ It all keeps coming back to Dudley.
c19497 +++$+++ I've been trying to find you all day.
c13265 +++$+++ I'm glad you came.
c07845 +++$+++ You're lying to me.
c17814 +++$+++ ...what a lovely perfume.
c21484 +++$+++ Possibly.
c00420 +++$+++ CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
c02402 +++$+++ Well, that's alright. I understand you. Now, say the whole thing again, Hello ...
c01344 +++$+++ Tell me what he said.
c12973 +++$+++ What happened?
c18007 +++$+++ You don't understand.  About seven years ago we found the body of a guy named Vasilnic in Jersey.  A week later in the parking lot of Madison Square Garden we found Iman Fasil. Three days after that Luman Castageer was found in an alley.  The fourth body we've never been able to identify.  All four men died from decapitation.  Nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
c09382 +++$+++ What do you have? A Pluto call back?
c02671 +++$+++ I want romance.
c22001 +++$+++ He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
c08789 +++$+++ Why?
c22711 +++$+++ Okay, I give up.
c10427 +++$+++ Damn right I'm done. I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
c20979 +++$+++ I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
c02384 +++$+++ So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
c04717 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c13498 +++$+++ There's a nice cafe down the street...unless you're afraid of this Catwoman prowling around. We can always dine at the mansion, if..
c16943 +++$+++ I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
c03504 +++$+++ Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
c21050 +++$+++ What?
c03679 +++$+++ But the dance is in the gymnasium.
c08538 +++$+++ I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
c16208 +++$+++ What?  No.  I'm trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms.
c18912 +++$+++ But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
c10521 +++$+++ Why then.
c05018 +++$+++ I'm too messed up to teach.
c24174 +++$+++ I have your word, Mister President?
c24660 +++$+++ That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
c20637 +++$+++ I will I promise.
c11898 +++$+++ Yeah? Why not?
c22983 +++$+++ I mean the armchair!
c13438 +++$+++ So, you're a righty?
c11299 +++$+++ Fifteen years, yeah.
c11976 +++$+++ Yes.
c09305 +++$+++ You're a... you're sick.
c22924 +++$+++ Who are you?  What are you doing out here?
c11316 +++$+++ Let's just do it, all right?
c26238 +++$+++ You're sure?
c19055 +++$+++ You, kill me?
c10922 +++$+++ We'd be thrown out.
c19957 +++$+++ You should hope quite a while.
c21446 +++$+++ In some situations.
c14401 +++$+++ You know I can't do that.
c25014 +++$+++ No, they don't.
c01546 +++$+++ ...the pipe tobacco.
c15495 +++$+++ points at the motel.
c04593 +++$+++ What?
c13067 +++$+++ Of course, of course. Leave it to me. How do I authorize a cheque?
c00975 +++$+++ It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
c05300 +++$+++ How?
c07933 +++$+++ How can you tell that -- from here?
c17786 +++$+++ And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
c16724 +++$+++ Whatta we do now?
c07710 +++$+++ That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
c14067 +++$+++ The quest isn't going well?
c03069 +++$+++ You're kidding me, right?
c08638 +++$+++ He wants me, Bill! I'm going to get him to take me to him! See if you can follow me, and kill him!
c16567 +++$+++ Nineteen.
c15568 +++$+++ Around.
c10992 +++$+++ They're on the next level up.
c08972 +++$+++ Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
c11848 +++$+++ Belinda's a very jealous person.
c18622 +++$+++ Should be coming out of it soon.
c08790 +++$+++ Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
c26486 +++$+++ Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
c14069 +++$+++ Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
c03361 +++$+++ Thank you for coming.  I'd appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
c10226 +++$+++ So have I.
c25767 +++$+++ I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
c11359 +++$+++ Just give me the license, please.
c19187 +++$+++ ...I'd really have to show it to you.
c18183 +++$+++ I'll take my chances.
c20887 +++$+++ Anita!
c09896 +++$+++ You know I can't.
c07789 +++$+++ A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
c26498 +++$+++ I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
c15167 +++$+++ Do you remember anything else about Sal?
c06152 +++$+++ You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
c10105 +++$+++ Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
c12019 +++$+++ Yes I did.
c17999 +++$+++ What did the thermometer say?
c24612 +++$+++ I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
c12330 +++$+++ Good. Anything else?
c19829 +++$+++ Why?
c25559 +++$+++ Why, I believe the little woman cares.
c18157 +++$+++ You have taken business class?
c09273 +++$+++ Yeah, but that was for love.
c19009 +++$+++ Three months.  How can you tell?
c18073 +++$+++ If things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
c22267 +++$+++ And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
c15599 +++$+++ Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
c20476 +++$+++ Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
c15313 +++$+++ Why do they come?
c02737 +++$+++ Oh. I mean, good.
c09773 +++$+++ Please. Come inside.
c08658 +++$+++ I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
c09638 +++$+++ Take a hike.  Am-scray.
c02144 +++$+++ She's not in the gaming business is she?
c26664 +++$+++ Around.
c17326 +++$+++ Oh...
c20742 +++$+++ By all means, knock yourself out.
c05960 +++$+++ What?
c14671 +++$+++ Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
c18331 +++$+++ I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
c13494 +++$+++ That's enough.
c09367 +++$+++ ...and even then...
c17982 +++$+++ Honey --
c03982 +++$+++ O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
c15138 +++$+++ He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling!
c02299 +++$+++ How did this happen?
c14133 +++$+++ Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
c25479 +++$+++ I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
c19917 +++$+++ -- Can't seem to escape you today.
c12677 +++$+++ On the plane.
c15873 +++$+++ That wasn't the bargain.  You said the Empire wouldn't interfere in--
c12025 +++$+++ I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
c22753 +++$+++ We're full on bonded.
c01270 +++$+++ You're a good soldier, Bill.
c11160 +++$+++ It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
c00545 +++$+++ Corporal Hicks!?
c22819 +++$+++ She's not here right now.
c20913 +++$+++ Wow. You believe in me that much--
c22903 +++$+++ I thought Blockbuster fired you.
c16281 +++$+++ I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
c07870 +++$+++ Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
c18665 +++$+++ All or nothing.  You want to roll them for me?
c24181 +++$+++ Get a grip on yourself, Major!
c01927 +++$+++ -- Is what?
c08017 +++$+++ Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
c20154 +++$+++ I said that?
c09017 +++$+++ I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
c23257 +++$+++ Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
c22947 +++$+++ We'll take a look at him.  Talk to him.
c16475 +++$+++ Yes... I... I agree...
c04121 +++$+++ But Ian, he's still but a boy.
c15243 +++$+++ I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
c09658 +++$+++ Yes.
c24350 +++$+++ It's just impossible.
c17057 +++$+++ I will close.
c14688 +++$+++ Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
c09677 +++$+++ Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
c03399 +++$+++ He killed his father and then my family...
c02557 +++$+++ Coffee.
c09213 +++$+++ Yes.
c10562 +++$+++ Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
c17172 +++$+++ No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
c10515 +++$+++ Well, that's all part of it.
c21954 +++$+++ It happens that I'm the law.
c02984 +++$+++ No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
c05555 +++$+++ Why not mine the damned walls?
c14895 +++$+++ We ran up against a platoon of soldiers. There were actually walking dead...in uniform...with guns.
c19404 +++$+++ I don't think so.
c08369 +++$+++ I NEED SOME
c21273 +++$+++ Bleeding on a country road.
c04101 +++$+++ I was nearly killed.
c19036 +++$+++ General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
c18184 +++$+++ Please! I need your help.
c08151 +++$+++ Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
c20227 +++$+++ Two cars.  Where are you?
c15812 +++$+++ Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
c21718 +++$+++ I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
c10545 +++$+++ About yourself?
c25666 +++$+++ Which one's which?
c23378 +++$+++ I like them french-fried potaters.
c02013 +++$+++ Shouldn't we tell Homer?
c11476 +++$+++ Yes, what else?
c15219 +++$+++ It's dug.
c19725 +++$+++ She'll be in, in the morning...
c07847 +++$+++ Pardon?
c00274 +++$+++ No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
c06162 +++$+++ [Who's he?]
c22588 +++$+++ Drink, drink, Juanito. You'll never have it so good.
c21745 +++$+++ You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
c22986 +++$+++ Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
c09936 +++$+++ And what does that mean?
c19069 +++$+++ That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
c02636 +++$+++ Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
c10375 +++$+++ Oh, Laura.
c17403 +++$+++ That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
c04299 +++$+++ No. Don't be silly. It's just...
c01679 +++$+++ Yeah?
c02451 +++$+++ Same thing, isn't it?
c26173 +++$+++ That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
c01234 +++$+++ How so?
c17045 +++$+++ Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
c11000 +++$+++ Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
c26147 +++$+++ Yes.
c18503 +++$+++ Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
c24643 +++$+++ Did Sidney tell you about it?
c16305 +++$+++ Yah. Owner was on the desk then, said these two guys had company.
c03149 +++$+++ Damn mind of it's own.
c26649 +++$+++ Madeleine --
c18871 +++$+++ That's open to debate.
c27158 +++$+++ Just like that?
c11091 +++$+++ - and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
c04216 +++$+++ Isn't that her picture?
c01802 +++$+++ YOU'RE A LIAR!
c07959 +++$+++ What would you do, Dad?
c01662 +++$+++ Sandy?
c08080 +++$+++ That I should've picked you up?
c03694 +++$+++ I'm sorry, but do I know you --
c10988 +++$+++ But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
c14468 +++$+++ Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
c24794 +++$+++ We're going to figure this out.  Get a grip on yourself.
c10751 +++$+++ It's getting dark. Go home.
c26209 +++$+++ Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
c10390 +++$+++ Yes.
c05371 +++$+++ But you suspect.
c16715 +++$+++ You just burned the desk.
c20850 +++$+++ Always...By the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
c19759 +++$+++ George, I hate sitcoms.
c26293 +++$+++ I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
c26070 +++$+++ Bob?
c18647 +++$+++ Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
c08637 +++$+++ That wasn't a good night, no.
c08300 +++$+++ Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
c14115 +++$+++ I'm going to class.
c10098 +++$+++ I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
c01869 +++$+++ The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
c11663 +++$+++ He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
c10904 +++$+++ What sheets?
c07236 +++$+++ I don't know.
c15408 +++$+++ Uh-huh?
c07601 +++$+++ I dyed one and washed the other.
c03523 +++$+++ I don't like your tone.
c20305 +++$+++ He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
c19845 +++$+++ This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
c04774 +++$+++ Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but-- you've been very kind.
c18105 +++$+++ Can you get me into the Ambassador's reception?
c18930 +++$+++ And you just want to ask me a few questions?
c18192 +++$+++ Well, I guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
c05315 +++$+++ Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
c04853 +++$+++ There were admirals.
c15763 +++$+++ That's because you grew up rich.
c22951 +++$+++ Well... what the fuck, man?
c17270 +++$+++ So I was replaced by Mitch?
c12027 +++$+++ Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
c23668 +++$+++ Is he gon' be gone long?
c23810 +++$+++ What?
c07119 +++$+++ I don't want them to love me.
c09645 +++$+++ Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
c26990 +++$+++ The...
c19548 +++$+++ Yeah.
c15789 +++$+++ Yup.
c26511 +++$+++ He didn't have my lawyer.
c24508 +++$+++ Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
c13732 +++$+++ The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
c02472 +++$+++ Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
c19164 +++$+++ I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
c13103 +++$+++ I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
c11439 +++$+++ What does that mean?
c15441 +++$+++ No. Who?
c26915 +++$+++ You told him about us?
c10128 +++$+++ Yes it is.
c08363 +++$+++ SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
c15943 +++$+++ Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
c01876 +++$+++ Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
c10081 +++$+++ Your turn?
c09553 +++$+++ Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
c21391 +++$+++ He'll win.
c04369 +++$+++ Get with what?
c13795 +++$+++ How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
c07721 +++$+++ It's so nice.
c12843 +++$+++ Well, I can help.
c15856 +++$+++ And you think you're the one to apply some heat?
c16154 +++$+++ Big Ed's?  Big Ed's Tires?  Why...?
c19165 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c10806 +++$+++ 24 Trident missiles.  Eight MIRVs per missile.
c27119 +++$+++ Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
c09202 +++$+++ Smile... good?
c04423 +++$+++ I left it at work.
c11494 +++$+++ Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
c09672 +++$+++ One apple pie! You want more coffee?
c09217 +++$+++ I do not want to.
c06745 +++$+++ And what did he say?
c11889 +++$+++ What did you do to your hair?
c00351 +++$+++ It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
c25775 +++$+++ Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
c00583 +++$+++ He's terribly busy, sir.
c13233 +++$+++ Did you see my cat?
