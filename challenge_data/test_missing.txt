c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ You be careful.
c00000 +++$+++ There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
c00000 +++$+++ Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
c00000 +++$+++ I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
c00000 +++$+++ I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ Come on, what were you going to say?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
c00000 +++$+++ But even here we were supposed to find who knows what... And all we bring back with us is a crate of cigarettes.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, there's some flaws in her...
c00000 +++$+++ Neither do I.
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ Doug, the traffic light...
c00000 +++$+++ The phone company was broken up.
c00000 +++$+++ You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
c00000 +++$+++ Look Mrs Spitz... I don't know to whom I'm indebted for the recommendation but... I'm not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
c00000 +++$+++ Who told you my name?
c00000 +++$+++ Your guess is as good as mine.
c00000 +++$+++ No. No. Let's go upstairs.
c00000 +++$+++ Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, now what about your sidekick punching my favorite detective? What the hell is going on?  You got no discipline in your operation.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes?
c00000 +++$+++ Charisma?
c00000 +++$+++ What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
c00000 +++$+++ You don't feel cold?
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ I lost my job...
c00000 +++$+++ Thank Christ!  We lost you!  Listen, there's been a new development --
c00000 +++$+++ Oh. Sorry.
c00000 +++$+++ Full power, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
c00000 +++$+++ What's that?
c00000 +++$+++ You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
c00000 +++$+++ I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
c00000 +++$+++ Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
c00000 +++$+++ That's the past.  It's dead.
c00000 +++$+++ Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
c00000 +++$+++ Murder!
c00000 +++$+++ How about -- ?
c00000 +++$+++ The most logical choice.
c00000 +++$+++ I also PVC'd you.  Youngest Officer promoted to Sergeant. Two CMs.  Four honor medals...
c00000 +++$+++ Where do you want to go?
c00000 +++$+++ I did?
c00000 +++$+++ She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
c00000 +++$+++ Two in a row?
c00000 +++$+++ <i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
c00000 +++$+++ There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
c00000 +++$+++ I wasn't helping you for money.
c00000 +++$+++ Been on the crop. May need to get some extra hands if I don't want to work on Sundays.
c00000 +++$+++ Should I be worried?
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you.
c00000 +++$+++ You came all the way down here to tell me that?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, I hope we got them in time.
c00000 +++$+++ Dad.
c00000 +++$+++ Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
c00000 +++$+++ You're a killer, Ozzy!
c00000 +++$+++ I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
c00000 +++$+++ What good will that do?
c00000 +++$+++ I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
c00000 +++$+++ If we ... er ...
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Enid ate a whole pan!
c00000 +++$+++ What's that, Curly?
c00000 +++$+++ When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, I hate them.
c00000 +++$+++ So am I going to help you with your foot?
c00000 +++$+++ 1932? That's like, that's like...
c00000 +++$+++ Nobody cares, Ronald.
c00000 +++$+++ Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
c00000 +++$+++ We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, you run on now.
c00000 +++$+++ Where?
c00000 +++$+++ Of course, I do.
c00000 +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
c00000 +++$+++ Tell him it hurt --
c00000 +++$+++ Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
c00000 +++$+++ Now, now.
c00000 +++$+++ It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm still having trouble with English.
c00000 +++$+++ That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
c00000 +++$+++ Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
c00000 +++$+++ Doesn't it have a name?
c00000 +++$+++ Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
c00000 +++$+++ Susie's not a virgin anymore.
c00000 +++$+++ But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
c00000 +++$+++ It's for your finger.
c00000 +++$+++ You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
c00000 +++$+++ And your husband works for somebody else.
c00000 +++$+++ There aren't enough arrows.
c00000 +++$+++ Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
c00000 +++$+++ No. I can't really see it.
c00000 +++$+++ They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these muskets?
c00000 +++$+++ Just say no.
c00000 +++$+++ A good time! Is that all you care about?!
c00000 +++$+++ --And it is in my power to confer a very signal honor upon you. In my official capacity, therefore, I--
c00000 +++$+++ Nothing's going to happen. I'll come with you.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, what do you really think, though?
c00000 +++$+++ You... You mean Earth?
c00000 +++$+++ He asked me to stay.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
c00000 +++$+++ To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
c00000 +++$+++ Alone or surrounded?
c00000 +++$+++ Dream on, blue eye.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't know--just that she was afraid--
c00000 +++$+++ Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
c00000 +++$+++ Shut your mouth and drive!
c00000 +++$+++ You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
c00000 +++$+++ Who are the Britons?
c00000 +++$+++ It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
c00000 +++$+++ I keep thinking about him.
c00000 +++$+++ Er, my check, please.
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ "Ray!"
c00000 +++$+++ See you next weekend?
c00000 +++$+++ There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
c00000 +++$+++ Wandering about.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
c00000 +++$+++ I swear on my life, I won't...
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
c00000 +++$+++ There's nobody left around here now.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh Christ.
c00000 +++$+++ With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
c00000 +++$+++ You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
c00000 +++$+++ I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
c00000 +++$+++ And he is living proof.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
c00000 +++$+++ That's right.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ How long's he staying for?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
c00000 +++$+++ C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
c00000 +++$+++ Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
c00000 +++$+++ ...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
c00000 +++$+++ Every guy has a type!
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
c00000 +++$+++ Civilization as we know it is unraveling before our eyes.  But Logan and Max, with a song in their hearts are gonna march into battle to keep that from happening.
c00000 +++$+++ Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, so now it's my fault?
c00000 +++$+++ Go  that's the way we're going to go.  What do you say?
c00000 +++$+++ Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
c00000 +++$+++ Not that I don't enjoy a good urban legend now and then but what does any of this have to do with me?
c00000 +++$+++ He...  cares. He actually cares about these . . . . . .these People. These earth People .
c00000 +++$+++ You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
c00000 +++$+++ Beautiful all over, eh?
c00000 +++$+++ Where am I? And how can I leave?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
c00000 +++$+++ You have his address?
c00000 +++$+++ New Yorkers.
c00000 +++$+++ We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
c00000 +++$+++ No. I never feel like that.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't think so.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
c00000 +++$+++ One day you will.
c00000 +++$+++ Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
c00000 +++$+++ But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't think this is any time to be funny...
c00000 +++$+++ What shape is the scar?
c00000 +++$+++ Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
c00000 +++$+++ Uhh... I with it sister but...
c00000 +++$+++ I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ That was a misunderstanding.
c00000 +++$+++ What the fuck are you talking about.
c00000 +++$+++ Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, but--
c00000 +++$+++ Have you tried the duck?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ But you did -- I just heard it.
c00000 +++$+++ No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
c00000 +++$+++ Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
c00000 +++$+++ Well...
c00000 +++$+++ David.
c00000 +++$+++ She's just outside the door.
c00000 +++$+++ I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
c00000 +++$+++ I can.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, it was there.
c00000 +++$+++ We think it's Ricky Tan.  If you don't want to take the case, I'll understand.
c00000 +++$+++ Thirty-five bucks.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh baby...I don't know anyone could pay anybody anything for work they did themselves...But if you all need to eat until your mother's well, all you have to do is say so...We have a church committee invented so nobody had to go hungry.
c00000 +++$+++ And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
c00000 +++$+++ He's not Army, it's not official --
c00000 +++$+++ That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson. I'd forget it if I were you.
c00000 +++$+++ I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
c00000 +++$+++ To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
c00000 +++$+++ Here.  This'll put hair on your chest.
c00000 +++$+++ So?
c00000 +++$+++ And it's just in one ear?
c00000 +++$+++ What novel did you read.
c00000 +++$+++ Let's go peep from the living room.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
c00000 +++$+++ How lucky's Miss Universe gotta be?
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
c00000 +++$+++ Good god.
c00000 +++$+++ If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers.
c00000 +++$+++ If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
c00000 +++$+++ Now, I'm not going to wear ear- rings, I can tell you that.
c00000 +++$+++ Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ Because you always obey orders ...
c00000 +++$+++ They think it's your First Wife...
c00000 +++$+++ Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
c00000 +++$+++ Will you help me out...?
c00000 +++$+++ Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
c00000 +++$+++ He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
c00000 +++$+++ You like me better like this.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
c00000 +++$+++ And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
c00000 +++$+++ ...unmarked hundreds....
c00000 +++$+++ Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
c00000 +++$+++ Every word.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll talk to the Mayor.
c00000 +++$+++ I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
c00000 +++$+++ But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll put this past my boss
c00000 +++$+++ You are <u>defending</u> what you did?
c00000 +++$+++ Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
c00000 +++$+++ It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
c00000 +++$+++ Who are you?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
c00000 +++$+++ How is she alright looking the way she does?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
c00000 +++$+++ Apple core?
c00000 +++$+++ But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
c00000 +++$+++ You mean that "load" of passengers?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
c00000 +++$+++ How do you know you can trust me?
c00000 +++$+++ Didja tell 'em anything else?
c00000 +++$+++ But his leg!
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah ?--How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
c00000 +++$+++ Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
c00000 +++$+++ I think so. I was just taking a shower.
c00000 +++$+++ Were you a drug addict?
c00000 +++$+++ Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
c00000 +++$+++ Should I be afraid?
c00000 +++$+++ Who cares what he spells it? Read the letter.
c00000 +++$+++ Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
c00000 +++$+++ All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
c00000 +++$+++ The last one you'll ever see.
c00000 +++$+++ You got me.
c00000 +++$+++ What happend?
c00000 +++$+++ I can back it up.
c00000 +++$+++ You got a problem with me, Grady?
c00000 +++$+++ Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
c00000 +++$+++ I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
c00000 +++$+++ It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
c00000 +++$+++ Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
c00000 +++$+++ I will consider it.  Now leave me.
c00000 +++$+++ This picture--
c00000 +++$+++ Dinner.  Don't be angry.
c00000 +++$+++ ) You cannot kill them all.
c00000 +++$+++ Typical male.
c00000 +++$+++ Blank faces here, O'Neil.
c00000 +++$+++ I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, he drove it into the river.
c00000 +++$+++ Yikes! No. Paul wasn't into that. He followed a balanced diet and-
c00000 +++$+++ I feel like the night before the first day of school.
c00000 +++$+++ Show.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll get the girl.
c00000 +++$+++ Let me carry one of the instruments.
c00000 +++$+++ We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. You want me to get her?
c00000 +++$+++ No... Friends from the diner maybe?
c00000 +++$+++ MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
c00000 +++$+++ Where are you headed?
c00000 +++$+++ Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
c00000 +++$+++ A little older than Paloma is now.
c00000 +++$+++ Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
c00000 +++$+++ What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you believe him?
c00000 +++$+++ That's great Earl!
c00000 +++$+++ It's 2041...
c00000 +++$+++ Fight what?
c00000 +++$+++ All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard.
c00000 +++$+++ She just needs a new windshield wiper.
c00000 +++$+++ But why do you want me?
c00000 +++$+++ I need it.
c00000 +++$+++ You lost me.
c00000 +++$+++ God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
c00000 +++$+++ Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
c00000 +++$+++ Help yourself prickfuck!
c00000 +++$+++ I guess I could teach you some things.
c00000 +++$+++ See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
c00000 +++$+++ This is he?
c00000 +++$+++ You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
c00000 +++$+++ I saw what I saw.
c00000 +++$+++ Except for Small Eyes.
c00000 +++$+++ No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
c00000 +++$+++ Eating sushi?
c00000 +++$+++ That's your expert opinion?
c00000 +++$+++ Whose truth are you talking about?
c00000 +++$+++ Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
c00000 +++$+++ Washington sent ya. I know that.
c00000 +++$+++ Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
c00000 +++$+++ You want some company?
c00000 +++$+++ You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
c00000 +++$+++ Where do you think you'll go?
c00000 +++$+++ Did you got through my pants?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't understand. What about you?
c00000 +++$+++ Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
c00000 +++$+++ You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
c00000 +++$+++ You mean the one who --
c00000 +++$+++ The same thing.
c00000 +++$+++ No shit?
c00000 +++$+++ Kind of.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, aren't you excited?
c00000 +++$+++ Who is he?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, Maya. No.
c00000 +++$+++ What does that mean?
c00000 +++$+++ A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
c00000 +++$+++ Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
c00000 +++$+++ No, the dog.
c00000 +++$+++ Can't be any worse than this. What do you think?
c00000 +++$+++ Who's running it!
c00000 +++$+++ Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
c00000 +++$+++ I think she's trying that.
c00000 +++$+++ A man whose life was empty!
c00000 +++$+++ I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
c00000 +++$+++ Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
c00000 +++$+++ But you know who did.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
c00000 +++$+++ We were married two years before the baby.  And then four very difficult years.
c00000 +++$+++ It was too noisy.
c00000 +++$+++ I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm just here about my brother.
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you.
c00000 +++$+++ Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
c00000 +++$+++ Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
c00000 +++$+++ -- what?
c00000 +++$+++ Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
c00000 +++$+++ Very funny, smart ass.
c00000 +++$+++ Two of us might be more effective than one.
c00000 +++$+++ You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
c00000 +++$+++ And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
c00000 +++$+++ La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
c00000 +++$+++ Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
c00000 +++$+++ That's not what I mean.
c00000 +++$+++ When may I expect the cleaners?
c00000 +++$+++ "Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
c00000 +++$+++ No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
c00000 +++$+++ Carl can wait.
c00000 +++$+++ Six.
c00000 +++$+++ Ever think of moving there full time?
c00000 +++$+++ Like this.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
c00000 +++$+++ Dr. Arroway, you are entitled to your opinion.  But we feel quite strongly that it would by both irresponsible and naive to send a human being into a completely unknown, completely uncontrollable situation absolutely defenseless.
c00000 +++$+++ I thought you had something planned.
c00000 +++$+++ You should get the order you want.
c00000 +++$+++ Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
c00000 +++$+++ Frank, but not now.  Frank.  You're trying to wipe out some old business.  But not now.  I understand.  But you go call 'em back.  You call the Bishop back.
c00000 +++$+++ Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
c00000 +++$+++ A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
c00000 +++$+++ My what?
c00000 +++$+++ Thought you had to use some of these.
c00000 +++$+++ I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
c00000 +++$+++ Did she say that?
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
c00000 +++$+++ He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
c00000 +++$+++ An old man's dream.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
c00000 +++$+++ But I...
c00000 +++$+++ I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
c00000 +++$+++ You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
c00000 +++$+++ I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
c00000 +++$+++ You're soft.
c00000 +++$+++ Please!
c00000 +++$+++ Mm-hm.
c00000 +++$+++ Where's Charlie?
c00000 +++$+++ Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
c00000 +++$+++ How do you know?
c00000 +++$+++ There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
c00000 +++$+++ I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
c00000 +++$+++ I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
c00000 +++$+++ You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
c00000 +++$+++ All right, then this is old stuff to you.
c00000 +++$+++ That's a sharp jacket.
c00000 +++$+++ You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
c00000 +++$+++ What kind?
c00000 +++$+++ What do ya want the others to get?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I'm listening now.
c00000 +++$+++ Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
c00000 +++$+++ That's none of your business.
c00000 +++$+++ You know who it was?
c00000 +++$+++ Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
c00000 +++$+++ Can't I?
c00000 +++$+++ I have work to do.
c00000 +++$+++ They're not that Jewish.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, rock particles.  Dust.
c00000 +++$+++ Finn ...
c00000 +++$+++ "In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
c00000 +++$+++ If you went down on a horse... You'd tell me, right?
c00000 +++$+++ The Presidency.  The public loves him.
c00000 +++$+++ Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
c00000 +++$+++ Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things been goin'?
c00000 +++$+++ That's what I had in mind.
c00000 +++$+++ Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
c00000 +++$+++ He left us!  He left us!
c00000 +++$+++ --it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
c00000 +++$+++ Go home!
c00000 +++$+++ You still mad at him?
c00000 +++$+++ Fine thank you.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I know that now.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, cool.
c00000 +++$+++ And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
c00000 +++$+++ No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
c00000 +++$+++ Pure idiot.
c00000 +++$+++ Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
c00000 +++$+++ Let me go! Let me go!!
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
c00000 +++$+++ I never had it.
c00000 +++$+++ Plus he fell in love with a temp.
c00000 +++$+++ I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
c00000 +++$+++ This is the anniversary of the summer of love and your city fathers have declared a Festival of Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of Commerce don't want TV announcing killers on the loose.
c00000 +++$+++ Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
c00000 +++$+++ I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
c00000 +++$+++ There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up.  Are they all shark victims?
c00000 +++$+++ Where does he work?
c00000 +++$+++ And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
c00000 +++$+++ Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
c00000 +++$+++ A man to see you.
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah? What do I do then?
c00000 +++$+++ Don't think it's not going to cost you.
c00000 +++$+++ Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ Why don't we go over to the theatre and see what's really happening? After all, we've only heard from a small portion of the audience. Let's hear what the majority thinks.
c00000 +++$+++ She was murdered?
c00000 +++$+++ How'd you get that.
c00000 +++$+++ No, not yet Jack. We just bought the story. Saturday Evening Post.
c00000 +++$+++ "It?"
c00000 +++$+++ You sure?
c00000 +++$+++ Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
c00000 +++$+++ What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
c00000 +++$+++ SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening. What's yours? Wait, let me guess. THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY? Am I close?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
c00000 +++$+++ You! Don't make me laugh.
c00000 +++$+++ Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
c00000 +++$+++ You're asking for my documents?
c00000 +++$+++ What whispers?
c00000 +++$+++ Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
c00000 +++$+++ We don't have minutes. Can you give me phaser power?
c00000 +++$+++ Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
c00000 +++$+++ Smells like something died.
c00000 +++$+++ Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ I said go ahead.
c00000 +++$+++ That's what it's about.
c00000 +++$+++ Smoking or non-smoking?
c00000 +++$+++ --Graduate Thesis--
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
c00000 +++$+++ What -- what sort of action do you mean?
c00000 +++$+++ We have to talk.  Whether to kill yourself is one of the most important decisions a teenager has to make.
c00000 +++$+++ Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
c00000 +++$+++ The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
c00000 +++$+++ Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
c00000 +++$+++ Sure, you got one?
c00000 +++$+++ You off your rocker?
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't sell it.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
c00000 +++$+++ That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
c00000 +++$+++ On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
c00000 +++$+++ CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
c00000 +++$+++ Charming guy, Basil.  Once after beating an army of Serbians he blinded all but-
c00000 +++$+++ All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
c00000 +++$+++ Then talk to your brother, goddamn it. The two of you don't need any advice to get into trouble.
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
c00000 +++$+++ You do?
c00000 +++$+++ I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
c00000 +++$+++ What now?
c00000 +++$+++ How?
c00000 +++$+++ Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--
c00000 +++$+++ How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
c00000 +++$+++ A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
c00000 +++$+++ Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
c00000 +++$+++ Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ Then why are you looking for her?
c00000 +++$+++ What did you think?
c00000 +++$+++ Of course.
c00000 +++$+++ Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll tell you the effect!  It pisses me off!
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ 'Intimate? !"
c00000 +++$+++ ) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
c00000 +++$+++ Then you still love me?
c00000 +++$+++ Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
c00000 +++$+++ Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you think he'll take the job?
c00000 +++$+++ What happened to you?
c00000 +++$+++ You promised.
c00000 +++$+++ Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
c00000 +++$+++ It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
c00000 +++$+++ No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
c00000 +++$+++ Disease? What disease?
c00000 +++$+++ The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
c00000 +++$+++ It's my nature.
c00000 +++$+++ Nerves.
c00000 +++$+++ That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
c00000 +++$+++ Uh, you're driving a-
c00000 +++$+++ Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
c00000 +++$+++ ...and therafore there is no consequence?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, just traveling through, huh?
c00000 +++$+++ Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
c00000 +++$+++ I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
c00000 +++$+++ Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, right.
c00000 +++$+++ Amateurs!
c00000 +++$+++ He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
c00000 +++$+++ Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
c00000 +++$+++ What about Jorgensen?
c00000 +++$+++ He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you do?
c00000 +++$+++ Does that mean you love me?
c00000 +++$+++ Flash, drop it--
c00000 +++$+++ You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
c00000 +++$+++ They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
c00000 +++$+++ We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.
c00000 +++$+++ Where ?
c00000 +++$+++ You remember how a production eats up one's life.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
c00000 +++$+++ I guess so, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ I know, but we're on a college campus...
c00000 +++$+++ I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
c00000 +++$+++ ... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh my God!
c00000 +++$+++ I bet.  Going into people's homes.
c00000 +++$+++ And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
c00000 +++$+++ I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
c00000 +++$+++ I am not!
c00000 +++$+++ Tell me.
c00000 +++$+++ Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
c00000 +++$+++ Like waking. Like you always just woke up.							 *
c00000 +++$+++ Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
c00000 +++$+++ You believe that?
c00000 +++$+++ Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah. I bet he would.
c00000 +++$+++ Claire...
c00000 +++$+++ Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
c00000 +++$+++ Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry. Let's go.
c00000 +++$+++ <u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
c00000 +++$+++ Well sure, Colonel --
c00000 +++$+++ The old lady?
c00000 +++$+++ Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
c00000 +++$+++ Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
c00000 +++$+++ I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
c00000 +++$+++ I know your parents.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm going to Florida.
c00000 +++$+++ What are you going to do?
c00000 +++$+++ Why not?
c00000 +++$+++ How's the bottle?
c00000 +++$+++ Go!
c00000 +++$+++ Me, sir?
c00000 +++$+++ Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
c00000 +++$+++ How'd you know that?  Kay?
c00000 +++$+++ I have school.
c00000 +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?
c00000 +++$+++ If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
c00000 +++$+++ He hasn't.
c00000 +++$+++ Would you remember his name?
c00000 +++$+++ What's it mean?
c00000 +++$+++ Unofficially, General Greene.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm here.
c00000 +++$+++ Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
c00000 +++$+++ Great.
c00000 +++$+++ What happened?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
c00000 +++$+++ I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
c00000 +++$+++ She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
c00000 +++$+++ Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
c00000 +++$+++ A mystery.
c00000 +++$+++ No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
c00000 +++$+++ The ship....
c00000 +++$+++ I said I promise!
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
c00000 +++$+++ You got a gun?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, shall we go through Documentation?
c00000 +++$+++ Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
c00000 +++$+++ No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
c00000 +++$+++ I know, I was wrong.  But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
c00000 +++$+++ Ni!
c00000 +++$+++ Did they give him special care?
c00000 +++$+++ Radar, he's underwater.  But he's definitely coming.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
c00000 +++$+++ I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
c00000 +++$+++ I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
c00000 +++$+++ Guess so.
c00000 +++$+++ 78th.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
c00000 +++$+++ I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
c00000 +++$+++ Don't you dare.
c00000 +++$+++ Which one's your building?
c00000 +++$+++ I hope everything is settled.
c00000 +++$+++ The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
c00000 +++$+++ I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.
c00000 +++$+++ Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
c00000 +++$+++ I think he's moved...
c00000 +++$+++ Uh-oh.
c00000 +++$+++ It was a good ad-lib, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ Let's go back, Barry...
c00000 +++$+++ Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
c00000 +++$+++ Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
c00000 +++$+++ A friend?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ Aha. Poet or philosopher?
c00000 +++$+++ Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
c00000 +++$+++ Shemp is right here in this room...two minutes from now, and at exactly 9:02PM, we'll catch up to him.
c00000 +++$+++ You were such a super lady...  and then I... I been so lonely...
c00000 +++$+++ Fourteen, Harry.
c00000 +++$+++ How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, no. She brought me my meals.
c00000 +++$+++ Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
c00000 +++$+++ I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
c00000 +++$+++ I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
c00000 +++$+++ How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
c00000 +++$+++ Fine.
c00000 +++$+++ How?
c00000 +++$+++ What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
c00000 +++$+++ Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know. How do I know?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm never going back.
c00000 +++$+++ Why would they exaggerate?
c00000 +++$+++ I feel like shit...
c00000 +++$+++ Now, you've got more sense than to put Nosey onto this guy--!
c00000 +++$+++ Norman...
c00000 +++$+++ I can't take shorthand.
c00000 +++$+++ Not on my own beat, no.
c00000 +++$+++ Say more.
c00000 +++$+++ He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
c00000 +++$+++ I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
c00000 +++$+++ What about Don?
c00000 +++$+++ Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
c00000 +++$+++ Surely not.
c00000 +++$+++ Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction. This man is not a prisoner of war. Not any more. He is a saboteur.
c00000 +++$+++ I apologize.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.  Maybe.
c00000 +++$+++ Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
c00000 +++$+++ How the hell did you get here.
c00000 +++$+++ Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
c00000 +++$+++ You've done pretty well.
c00000 +++$+++ Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
c00000 +++$+++ Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
c00000 +++$+++ And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
c00000 +++$+++ The Hoop-dee-doo!
c00000 +++$+++ They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
c00000 +++$+++ Irene is going to help.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you mean, odd? We was robbed like I told you.
c00000 +++$+++ There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
c00000 +++$+++ I'll call the police.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah?
c00000 +++$+++ It's....whatever....that's not cool.
c00000 +++$+++ Well how do <u>I</u> know what they're--
c00000 +++$+++ Most women wouldn't choose it.
c00000 +++$+++ M'hm.  You're not gonna believe this, but-
c00000 +++$+++ Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
c00000 +++$+++ You don't use shit?
c00000 +++$+++ Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
c00000 +++$+++ This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
c00000 +++$+++ What ?
c00000 +++$+++ You don't know where you're going?
c00000 +++$+++ You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
c00000 +++$+++ No!  There's no such thing as "just two ants."  You never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
c00000 +++$+++ Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
c00000 +++$+++ So we on the same page then?
c00000 +++$+++ They could be.
c00000 +++$+++ And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
c00000 +++$+++ -- a sense of proportion.
c00000 +++$+++ Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
c00000 +++$+++ They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
c00000 +++$+++ In that event, the probabilities are that our mission would fail.
c00000 +++$+++ Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
c00000 +++$+++ The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
c00000 +++$+++ What did you watch?
c00000 +++$+++ So?  What do they know?
c00000 +++$+++ Then who wins?
c00000 +++$+++ And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
c00000 +++$+++ I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
c00000 +++$+++ She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
c00000 +++$+++ The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
c00000 +++$+++ Or the Bijou.  Either one.
c00000 +++$+++ What for?
c00000 +++$+++ On my own.
c00000 +++$+++ You're a piece of shit
c00000 +++$+++ Well... at least now you know.
c00000 +++$+++ Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
c00000 +++$+++ MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
c00000 +++$+++ What honey?
c00000 +++$+++ He will be odd, different.
c00000 +++$+++ You married?
c00000 +++$+++ I want you to head right home after school.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ Then will you teach me what I need to know.  Maybe we learn from each other, if that's possible, no?
c00000 +++$+++ Quince, I've got confidence in you.
c00000 +++$+++ Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
c00000 +++$+++ I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
c00000 +++$+++ Sorry to hear it.
c00000 +++$+++ Did I kill a guy named Benito?
c00000 +++$+++ Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
c00000 +++$+++ Lissen. This wind's fixin't to *do* somepin'!
c00000 +++$+++ Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
c00000 +++$+++ Shall we track them both?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
c00000 +++$+++ On the show I talk to the computer and repeat what it says. So that's what they built.
c00000 +++$+++ Kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sure you have Buzz.
c00000 +++$+++ That's even better.
c00000 +++$+++ Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
c00000 +++$+++ [What do you mean?]
c00000 +++$+++ I'm leaving Sunday.
c00000 +++$+++ Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors!
c00000 +++$+++ That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
c00000 +++$+++ Guess!
c00000 +++$+++ A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
c00000 +++$+++ Dissent?
c00000 +++$+++ I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
c00000 +++$+++ He's gonna find out.
c00000 +++$+++ This committee owes an apology!
c00000 +++$+++ On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
c00000 +++$+++ Get out.
c00000 +++$+++ Did you trace it?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  He does.
c00000 +++$+++ How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, five years we've been together?  Who do I thank?
c00000 +++$+++ I mind you said there was two.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll come straight there.
c00000 +++$+++ Should I keep reading?
c00000 +++$+++ Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
c00000 +++$+++ Is it good?
c00000 +++$+++ Where does everyone sleep?
c00000 +++$+++ You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
c00000 +++$+++ But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
c00000 +++$+++ I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
c00000 +++$+++ That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I --
c00000 +++$+++ What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
c00000 +++$+++ I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
c00000 +++$+++ Who?
c00000 +++$+++ I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
c00000 +++$+++ Zander is going for pilot, too.
c00000 +++$+++ You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
c00000 +++$+++ When?
c00000 +++$+++ By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
c00000 +++$+++ Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
c00000 +++$+++ How high is that?
c00000 +++$+++ The Federal Building was too well guarded.
c00000 +++$+++ Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
c00000 +++$+++ That's an order!
c00000 +++$+++ Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
c00000 +++$+++ Nice bunch of guys.
c00000 +++$+++ Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
c00000 +++$+++ I missed...
c00000 +++$+++ But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
c00000 +++$+++ C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
c00000 +++$+++ What's that, peanut?
c00000 +++$+++ You left her.  How's that for a fact?
c00000 +++$+++ Especially now.
c00000 +++$+++ You-you play... very well.
c00000 +++$+++ Thanks.
c00000 +++$+++ No, I wouldn't.
c00000 +++$+++ It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now.
c00000 +++$+++ Do I?
c00000 +++$+++ It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
c00000 +++$+++ Ya know, I ain't never been in an institution of psychology before.
c00000 +++$+++ Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
c00000 +++$+++ ........... It's a bomb isn't it?
c00000 +++$+++ Do you smell shit?
c00000 +++$+++ You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
c00000 +++$+++ Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
c00000 +++$+++ Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
c00000 +++$+++ Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
c00000 +++$+++ It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
c00000 +++$+++ Are you scared?
c00000 +++$+++ ...Is everything okay?
c00000 +++$+++ By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, I crash there.
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you want me to come up and tuck you in?
c00000 +++$+++ Give him the sedative!
c00000 +++$+++ Because I don't feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
c00000 +++$+++ Of course!
c00000 +++$+++ Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh God.
c00000 +++$+++ Sleeeeew sheek baw...
c00000 +++$+++ I'm only allowed "G" movies.
c00000 +++$+++ This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
c00000 +++$+++ We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
c00000 +++$+++ Gone where?
c00000 +++$+++ Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
c00000 +++$+++ One of your instincts?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
c00000 +++$+++ One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
c00000 +++$+++ I want to believe.
c00000 +++$+++ No thanks.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm fine.
c00000 +++$+++ An evil petting zoo?
c00000 +++$+++ He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
c00000 +++$+++ Tonight it is.
c00000 +++$+++ The family know?
c00000 +++$+++ Really?
c00000 +++$+++ What happened?
c00000 +++$+++ So who was he with?
c00000 +++$+++ How do you know I will?
c00000 +++$+++ To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
c00000 +++$+++ How do you work it with the key?
c00000 +++$+++ This is incredible. I was just sitting here trying to figure out how to contact you. I mean, you don't have an answering service, right?
c00000 +++$+++ You're frightened.
c00000 +++$+++ Everything in moderation, Clerval.
c00000 +++$+++ Is someone in the room with you?
c00000 +++$+++ No -- she asked me about cocaine.
c00000 +++$+++ Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just -
c00000 +++$+++ I can't guarantee that...
c00000 +++$+++ You're American.
c00000 +++$+++ Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
c00000 +++$+++ No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
c00000 +++$+++ And tell me that she's happy.
c00000 +++$+++ I hear she was a terror to work with.
c00000 +++$+++ And no people.
c00000 +++$+++ That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
c00000 +++$+++ And I said I would never leave you.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ We have a daughter.
c00000 +++$+++ You'll find enough Cong up there.
c00000 +++$+++ Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
c00000 +++$+++ A very lucky thing indeed.
c00000 +++$+++ If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
c00000 +++$+++ You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
c00000 +++$+++ Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
c00000 +++$+++ You're kind of cultivating a new look.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
c00000 +++$+++ School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
c00000 +++$+++ We sell children's toys --
c00000 +++$+++ All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
c00000 +++$+++ He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
c00000 +++$+++ No. But it's a nice idea.
c00000 +++$+++ An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
c00000 +++$+++ Voice stress analyzer.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
c00000 +++$+++ Some say you are, Rocky.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
c00000 +++$+++ I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
c00000 +++$+++ Who to?
c00000 +++$+++ Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
c00000 +++$+++ Where?!
c00000 +++$+++ You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of torture. Say it, brother, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
c00000 +++$+++ You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
c00000 +++$+++ What if someone tries to steal it?
c00000 +++$+++ Dad, they come in through the doors.
c00000 +++$+++ We're gone.
c00000 +++$+++ The trick is to look like you don't need it, then they give you shit for free.
c00000 +++$+++ I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
c00000 +++$+++ I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.
c00000 +++$+++ How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
c00000 +++$+++ Do you have the...
c00000 +++$+++ I think so.
c00000 +++$+++ Passport?
c00000 +++$+++ The sets were good.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know they just always need it.
c00000 +++$+++ If I told you it might not come true.
c00000 +++$+++ If there's anything I can do for you -
c00000 +++$+++ Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
c00000 +++$+++ Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
c00000 +++$+++ It isn't him.  Frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
c00000 +++$+++ I always do.
c00000 +++$+++ I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
c00000 +++$+++ I believe I should interview the widow alone.
c00000 +++$+++ Copy. And Lundegaard too.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't you want to go to the airport?
c00000 +++$+++ You want to go talk?
c00000 +++$+++ You can trust me on this one.
c00000 +++$+++ What?...
c00000 +++$+++ Well make a dog, make a parakeet! I'm sure you'll think of something.
c00000 +++$+++ A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
c00000 +++$+++ But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
c00000 +++$+++ Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
c00000 +++$+++ Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
c00000 +++$+++ Then you do it.
c00000 +++$+++ Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
c00000 +++$+++ My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
c00000 +++$+++ Me?  I'm busy.  Just finished one script.  I'm due on another assignment.
c00000 +++$+++ Let's go see them.
c00000 +++$+++ Ready.
c00000 +++$+++ I'd better get back now.
c00000 +++$+++ It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
c00000 +++$+++ No chance.
c00000 +++$+++ And maybe you lie...
c00000 +++$+++ They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
c00000 +++$+++ It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
c00000 +++$+++ A good place for what?  He's insane!
c00000 +++$+++ He may be.
c00000 +++$+++ Still, it must be kinda rough.
c00000 +++$+++ I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
c00000 +++$+++ Why don't we both forget about him?
c00000 +++$+++ And you have him?
c00000 +++$+++ He's a plumber.
c00000 +++$+++ I thought you said they needed discipline?
c00000 +++$+++ My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
c00000 +++$+++ Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, that's good. It's about time to eat and you know what I'm cravin'? Some of that take out chicken. Why don't you run get some of it, honey, for lunch?
c00000 +++$+++ But how can I do that?
c00000 +++$+++ How much would I get paid?
c00000 +++$+++ May I introduce my father? He is on a short visit here and returning very soon to Salzburg. He would so much like to kiss your hand. It would make his whole stay so memorable for him.
c00000 +++$+++ Why don't we go to your room-
c00000 +++$+++ Then what?
c00000 +++$+++ And what does that make you?
c00000 +++$+++ Tell me what she wore.
c00000 +++$+++ It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
c00000 +++$+++ But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
c00000 +++$+++ How do I know you'll keep your word?
c00000 +++$+++ Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
c00000 +++$+++ Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
c00000 +++$+++ There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
c00000 +++$+++ Ah!
c00000 +++$+++ You sure it wasn't me?
c00000 +++$+++ That's it.
c00000 +++$+++ No.  I cannot take orders from that underwear model.  That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
c00000 +++$+++ For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
c00000 +++$+++ Can you help? I've no money...
c00000 +++$+++ Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
c00000 +++$+++ If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
c00000 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c00000 +++$+++ The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
c00000 +++$+++ ...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
c00000 +++$+++ I love you, my brother, do you know that?
c00000 +++$+++ And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
c00000 +++$+++ You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
c00000 +++$+++ We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
c00000 +++$+++ I said "yes."
c00000 +++$+++ Hauser?  You're Hauser.
c00000 +++$+++ Joe, I can't look at you any more.
c00000 +++$+++ This here's Loretta.
c00000 +++$+++ Three-one-zero, aye!
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, it is, Hal.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm here, I'm listening.
c00000 +++$+++ I was right. you are Superman.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
c00000 +++$+++ Sir.  I thought those records were sealed.
c00000 +++$+++ No. I'll wait here.
c00000 +++$+++ After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
c00000 +++$+++ Finish him, finish him. Your way.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, but I wouldn't...
c00000 +++$+++ I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
c00000 +++$+++ God.  This is the kitchen, huh?
c00000 +++$+++ Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
c00000 +++$+++ How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
c00000 +++$+++ About forty minutes.
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll get it.  Please, I don't mind.
c00000 +++$+++ Realized what?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I haven't seen any. I wouldn't worry about it. Look, I better go.
c00000 +++$+++ Now what kind of statue was that?
c00000 +++$+++ Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
c00000 +++$+++ Which we've overflown twice.
c00000 +++$+++ I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
c00000 +++$+++ No, because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about, which makes 85% of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me.
c00000 +++$+++ Probably because it sounds scary.				*
c00000 +++$+++ What does she fear?  What about my Father?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ Bats aren't rodents, Dr. Meridian.
c00000 +++$+++ Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
c00000 +++$+++ Your dance is over.
c00000 +++$+++ That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you think about their wives or their families?
c00000 +++$+++ Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
c00000 +++$+++ Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
c00000 +++$+++ I get it.  You're the goon fetch boy.  The zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
c00000 +++$+++ "Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?
c00000 +++$+++ Harry.
c00000 +++$+++ But he saw you, right?
c00000 +++$+++ But we don't need it, I'm sure.
c00000 +++$+++ Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
c00000 +++$+++ ...no ...no ...
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
c00000 +++$+++ But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
c00000 +++$+++ No. You?
c00000 +++$+++ Has anybody offered to buy it?
c00000 +++$+++ Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
c00000 +++$+++ We don't have a whole lotta choice, do we?  I can't figure out if they're real smart or just really, really lucky.
c00000 +++$+++ So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
c00000 +++$+++ Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
c00000 +++$+++ I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
c00000 +++$+++ Well, it's a binary formula--a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work.
c00000 +++$+++ You are.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, no, I didn't actually.
c00000 +++$+++ You're sure?
c00000 +++$+++ Do I actually *see* this--?
c00000 +++$+++ About what?
c00000 +++$+++ You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
c00000 +++$+++ There's no question.  You don't have any.
c00000 +++$+++ All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
c00000 +++$+++ I doubt that decision is still mine to make.
c00000 +++$+++ That's right.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ He was a great boy for that. What else?
c00000 +++$+++ I've never given it much thought.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm separated.
c00000 +++$+++ Now?
c00000 +++$+++ For killing a dolphin.
c00000 +++$+++ Why should I think anything's weird, if I don't know nothin' about them knowing each other?
c00000 +++$+++ I just did.
c00000 +++$+++ You can save that and tell it to the police.  They'll be here in a minute.
c00000 +++$+++ They hate each other --
c00000 +++$+++ Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
c00000 +++$+++ --You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
c00000 +++$+++ Will I be?
c00000 +++$+++ Say something, Mark, say something --
c00000 +++$+++ He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
c00000 +++$+++ Look... I don't know what your problem is...
c00000 +++$+++ ... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
c00000 +++$+++ Time out.
c00000 +++$+++ You're going?
c00000 +++$+++ But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
c00000 +++$+++ Egad, were you horrified?
c00000 +++$+++ So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
c00000 +++$+++ Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
c00000 +++$+++ How much, do you think?
c00000 +++$+++ Huh?
c00000 +++$+++ The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
c00000 +++$+++ 'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
c00000 +++$+++ "For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
c00000 +++$+++ That ring--
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ Many times.
c00000 +++$+++ You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
c00000 +++$+++ Well no -- not exactly -- but --
c00000 +++$+++ We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
c00000 +++$+++ That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
c00000 +++$+++ His wife?
c00000 +++$+++ Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
c00000 +++$+++ How will it?
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
c00000 +++$+++ ...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
c00000 +++$+++ 7 to 2.  That ain't bad.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
c00000 +++$+++ I'm goin' to try and keep from it as much as I can.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
c00000 +++$+++ Name?
c00000 +++$+++ Cost ya a buck.
c00000 +++$+++ What's that?
c00000 +++$+++ "60 Minutes," the television show?
c00000 +++$+++ Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
c00000 +++$+++ He knows.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm an enemy?
c00000 +++$+++ You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
c00000 +++$+++ What year?
c00000 +++$+++ You think my play is bad?
c00000 +++$+++ With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too.  So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want!  Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!!  But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible!  I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt!
c00000 +++$+++ Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
c00000 +++$+++ Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
c00000 +++$+++ You little pissant--
c00000 +++$+++ Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
c00000 +++$+++ Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
c00000 +++$+++ And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, we'll order out.
c00000 +++$+++ She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
c00000 +++$+++ Are you willing to give me your son in exchange for an extension of our contract?
c00000 +++$+++ Mm.
c00000 +++$+++ I hope it wasn't something I did.
c00000 +++$+++ I can't right now.
c00000 +++$+++ No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
c00000 +++$+++ It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
c00000 +++$+++ I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
c00000 +++$+++ These disks . . . where are they?
c00000 +++$+++ Something's up wi...
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know. I thought you might. Any idea what the job is?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay.
c00000 +++$+++ And he's never tried to get in touch with his son?
c00000 +++$+++ And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
c00000 +++$+++ No!
c00000 +++$+++ What you say?
c00000 +++$+++ ... I'm not sleeping well...
c00000 +++$+++ That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
c00000 +++$+++ Geez, you okay, Margie?
c00000 +++$+++ It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
c00000 +++$+++ A fellow investor.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, don't worry.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
c00000 +++$+++ All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
c00000 +++$+++ You really think so?
c00000 +++$+++ That is a trifle strong.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
c00000 +++$+++ No. But I don't think that matters.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh God...
c00000 +++$+++ Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
c00000 +++$+++ It's humiliating.
c00000 +++$+++ Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
c00000 +++$+++ How you erase this?
c00000 +++$+++ More or less.
c00000 +++$+++ Trail him!  Trail who?
c00000 +++$+++ They kept saying they believe in nothing.
c00000 +++$+++ Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
c00000 +++$+++ We'll pray anyway.
c00000 +++$+++ I've never met her. My mother set it up.
c00000 +++$+++ -- I didn't know it would come to this --
c00000 +++$+++ You got it all worked out, don't you?
c00000 +++$+++ I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
c00000 +++$+++ ...lost the screw...
c00000 +++$+++ You're intrigued?
c00000 +++$+++ Whose idea was it?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
c00000 +++$+++ I thought you promised to give me some distance?
c00000 +++$+++ Same thing Giuliani said.
c00000 +++$+++ Or Kat....
c00000 +++$+++ Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
c00000 +++$+++ I think I got one today.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't kill nobody without him.
c00000 +++$+++ Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
c00000 +++$+++ My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Tractor beam, aye!
c00000 +++$+++ Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
c00000 +++$+++ I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not interested in that.
c00000 +++$+++ Like you'd get if it was hand held.
c00000 +++$+++ But Claire--
c00000 +++$+++ There is no weather in space.
c00000 +++$+++ Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
c00000 +++$+++ Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
c00000 +++$+++ I guess I did.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know, Booth.
c00000 +++$+++ But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
c00000 +++$+++ Could be that fall you took.
c00000 +++$+++ No, I don't.
c00000 +++$+++ Who?
c00000 +++$+++ Mind if I come in?
c00000 +++$+++ What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
c00000 +++$+++ Twenty-two, eighty-three...
c00000 +++$+++ His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself.
c00000 +++$+++ Ain't gonna collect your pay?
c00000 +++$+++ This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
c00000 +++$+++ Oooohh! A fruit cake. Thank you, Mrs. Sutphin. Have a seat.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
c00000 +++$+++ I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
c00000 +++$+++ Your insight is enlightening.
c00000 +++$+++ This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
c00000 +++$+++ Fifteen.
c00000 +++$+++ I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
c00000 +++$+++ Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
c00000 +++$+++ ...If that's the way you wanna put it.
c00000 +++$+++ But suppose it doesn't?
c00000 +++$+++ No he had to - he's just - he's out...
c00000 +++$+++ Be a swimmer.
c00000 +++$+++ Come on, man.  I'll make a sailor out of you yet.
c00000 +++$+++ In the chest and stomach.
c00000 +++$+++ That's not why we're here.
c00000 +++$+++ We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
c00000 +++$+++ Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
c00000 +++$+++ How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
c00000 +++$+++ I thought that was for when we were very very old?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
c00000 +++$+++ Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I wonder - will I ever go back? What do you think?
c00000 +++$+++ I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
c00000 +++$+++ Look at her! She'll never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
c00000 +++$+++ No. No, you don't.
c00000 +++$+++ You'll do it?
c00000 +++$+++ It is morning.
c00000 +++$+++ His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
c00000 +++$+++ Can you see under the faceplate?
c00000 +++$+++ *That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
c00000 +++$+++ You'd try anything.  I got first dibs.  You get ya own stuff.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
c00000 +++$+++ A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
c00000 +++$+++ Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
c00000 +++$+++ Move aside!
c00000 +++$+++ I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
c00000 +++$+++ You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
c00000 +++$+++ And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
c00000 +++$+++ They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
c00000 +++$+++ What will you do?
c00000 +++$+++ Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
c00000 +++$+++ The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
c00000 +++$+++ What guy?
c00000 +++$+++ What about him? Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ Tell me.
c00000 +++$+++ So why tell me now?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
c00000 +++$+++ My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
c00000 +++$+++ At least gimme video poker.
c00000 +++$+++ Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
c00000 +++$+++ Pretty much the same reasons I was crying.  But things will be better when we move to a new place.
c00000 +++$+++ Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
c00000 +++$+++ Street cats?
c00000 +++$+++ Look, can I just call a cab?
c00000 +++$+++ What's a prom?
c00000 +++$+++ You've known him long?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah!
c00000 +++$+++ When was the last time I said a word?
c00000 +++$+++ I haven't killed _you_.
c00000 +++$+++ ...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
c00000 +++$+++ Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ You ready to eat?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm listed.
c00000 +++$+++ He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
c00000 +++$+++ She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
c00000 +++$+++ I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
c00000 +++$+++ What's one more to you? Like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to Hell?
c00000 +++$+++ So he really loved her?
c00000 +++$+++ I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
c00000 +++$+++ Are we leaving?
c00000 +++$+++ Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ "Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
c00000 +++$+++ Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
c00000 +++$+++ What do you want me to say?
c00000 +++$+++ If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
c00000 +++$+++ Not in those words.
c00000 +++$+++ So few come back...
c00000 +++$+++ Think, Jew florist?
c00000 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c00000 +++$+++ What's he do?
c00000 +++$+++ And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
c00000 +++$+++ No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
c00000 +++$+++ Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
c00000 +++$+++ I'm your blood.
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ You can't. You're afraid!
c00000 +++$+++ I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
c00000 +++$+++ Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
c00000 +++$+++ How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
c00000 +++$+++ And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
c00000 +++$+++ Pup corn?
c00000 +++$+++ We're working as hard as we can --
c00000 +++$+++ Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
c00000 +++$+++ I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me, Lou.  I'll accept your resignation.
c00000 +++$+++ He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
c00000 +++$+++ Isn't it true?
c00000 +++$+++ What is she gonna do here?
c00000 +++$+++ Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
c00000 +++$+++ Very realistic.
c00000 +++$+++ Tell me.
c00000 +++$+++ I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll give you these people.
c00000 +++$+++ That's funny!
c00000 +++$+++ Boys like him have -- expectations.
c00000 +++$+++ Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
c00000 +++$+++ What kind of show.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm really sorry.
c00000 +++$+++ Roy.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, now that you've mentioned it -
c00000 +++$+++ This isn't in our database?
c00000 +++$+++ Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
c00000 +++$+++ No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
c00000 +++$+++ I sent her to the party.  I figured I'd wait up here until you killed Tran.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ No foolin'? Will you?
c00000 +++$+++ Wait. What do I do?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah... whatever you say.
c00000 +++$+++ Live ones where only the dead should be?
c00000 +++$+++ You liked my singing?
c00000 +++$+++ The war dropped him here and forgot him.
c00000 +++$+++ Really?
c00000 +++$+++ A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
c00000 +++$+++ Enigma.
c00000 +++$+++ Tell the doctor.
c00000 +++$+++ Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
c00000 +++$+++ And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
c00000 +++$+++ Can you prove any of this?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
c00000 +++$+++ ...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
c00000 +++$+++ The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
c00000 +++$+++ Excuse me. What did you say?
c00000 +++$+++ Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ What'd you say?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't understand.
c00000 +++$+++ Sounds intriguing.
c00000 +++$+++ Video.
c00000 +++$+++ N... No,  I just did the Ink Spots.
c00000 +++$+++ "What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
c00000 +++$+++ So?
c00000 +++$+++ You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
c00000 +++$+++ He went to meet that stewardess.
c00000 +++$+++ Let's see if we have a pass for Betty Elms ... and we do. Here we go. And good luck Miss. Elms.
c00000 +++$+++ Cheers.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll have someone show you to your room.
c00000 +++$+++ What I do know is that whatever he's becoming, Sid 6.7 is going to be even worse than he was before.
c00000 +++$+++ It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
c00000 +++$+++ Where's your mom?
c00000 +++$+++ That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
c00000 +++$+++ I hate you! I hate you! I wish I was never artificially created in a lab.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't understand.
c00000 +++$+++ Will you lead me to her?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
c00000 +++$+++ You know me -- married to my work.
c00000 +++$+++ You're only right.
c00000 +++$+++ Everything... I don't have children.
c00000 +++$+++ The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ John has fallen in love with me!
c00000 +++$+++ You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
c00000 +++$+++ No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
c00000 +++$+++ No. Probably I don't.
c00000 +++$+++ Baron!
c00000 +++$+++ Marcia's living with a singer?
c00000 +++$+++ I was just looking in an old annual and...
c00000 +++$+++ But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
c00000 +++$+++ Nobody touches me.
c00000 +++$+++ That sounds kind of pessimistic.
c00000 +++$+++ Really? What do you feel?
c00000 +++$+++ The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
c00000 +++$+++ No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
c00000 +++$+++ Cassie, thank Christ!  We're under attack.
c00000 +++$+++ What does that mean?
c00000 +++$+++ Working for the District Attorney.
c00000 +++$+++ Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
c00000 +++$+++ Which means he probably knew her.
c00000 +++$+++ Come on.  We don't have much time.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, now, Mister, that sounds all right. But--
c00000 +++$+++ It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's . . . I don't know, stalking us.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
c00000 +++$+++ CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
c00000 +++$+++ Too late for apologies, Walker.
c00000 +++$+++ If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
c00000 +++$+++ Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe.  I don't know.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
c00000 +++$+++ I see. Outside it.
c00000 +++$+++ Where, the mall?
c00000 +++$+++ Can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
c00000 +++$+++ You first!
c00000 +++$+++ Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
c00000 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c00000 +++$+++ What did you do?
c00000 +++$+++ What do you actually know with religion?
c00000 +++$+++ I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
c00000 +++$+++ Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about this!  Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will!  You understand?
c00000 +++$+++ Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
c00000 +++$+++ Bullshit.
c00000 +++$+++ No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.
c00000 +++$+++ A surprise?
c00000 +++$+++ - and share one of your graves.
c00000 +++$+++ No.  I don't think so--
c00000 +++$+++ They're rounding up a posse.  Figure an hour?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
c00000 +++$+++ Did it hurt?
c00000 +++$+++ Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  I'm sure.
c00000 +++$+++ I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ Aren't you a plucky little -- ?
c00000 +++$+++ We've done that already.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, sure.
c00000 +++$+++ That's what I want to talk to you about?
c00000 +++$+++ Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
c00000 +++$+++ Two Cokes.
c00000 +++$+++ Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
c00000 +++$+++ I was so afraid you ...
c00000 +++$+++ How was the beach?
c00000 +++$+++ Another reason??? Did I miss something???
c00000 +++$+++ No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
c00000 +++$+++ What's she like?
c00000 +++$+++ Why would we do that?
c00000 +++$+++ He has it. Thank you.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't use big bills!
c00000 +++$+++ I preffer to stand.
c00000 +++$+++ Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
c00000 +++$+++ Are you still in Crystal City?
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ You're being stupid.
c00000 +++$+++ Goddamn it, sir...
c00000 +++$+++ What they like then?
c00000 +++$+++ At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
c00000 +++$+++ You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
c00000 +++$+++ I never make bets or guesses, that way I'm never wrong and I never have to pay out.
c00000 +++$+++ Why?  Why me?
c00000 +++$+++ You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
c00000 +++$+++ Do I?
c00000 +++$+++ In front of a little -- it's a bit... You want a mirror?
c00000 +++$+++ It's not a contest.
c00000 +++$+++ What for?
c00000 +++$+++ Let me go.
c00000 +++$+++ With all my heart.
c00000 +++$+++ Godfather.
c00000 +++$+++ I am answering...
c00000 +++$+++ Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
c00000 +++$+++ Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
c00000 +++$+++ There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't know.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
c00000 +++$+++ That's too bad, Jeff. Well, I guess I can't be lucky every day. Forget I called.
c00000 +++$+++ Near Carvel?
c00000 +++$+++ No, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ Entirely.
c00000 +++$+++ You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
c00000 +++$+++ Get away, Snorri.
c00000 +++$+++ Invulnerable.
c00000 +++$+++ You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
c00000 +++$+++ I completely agree.
c00000 +++$+++ Sid?
c00000 +++$+++ Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
c00000 +++$+++ If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
c00000 +++$+++ The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
c00000 +++$+++ Right now at least one girl is dead and Jamie Lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  She is the last of his blood line.  If she dies --
c00000 +++$+++ For who?  The fish?
c00000 +++$+++ Of course.
c00000 +++$+++ Scott, You can't save everyone.
c00000 +++$+++ Listen to me, cocksucker. There is no Keyser Sate. If you say his name again, I'11 kill you right here.
c00000 +++$+++ -- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
c00000 +++$+++ Where did it come from, Mama?
c00000 +++$+++ It's also the major piece of evidence, and it makes you a key part of his plan.  You can't run away from it anymore.  Look at the order he's doing them... He did three as the Boston Strangler just to tell us a copycat serial killer was at work.  Then he did one like the Hillside Strang- ler.  And then one as Son of Sam. To lead us on -- to where and what end?  And he's doing more than that -- he's imitating each killer's method as closely as he can -- in details.  Injecting Windex.  Using .44.  Playing Abba.
c00000 +++$+++ Whom you address.
c00000 +++$+++ You're off to a late start.
c00000 +++$+++ Why the hell do you need all four bags of books to go to school each day?
c00000 +++$+++ Gentlemen--that's nice.
c00000 +++$+++ And how do you feel about that?
c00000 +++$+++ Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
c00000 +++$+++ Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
c00000 +++$+++ Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. I don't like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. In fact, to be very frank, Mr. Mitchell, I don't think I like you.
c00000 +++$+++ Can it work?
c00000 +++$+++ Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
c00000 +++$+++ Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
c00000 +++$+++ Does she know anything about this?
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ -- water! --
c00000 +++$+++ SING!
c00000 +++$+++ You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ All right then.
c00000 +++$+++ In the gut, I mean.
c00000 +++$+++ Me?
c00000 +++$+++ Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
c00000 +++$+++ What if I say no?
c00000 +++$+++ Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact --- I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her ---- to see her ---- to touch her ---- in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
c00000 +++$+++ What can we do' mate?
c00000 +++$+++ A 'deal'?
c00000 +++$+++ No!  Look at you!  You're... you're running around in ski masks, exploding things...
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
c00000 +++$+++ Are you feeling okay?
c00000 +++$+++ Could you bring it up?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
c00000 +++$+++ What did he say?
c00000 +++$+++ And you believe it?
c00000 +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know what you're -
c00000 +++$+++ I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and...  my first yuppie.
c00000 +++$+++ Who are you trying to convince?
c00000 +++$+++ I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
c00000 +++$+++ Josh said...
c00000 +++$+++ Is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
c00000 +++$+++ ...why?
c00000 +++$+++ Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
c00000 +++$+++ You will?
c00000 +++$+++ Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
c00000 +++$+++ No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
c00000 +++$+++ I wish dawdie was with us.
c00000 +++$+++ That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
c00000 +++$+++ Are you sad?  Are we going to church? For your confession?
c00000 +++$+++ A blue rose.
c00000 +++$+++ That's okay... doesn't matter.
c00000 +++$+++ Is it against the law?
c00000 +++$+++ Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
c00000 +++$+++ Very generous.
c00000 +++$+++ No rain.
c00000 +++$+++ I have a suggestion. Why don't we take a break.
c00000 +++$+++ Right.  So why is he dying?  He doesn't appear to have any broken bones, no entry wounds of any kind -- what's killing him?
c00000 +++$+++ No way.
c00000 +++$+++ Carrie.
c00000 +++$+++ As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
c00000 +++$+++ What's the matter with my place?
c00000 +++$+++ You take this much time over everything?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm going to try to remove it.
c00000 +++$+++ What day?
c00000 +++$+++ Can you fix it?
c00000 +++$+++ I...?  I saw it.  I was there.
c00000 +++$+++ Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
c00000 +++$+++ -- sure.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
c00000 +++$+++ It won't work like that.
c00000 +++$+++ What's a concubine?
c00000 +++$+++ Thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
c00000 +++$+++ And tonight?
c00000 +++$+++ You didn't tell him about me?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
c00000 +++$+++ I'll come over when I'm ready.
c00000 +++$+++ I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
c00000 +++$+++ Is her husband sick or something?
c00000 +++$+++ It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
c00000 +++$+++ It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
c00000 +++$+++ I really don't think it's a good idea.
c00000 +++$+++ I guess not.
c00000 +++$+++ Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't threaten me, Bob.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
c00000 +++$+++ Not about coming to see Daitz?
c00000 +++$+++ You can believe that if you want to.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
c00000 +++$+++ OK. Say what it is.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.
c00000 +++$+++ There's only one worth noticing.
c00000 +++$+++ You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
c00000 +++$+++ An offense --
c00000 +++$+++ The poet...something he said...
c00000 +++$+++ I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
c00000 +++$+++ No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
c00000 +++$+++ I never met the man.
c00000 +++$+++ He... didn't have me..  I told you-
c00000 +++$+++ And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
c00000 +++$+++ How did they get away?
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't mean just the Theater.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
c00000 +++$+++ He's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. Tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  I've yet to see it. Never a courtesy.  Never a thank you note.  He forgets my wife at Christmas time -
c00000 +++$+++ No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
c00000 +++$+++ So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
c00000 +++$+++ <u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
c00000 +++$+++ Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
c00000 +++$+++ Mind your business.
c00000 +++$+++ Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
c00000 +++$+++ was so scared--that it scared--
c00000 +++$+++ We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
c00000 +++$+++ Who?
c00000 +++$+++ Where --
c00000 +++$+++ Kenilworth.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't celebrate til it's over.
c00000 +++$+++ To land any closer would risk detection.
c00000 +++$+++ -- well, when does it get good?
c00000 +++$+++ Struck out eighteen...
c00000 +++$+++ I still don't know what that means.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
c00000 +++$+++ Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
c00000 +++$+++ Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
c00000 +++$+++ But what about them?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
c00000 +++$+++ Steve...
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
c00000 +++$+++ How can that be?
c00000 +++$+++ How did you know -- ?
c00000 +++$+++ Would you excuse us, please...?
c00000 +++$+++ Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
c00000 +++$+++ <u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
c00000 +++$+++ That's not news, Zoe.
c00000 +++$+++ YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
c00000 +++$+++ You getting out too?
c00000 +++$+++ Do you expect me to believe...?
c00000 +++$+++ SOME PEOPLE DO IT TO BE FUNNY
c00000 +++$+++ To avenge his father, and the others.
c00000 +++$+++ What, senorita?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm a what?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm wearing, Archie.
c00000 +++$+++ There's talk of that.
c00000 +++$+++ Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
c00000 +++$+++ I gotta go back.
c00000 +++$+++ Will you lighten up, please?
c00000 +++$+++ He drown?
c00000 +++$+++ Has he?
c00000 +++$+++ Why, I don't know.
c00000 +++$+++ Sounds familiar.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
c00000 +++$+++ For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
c00000 +++$+++ I have the stuff from last year's...
c00000 +++$+++ What evening?
c00000 +++$+++ You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing?
c00000 +++$+++ No! Not enough!  In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
c00000 +++$+++ A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
c00000 +++$+++ One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
c00000 +++$+++ Who's the old geezer?
c00000 +++$+++ I am?
c00000 +++$+++ Don't you believe it.
c00000 +++$+++ He hates Oliver Stone.
c00000 +++$+++ VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
c00000 +++$+++ It doesn't seem right.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't understand.
c00000 +++$+++ Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
c00000 +++$+++ Ohh... do you own a cat?
c00000 +++$+++ I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
c00000 +++$+++ We are...
c00000 +++$+++ Cenobites. Explorers in the further regions of experience. Demons to some. Angels to others.
c00000 +++$+++ What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
c00000 +++$+++ You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
c00000 +++$+++ Like a party for all our friends.
c00000 +++$+++ He is the King.
c00000 +++$+++ Is Tony one of your animals?
c00000 +++$+++ He says things.  Bad things.
c00000 +++$+++ I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
c00000 +++$+++ Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
c00000 +++$+++ Twelve.
c00000 +++$+++ Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
c00000 +++$+++ It'll do.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
c00000 +++$+++ You're kidding yourself.
c00000 +++$+++ C'mon, there's not much difference--
c00000 +++$+++ This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
c00000 +++$+++ It must be great.
c00000 +++$+++ A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
c00000 +++$+++ Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
c00000 +++$+++ What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
c00000 +++$+++ We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it.  At least right now it's keeping him alive.
c00000 +++$+++ Shall we go away for a couple of days?
c00000 +++$+++ I come from Lisbon.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
c00000 +++$+++ Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
c00000 +++$+++ You better keep a low profile for a while.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
c00000 +++$+++ My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't ever let go.
c00000 +++$+++ I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
c00000 +++$+++ Let me go out like a man.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ You're kiddin' me.
c00000 +++$+++ Well you've gotta be prepared.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
c00000 +++$+++ You're not stupid.
c00000 +++$+++ The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
c00000 +++$+++ You have a card in here?
c00000 +++$+++ Nada. Vague description, that's all. Fine-tooth-combed Speck's car, the diner: no fingerprints, no trace evidence.
c00000 +++$+++ You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
c00000 +++$+++ When ya had it, did ya like it?
c00000 +++$+++ I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
c00000 +++$+++ Now, that's really stupid.
c00000 +++$+++ That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
c00000 +++$+++ I left him a message.
c00000 +++$+++ What about your film? Isn't it due next week? Have you even started it?
c00000 +++$+++ Don't underestimate me.  I've got original ideas of my own.  Warhol got famous doing a soup can.  What would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
c00000 +++$+++ I was thinking the same thing.  He must be local.  It's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized Andy's voice and called him by name.  What about this?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, absolutely.
c00000 +++$+++ You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
c00000 +++$+++ No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
c00000 +++$+++ That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
c00000 +++$+++ What for?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
c00000 +++$+++ No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
c00000 +++$+++ How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
c00000 +++$+++ That's under lock and key.
c00000 +++$+++ But if you could, you would?
c00000 +++$+++ I answered these questions last night.
c00000 +++$+++ They told me, Major.  And I didn't hear anything about any atomic attack.
c00000 +++$+++ You've slept with twelve different girls?
c00000 +++$+++ "You could be swinging on a star."
c00000 +++$+++ Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
c00000 +++$+++ What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwangler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
c00000 +++$+++ No. You said I. I killed them.
c00000 +++$+++ How do you like that one?
c00000 +++$+++ Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.
c00000 +++$+++ You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
c00000 +++$+++ What about Janet?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c00000 +++$+++ In a restaurant.  You sit there and they swim around you.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not going to Vegas.
c00000 +++$+++ As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
c00000 +++$+++ And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
c00000 +++$+++ Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I ...
c00000 +++$+++ What have you set your mind to?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
c00000 +++$+++ I have five-hundred dollars.
c00000 +++$+++ And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
c00000 +++$+++ There is not one thing funny here.
c00000 +++$+++ Go away, unless you got my money.
c00000 +++$+++ You know where the chemicals are?
c00000 +++$+++ I get the picture.
c00000 +++$+++ I hope so, too, Mr. Kint. Can I get you something to drink?
c00000 +++$+++ Come on.
c00000 +++$+++ The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
c00000 +++$+++ Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
c00000 +++$+++ -- Tonight he forgot.
c00000 +++$+++ You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
c00000 +++$+++ Don't let's talk about it.
c00000 +++$+++ Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
c00000 +++$+++ Actually, I was a wonderful father.
c00000 +++$+++ What... what are you saying?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
c00000 +++$+++ Never.
c00000 +++$+++ Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
c00000 +++$+++ When do I get time for me?
c00000 +++$+++ There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
c00000 +++$+++ Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
c00000 +++$+++ And when she goes to those places...
c00000 +++$+++ The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
c00000 +++$+++ Get out of here....
c00000 +++$+++ Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
c00000 +++$+++ That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
c00000 +++$+++ Well , who's in command here?
c00000 +++$+++ No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
c00000 +++$+++ I want you to meet my cousin.
c00000 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c00000 +++$+++ He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
c00000 +++$+++ No, but I heard it was great.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c00000 +++$+++ Only you.
c00000 +++$+++ What about the Cromwells?
c00000 +++$+++ Doctor's orders- - -?
c00000 +++$+++ Materials. Nothing more.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't remember.
c00000 +++$+++ I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
c00000 +++$+++ Graffiti --
c00000 +++$+++ He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?
c00000 +++$+++ No, I meant you didn't have to tackle me and rip my dress.  A polite push, perhaps?  A clear shout of "watch out, Anna" would have done nicely...
c00000 +++$+++ I just don't like it.
c00000 +++$+++ Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't "shoplift the pooty."  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
c00000 +++$+++ How long does it take a man to land?
c00000 +++$+++ Surely you know the one who made you...
c00000 +++$+++ How'd you know I was here?
c00000 +++$+++ Tommy...
c00000 +++$+++ Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
c00000 +++$+++ Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
c00000 +++$+++ Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
c00000 +++$+++ They'll hang him all the same.
c00000 +++$+++ To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
c00000 +++$+++ Six months.  Eleven days.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you want us to do?
c00000 +++$+++ We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
c00000 +++$+++ I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do what is necessary.
c00000 +++$+++ But you can't call me while you think?
c00000 +++$+++ It will be just the same.  Enough! I'm tired.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, baby?
c00000 +++$+++ Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
c00000 +++$+++ About a month ago. Six weeks.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm just trying to play the game.
c00000 +++$+++ Jack!  It's Christmas!
c00000 +++$+++ There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
c00000 +++$+++ Stop finishing...
c00000 +++$+++ Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah?
c00000 +++$+++ But I thought high school is only four years.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
c00000 +++$+++ Rafts. Two 38s. A little ammo.
c00000 +++$+++ Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
c00000 +++$+++ The police haven't told you?
c00000 +++$+++ In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
c00000 +++$+++ I shot at one of them.
c00000 +++$+++ There's nothing in the files?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
c00000 +++$+++ With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
c00000 +++$+++ He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, then we'll see you there.
c00000 +++$+++ You're wrong.
c00000 +++$+++ Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
c00000 +++$+++ Will you bring up my purse before you go?
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.
c00000 +++$+++ I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
c00000 +++$+++ Not yet.
c00000 +++$+++ Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
c00000 +++$+++ How long have we been driving?
c00000 +++$+++ Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
c00000 +++$+++ Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
c00000 +++$+++ Whatcha wanta order?
c00000 +++$+++ Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
c00000 +++$+++ You know what I mean.
c00000 +++$+++ Where you got in the shower.
c00000 +++$+++ I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, Bazza, what?
c00000 +++$+++ A vote?
c00000 +++$+++ Drains right into the Central Reservoir.
c00000 +++$+++ Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
c00000 +++$+++ No?
c00000 +++$+++ That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
c00000 +++$+++ And this is your "work"?
c00000 +++$+++ Jennifer.
c00000 +++$+++ I remember.  You just left...
c00000 +++$+++ Not on your life.  That's it. I've had it with crap around this house.  From now on, no more pizza!  Get it?  Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being!
c00000 +++$+++ They know you here--know your name.
c00000 +++$+++ Ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
c00000 +++$+++ I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't you wonder why I do it?
c00000 +++$+++ But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
c00000 +++$+++ Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
c00000 +++$+++ Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  And because you have large resources.
c00000 +++$+++ What??
c00000 +++$+++ Which was?
c00000 +++$+++ You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
c00000 +++$+++ No shit...
c00000 +++$+++ Oh huh
c00000 +++$+++ No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
c00000 +++$+++ Goodnight.
c00000 +++$+++ What can it hurt.
c00000 +++$+++ Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
c00000 +++$+++ I want to go home...
c00000 +++$+++ She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
c00000 +++$+++ Do you have any pictures if her?
c00000 +++$+++ That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
c00000 +++$+++ Shot himself. What for ?
c00000 +++$+++ Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
c00000 +++$+++ In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
c00000 +++$+++ Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
c00000 +++$+++ Have you examined them?
c00000 +++$+++ May we come in?
c00000 +++$+++ What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
c00000 +++$+++ Fine, Louis.  We'll stop in for a drink.
c00000 +++$+++ You're going out?
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ I like it, Nick.
c00000 +++$+++ Hurry.  You have to get them out of there!
c00000 +++$+++ Now you know what to watch for...
c00000 +++$+++ They're going to kill us!
c00000 +++$+++ Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
c00000 +++$+++ That's so you're still getting some money when you hit 65.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know Brady.
c00000 +++$+++ But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
c00000 +++$+++ I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
c00000 +++$+++ She'll never be the same.  None of us will.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
c00000 +++$+++ C'mon, you know that won't...
c00000 +++$+++ Huh?
c00000 +++$+++ You mean Hot Lips? Screw her.
c00000 +++$+++ I know you did....
c00000 +++$+++ I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
c00000 +++$+++ Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
c00000 +++$+++ And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
c00000 +++$+++ You?
c00000 +++$+++ And Hobbs died?
c00000 +++$+++ What was it, somebody's daughter?
c00000 +++$+++ A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
c00000 +++$+++ Why can't it last?
c00000 +++$+++ Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
c00000 +++$+++ Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
c00000 +++$+++ Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
c00000 +++$+++ Being violently ill to her tummy.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
c00000 +++$+++ We'll talk some other -
c00000 +++$+++ Sorry. That's not gonna happen.
c00000 +++$+++ On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
c00000 +++$+++ Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
c00000 +++$+++ A Plague o' both your houses.
c00000 +++$+++ Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
c00000 +++$+++ I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
c00000 +++$+++ He is just wonderful.
c00000 +++$+++ It's not gonna hurt you.
c00000 +++$+++ He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
c00000 +++$+++ You first.
c00000 +++$+++ You left your keys in the ignition.
c00000 +++$+++ Sex.
c00000 +++$+++ You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't.
c00000 +++$+++ Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes I do.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, shit.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, any time I can do anything for you --
c00000 +++$+++ I mean, what has it been -- six months?
c00000 +++$+++ And they loved Bear.
c00000 +++$+++ So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
c00000 +++$+++ Kinda.
c00000 +++$+++ You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
c00000 +++$+++ There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
c00000 +++$+++ Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
c00000 +++$+++ Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
c00000 +++$+++ He's been here all night?
c00000 +++$+++ I said, ask your wife.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ You need to go.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in position immediately. .
c00000 +++$+++ But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
c00000 +++$+++ They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
c00000 +++$+++ That's between you and yourself, Norma.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes ma'am..
c00000 +++$+++ Actually, I don't know...
c00000 +++$+++ I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
c00000 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c00000 +++$+++ Look, Sefton, I had my hands full so they wouldn't tear you apart --
c00000 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c00000 +++$+++ Great.  Big ears, too?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
c00000 +++$+++ You want a muffin?
c00000 +++$+++ Hell, you think I am?
c00000 +++$+++ Whatever looks best and starts the soonest.
c00000 +++$+++ You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
c00000 +++$+++ You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
c00000 +++$+++ If he can do it, yes.
c00000 +++$+++ Shut up, Will.
c00000 +++$+++ I see.
c00000 +++$+++ Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
c00000 +++$+++ Everything.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't, but...
c00000 +++$+++ Eh, Poli Sci?
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
c00000 +++$+++ But why must you indulge in his pornography?
c00000 +++$+++ <i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
c00000 +++$+++ Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
c00000 +++$+++ I wasn't going to say --
c00000 +++$+++ I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
c00000 +++$+++ Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
c00000 +++$+++ None at this time, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
c00000 +++$+++ But couldn't you...?
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't ask any question.
c00000 +++$+++ You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
c00000 +++$+++ This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ Why not?
c00000 +++$+++ Proper?!
c00000 +++$+++ C.O. is Colonel Blake. Lieutenant Colonel Henry Braymore Blake. One of them regular army clowns. Push you around so it's hard to get any decent work done.
c00000 +++$+++ The child cannot harm you.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.  That's the point.
c00000 +++$+++ I'd just like to have a word with her.
c00000 +++$+++ You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
c00000 +++$+++ Get used to disappointment.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
c00000 +++$+++ Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
c00000 +++$+++ That's lame, isn't it?
c00000 +++$+++ Don't.
c00000 +++$+++ What would?
c00000 +++$+++ Hush up such talk, Jabez!
c00000 +++$+++ Then where is she?
c00000 +++$+++ You really think she's been sent... by God?
c00000 +++$+++ Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiance is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
c00000 +++$+++ Hey, I'm not just along for the ride, so I don't want to hear any bullshit later about a smaller cut.
c00000 +++$+++ An' Little Bill killed Ned for what I done?
c00000 +++$+++ That's okay -- really it is.
c00000 +++$+++ I can't?
c00000 +++$+++ It is ended.
c00000 +++$+++ Finland is a country.
c00000 +++$+++ Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
c00000 +++$+++ I said you're soft.
c00000 +++$+++ What's she doing in California?
c00000 +++$+++ You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
c00000 +++$+++ His name?
c00000 +++$+++ Cuba would be a small price to pay.
c00000 +++$+++ I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about.
c00000 +++$+++ Does he bite?
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you.
c00000 +++$+++ No!
c00000 +++$+++ They're not open yet?
c00000 +++$+++ YOU'D like my room.
c00000 +++$+++ Nah.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
c00000 +++$+++ -- it hasn't been two years --
c00000 +++$+++ Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
c00000 +++$+++ You think so?
c00000 +++$+++ I have a B average.
c00000 +++$+++ You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
c00000 +++$+++ But that's what happened before.
c00000 +++$+++ This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
c00000 +++$+++ Then why do you persist in doing it?
c00000 +++$+++ My co-counsel, Ron Motley, and I have filed a lawsuit against the tobacco industry on behalf of the State of Mississippi to get the state reimbursed Medicaid costs for treating people with smoking-related illness.  If you'd be interested in talking to us, we'd certainly like to talk to you...
c00000 +++$+++ When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
c00000 +++$+++ A super market.  Huh.
c00000 +++$+++ How did you know he was a construction worker?
c00000 +++$+++ What choice?
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ That's what Gordon's always saying.
c00000 +++$+++ That crazy guy?
c00000 +++$+++ How dare you say you love me.
c00000 +++$+++ It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't use my name.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ I can do that.
c00000 +++$+++ I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't own a television.
c00000 +++$+++ No, you don't.
c00000 +++$+++ 1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
c00000 +++$+++ uh - then he - be just -
c00000 +++$+++ Give it to me.
c00000 +++$+++ Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
c00000 +++$+++ What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
c00000 +++$+++ What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
c00000 +++$+++ I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
c00000 +++$+++ Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
c00000 +++$+++ I do care about you!
c00000 +++$+++ No, sir. Radar.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you feel you have a chance?
c00000 +++$+++ You're sounding like that mad woman, Widow Baggins.
c00000 +++$+++ The only thing which exists is myself.
c00000 +++$+++ After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
c00000 +++$+++ Mookie, no cursing in the store.
c00000 +++$+++ And then I'll see you in New York --
c00000 +++$+++ Checked and locked, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
c00000 +++$+++ May-I be frank, Counselor? I suspect your political power as much as I respect it. I don't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall, and I don't care. The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here.
c00000 +++$+++ But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
c00000 +++$+++ How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.  You got an injury there, Mayo?
c00000 +++$+++ You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ ...That's what we finally decided.
c00000 +++$+++ Meaning?
c00000 +++$+++ For what?
c00000 +++$+++ Tell him you get seasick on a yacht. Play miniature golf with him.
c00000 +++$+++ According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
c00000 +++$+++ When was this?
c00000 +++$+++ Your mind is so slippery.
c00000 +++$+++ Who is he?
c00000 +++$+++ Those are Feds.
c00000 +++$+++ Honey...
c00000 +++$+++ When you kill Cong, don't you feel something.
c00000 +++$+++ Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
c00000 +++$+++ --the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
c00000 +++$+++ Originals?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
c00000 +++$+++ You know the Jedi Master?
c00000 +++$+++ Chief says...
c00000 +++$+++ I was gonna split it with you guys.
c00000 +++$+++ Something like that.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
c00000 +++$+++ Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
c00000 +++$+++ What are you then?
c00000 +++$+++ Is this becoming complicated?
c00000 +++$+++ If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
c00000 +++$+++ The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
c00000 +++$+++ How are we going to find him?
c00000 +++$+++ War.
c00000 +++$+++ ...Not enough food?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
c00000 +++$+++ You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
c00000 +++$+++ But Sergeant...
c00000 +++$+++ No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
c00000 +++$+++ Why?... Why would you need me?
c00000 +++$+++ You were very nervous.
c00000 +++$+++ Where do you want it?  In the face?
c00000 +++$+++ Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
c00000 +++$+++ Charlie Nicholas, David Niven, Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley. -
c00000 +++$+++ Who would do such a thing?
c00000 +++$+++ Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
c00000 +++$+++ How can you know this?
c00000 +++$+++ How do you know?
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you. I try.
c00000 +++$+++ 'Code Blue'...
c00000 +++$+++ Here's to the greatest job in the world.
c00000 +++$+++ Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
c00000 +++$+++ That can't feel good.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Could we try it now?
c00000 +++$+++ They don't have extermination camps.
c00000 +++$+++ Hospital?
c00000 +++$+++ You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
c00000 +++$+++ That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
c00000 +++$+++ Stop it -- stop it.
c00000 +++$+++ I mean, would you care to join me.
c00000 +++$+++ I said pull over.
c00000 +++$+++ In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
c00000 +++$+++ Well...
c00000 +++$+++ You do not know what you are saying!
c00000 +++$+++ You killed that cop Dutton.
c00000 +++$+++ But the sword could be in his compound.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
c00000 +++$+++ Right now.
c00000 +++$+++ Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
c00000 +++$+++ Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
c00000 +++$+++ They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
c00000 +++$+++ The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
c00000 +++$+++ I can take care of myself.
c00000 +++$+++ Say it.
c00000 +++$+++ Where is Jesse James?
c00000 +++$+++ I can call back...
c00000 +++$+++ No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
c00000 +++$+++ How?
c00000 +++$+++ Mister, I'm calling you out.
c00000 +++$+++ The country boy's about due.
c00000 +++$+++ But you are interested?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
c00000 +++$+++ You're such a good friend.
c00000 +++$+++ No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ What's fair?
c00000 +++$+++ And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
c00000 +++$+++ Need some help?
c00000 +++$+++ Writing seems easy.
c00000 +++$+++ Gone.  Not a trace.
c00000 +++$+++ Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
c00000 +++$+++ Al!!
c00000 +++$+++ I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
c00000 +++$+++ What does that mean?
c00000 +++$+++ I guess you have to get back home soon?
c00000 +++$+++ We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
c00000 +++$+++ Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
c00000 +++$+++ Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
c00000 +++$+++ Saunders--if there was *any* way--
c00000 +++$+++ Safe?
c00000 +++$+++ What about when she identifies him?!
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
c00000 +++$+++ I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ Who knows more about Maureen Prescott than her own daughter?
c00000 +++$+++ She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
c00000 +++$+++ You couldn't.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm... discouraged.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't want to be going around your back.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, sir. Yes, indeedy. Everyone knows Deeds.
c00000 +++$+++ Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
c00000 +++$+++ Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
c00000 +++$+++ I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
c00000 +++$+++ Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
c00000 +++$+++ You shall see.
c00000 +++$+++ To talk to you.
c00000 +++$+++ It's so late.
c00000 +++$+++ And a fact is a fact.
c00000 +++$+++ Alright. Meet me at the Met.
c00000 +++$+++ It's possible they were looking for evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes donation to the Democrats, so the Democrats couldn't make an issue of your Hughes money.
c00000 +++$+++ She didn't know he was a criminal. They had a relationship. They --
c00000 +++$+++ If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
c00000 +++$+++ How long did you watch her?
c00000 +++$+++ Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
c00000 +++$+++ Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
c00000 +++$+++ But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
c00000 +++$+++ Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
c00000 +++$+++ What happened?
c00000 +++$+++ You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
c00000 +++$+++ You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
c00000 +++$+++ <u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
c00000 +++$+++ Witch.
c00000 +++$+++ Not for me.
c00000 +++$+++ That fellow got on at Baskul.
c00000 +++$+++ This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
c00000 +++$+++ You never gave us a chance...
c00000 +++$+++ I am.
c00000 +++$+++ Is it?  Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
c00000 +++$+++ The other side....
c00000 +++$+++ How else do you meet them? Pimps?
c00000 +++$+++ That's a crock of shit.
c00000 +++$+++ I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts?
c00000 +++$+++ Do I have to?
c00000 +++$+++ ... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
c00000 +++$+++ I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
c00000 +++$+++ I've left those pills for you.
c00000 +++$+++ Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ And in return?
c00000 +++$+++ No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
c00000 +++$+++ ... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
c00000 +++$+++ You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
c00000 +++$+++ You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
c00000 +++$+++ This sort of thing!
c00000 +++$+++ No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
c00000 +++$+++ Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
c00000 +++$+++ You walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
c00000 +++$+++ Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
c00000 +++$+++ You invited me.
c00000 +++$+++ I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
c00000 +++$+++ You have not slept in two days.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Can you walk?
c00000 +++$+++ I want them thrown in jail.
c00000 +++$+++ Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
c00000 +++$+++ Who?
c00000 +++$+++ ) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
c00000 +++$+++ During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
c00000 +++$+++ Oh yes. That's fine.
c00000 +++$+++ I am. Let me get the cards.
c00000 +++$+++ No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
c00000 +++$+++ But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
c00000 +++$+++ 'Code Blue'...
c00000 +++$+++ And the chair.
c00000 +++$+++ You're right.  That sounds crazy!
c00000 +++$+++ What did you think?
c00000 +++$+++ I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
c00000 +++$+++ It's him, isn't it?
c00000 +++$+++ -- Then you don't need me.
c00000 +++$+++ Charlotte, who?
c00000 +++$+++ He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
c00000 +++$+++ You're kidding --
c00000 +++$+++ Find out.
c00000 +++$+++ About now.  Would you like a drink?
c00000 +++$+++ Enough.
c00000 +++$+++ Here comes the resume.
c00000 +++$+++ How are you doing?
c00000 +++$+++ If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about!
c00000 +++$+++ What is that... wailing?
c00000 +++$+++ God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
c00000 +++$+++ Cats?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah? What about Laura --
c00000 +++$+++ No, it's Lois!
c00000 +++$+++ I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
c00000 +++$+++ Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
c00000 +++$+++ What would you call it?
c00000 +++$+++ You will come with me.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
c00000 +++$+++ Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
c00000 +++$+++ Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
c00000 +++$+++ All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
c00000 +++$+++ Twenty-five wives!
c00000 +++$+++ Forgot what?
c00000 +++$+++ They're on me. They're smoking me out!
c00000 +++$+++ Far from it.
c00000 +++$+++ Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
c00000 +++$+++ Stop that, Fran.
c00000 +++$+++ Why would you be here?
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ You think that'll help?
c00000 +++$+++ It's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer. Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand.  Those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy. They're jumping in terror.  Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. It's the glitter of putrescence.  There's no beauty here -- it's death and decay.
c00000 +++$+++ You're saying "me."
c00000 +++$+++ I'd appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can't, don't worry about it. I'll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I'm in a hurry.
c00000 +++$+++ Anything I'd know?
c00000 +++$+++ We could get back together too.
c00000 +++$+++ You said it a million times!
c00000 +++$+++ She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
c00000 +++$+++ I have my orders.
c00000 +++$+++ Beats forty hours on a plane.
c00000 +++$+++ Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ It hurt me, Alex.  Very much.
c00000 +++$+++ Are you going to put a spell on me?
c00000 +++$+++ Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
c00000 +++$+++ I knew Lisa Sherman long ago. It's extremely important that I get inside and try to verify that it's the same woman who lived here.
c00000 +++$+++ I love you, too.
c00000 +++$+++ Meet Col --
c00000 +++$+++ You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ She's a precog?
c00000 +++$+++ I know that Charlie but look at my side.  You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him.  What happens if this kid don't pay me?  I gotta collect from you?  I don't want to do that.  I made a deal with him not you, right?
c00000 +++$+++ I spaced out.
c00000 +++$+++ You can't cheat an honest man. But a man like Lionel Dolby...
c00000 +++$+++ Shit! Go!
c00000 +++$+++ You can ask me anything.
c00000 +++$+++ It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
c00000 +++$+++ The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe we should just kiss.
c00000 +++$+++ Slow down!
c00000 +++$+++ Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, heh--
c00000 +++$+++ Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
c00000 +++$+++ This play -- ?
c00000 +++$+++ I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
c00000 +++$+++ Just sandwiches...
c00000 +++$+++ 'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't like her?   What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful ... she's rich ... she's got huge tracts of land ...
c00000 +++$+++ Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
c00000 +++$+++ How's that?
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ Take the card.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, I wanna see the hands. I wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
c00000 +++$+++ He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
c00000 +++$+++ Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
c00000 +++$+++ I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
c00000 +++$+++ You mean here in the city?
c00000 +++$+++ That's a long fall.
c00000 +++$+++ But you don't know what happened.
c00000 +++$+++ Why not?
c00000 +++$+++ That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes! Yes!
c00000 +++$+++ Accept a compliment.
c00000 +++$+++ Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
c00000 +++$+++ I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
c00000 +++$+++ What I love.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
c00000 +++$+++ I lov-loathe Elizabeth Allan. Abhor, detest, despise--
c00000 +++$+++ Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
c00000 +++$+++ No shit.
c00000 +++$+++ -- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
c00000 +++$+++ So, we're talking money laundering...
c00000 +++$+++ You're a fast mover.
c00000 +++$+++ Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
c00000 +++$+++ Waldos.
c00000 +++$+++ America, we shall see.
c00000 +++$+++ It was planted on me, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah...
c00000 +++$+++ Guess!
c00000 +++$+++ Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
c00000 +++$+++ Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
c00000 +++$+++ To make you feel better.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
c00000 +++$+++ Pretty soon I'll be making a move.
c00000 +++$+++ With this guy locked in?
c00000 +++$+++ Is that the mail?
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't say I was.
c00000 +++$+++ Grandpa. My father. It's his.
c00000 +++$+++ To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
c00000 +++$+++ No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
c00000 +++$+++ We're only going to be here a few hours...
c00000 +++$+++ Is she sleeping or...?
c00000 +++$+++ You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
c00000 +++$+++ Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
c00000 +++$+++ It can wait.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
c00000 +++$+++ Wow.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't know!
c00000 +++$+++ Nope.
c00000 +++$+++ What's that supposed to mean?...
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
c00000 +++$+++ I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
c00000 +++$+++ We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
c00000 +++$+++ What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
c00000 +++$+++ Sir... Braking thrusters seem to have fired.
c00000 +++$+++ But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
c00000 +++$+++ What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
c00000 +++$+++ How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't have nothing.
c00000 +++$+++ Be my guest.
c00000 +++$+++ And she began to cry.  And you put an arm around her.
c00000 +++$+++ I have.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
c00000 +++$+++ Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
c00000 +++$+++ It concerns his future!
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ No one knows. They say it blew up.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll think about it.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh God.
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ ...that the prey can bite back.
c00000 +++$+++ And you are William Taupin, aren't you?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
c00000 +++$+++ Was what worth it?
c00000 +++$+++ It stings a little.
c00000 +++$+++ It's always been our policy -
c00000 +++$+++ Oh.
c00000 +++$+++ Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
c00000 +++$+++ There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
c00000 +++$+++ You did Basic here?
c00000 +++$+++ I want him with me.
c00000 +++$+++ I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
c00000 +++$+++ That's your "rep."
c00000 +++$+++ We sure like havin' you.
c00000 +++$+++ That information's being withheld from the media.
c00000 +++$+++ Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh. Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ What happened when he was 17?
c00000 +++$+++ Benjamin -- do they know you?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know, but whatever it is, it's not the crew.
c00000 +++$+++ Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
c00000 +++$+++ What're those?
c00000 +++$+++ I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
c00000 +++$+++ No, you didn't say that, Brother.
c00000 +++$+++ Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was writing a book.
c00000 +++$+++ You rich kids... are all the same !
c00000 +++$+++ Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
c00000 +++$+++ The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
c00000 +++$+++ Be careful.
c00000 +++$+++ This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
c00000 +++$+++ Shut up!
c00000 +++$+++ Stu Miley.
c00000 +++$+++ Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
c00000 +++$+++ It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
c00000 +++$+++ It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, there is goes.
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ Five years is a long time.
c00000 +++$+++ I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
c00000 +++$+++ You're not finished here?
c00000 +++$+++ She did?
c00000 +++$+++ What happend to you?
c00000 +++$+++ You love sharks?
c00000 +++$+++ I ain't playin' that.
c00000 +++$+++ You sound as if you hate it.
c00000 +++$+++ I always said you were a gentleman.
c00000 +++$+++ That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
c00000 +++$+++ Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
c00000 +++$+++ It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
c00000 +++$+++ What odds?
c00000 +++$+++ ...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
c00000 +++$+++ Like big lizards.
c00000 +++$+++ Now, we're informed that you have a statement you'd like to read, is that correct?
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ I... found that rock.
c00000 +++$+++ But, Faith--
c00000 +++$+++ I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
c00000 +++$+++ Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
c00000 +++$+++ I thought it was inspired.
c00000 +++$+++ It's all about the money, isn't it?
c00000 +++$+++ Cut the crap, X, I saw you down there. You're a hero. Don't be afraid to join the good guys.
c00000 +++$+++ -- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
c00000 +++$+++ Rather more than a little something, Mr. Mitchell.
c00000 +++$+++ I only want one.
c00000 +++$+++ "It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
c00000 +++$+++ Ernie, dump him in a cab.  Around the corner.  Tiffany, you help him.  I'll destroy his file and refund his money.  And if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of Douglas Quaid.
c00000 +++$+++ Was I ever of use?
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you.
c00000 +++$+++ You'll never change -- will you?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>...
c00000 +++$+++ No.  I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that.  I really liked her.
c00000 +++$+++ Thought you might find that.
c00000 +++$+++ What do they want you or?
c00000 +++$+++ Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
c00000 +++$+++ Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
c00000 +++$+++ You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
c00000 +++$+++ Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
c00000 +++$+++ I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
c00000 +++$+++ I was afraid of that.
c00000 +++$+++ Killaine...
c00000 +++$+++ I don't think it's negative five.
c00000 +++$+++ How's our deal coming along?
c00000 +++$+++ She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
c00000 +++$+++ You coming to South America?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, there are as many as one wants.
c00000 +++$+++ I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
c00000 +++$+++ Put me down for Thursday again.
c00000 +++$+++ The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
c00000 +++$+++ If that worked, you would've done it already. No, you want me to drink it of my own free will. Well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before I fall for that one again.
c00000 +++$+++ You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
c00000 +++$+++ No, I have a cat.
c00000 +++$+++ We have to have a long talk about all this.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
c00000 +++$+++ Thanks.
c00000 +++$+++ Why not make them happy?
c00000 +++$+++ It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
c00000 +++$+++ What is he?
c00000 +++$+++ Fire insurance!
c00000 +++$+++ You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
c00000 +++$+++ What are you babbling about?
c00000 +++$+++ You bullshittin' me?
c00000 +++$+++ What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
c00000 +++$+++ You did?
c00000 +++$+++ We thought maybe you'd have that kind of information for us.
c00000 +++$+++ What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
c00000 +++$+++ You know me home.  Me name.
c00000 +++$+++ At the expense of six people.
c00000 +++$+++ When do you deliver your project?
c00000 +++$+++ Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
c00000 +++$+++ But Richardson?
c00000 +++$+++ But...Why?
c00000 +++$+++ You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
c00000 +++$+++ I understand.
c00000 +++$+++ And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
c00000 +++$+++ What about you?
c00000 +++$+++ I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
c00000 +++$+++ She showed me a drawing.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
c00000 +++$+++ No, I don't think so.  Leave me alone, give me money.  That's what I get from our daughter.  She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
c00000 +++$+++ What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
c00000 +++$+++ Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
c00000 +++$+++ But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
c00000 +++$+++ If you have some, I'd...
c00000 +++$+++ What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
c00000 +++$+++ Paul, this will be our legacy.
c00000 +++$+++ Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't puss out.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
c00000 +++$+++ Why should I?
c00000 +++$+++ So what? You going to help me?
c00000 +++$+++ Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
c00000 +++$+++ What's up?
c00000 +++$+++ Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers.  You want tickets?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
c00000 +++$+++ Just one thing.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
c00000 +++$+++ That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
c00000 +++$+++ Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
c00000 +++$+++ Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
c00000 +++$+++ The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
c00000 +++$+++ The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
c00000 +++$+++ I want you to hurt me.
c00000 +++$+++ Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
c00000 +++$+++ I get it. We could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. Brilliant!!
c00000 +++$+++ Died there?  How?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
c00000 +++$+++ What's he doing up here?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.  What's your theory?
c00000 +++$+++ Black market?
c00000 +++$+++ I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
c00000 +++$+++ Bully for you.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
c00000 +++$+++ We could, if I'm not in jail.
c00000 +++$+++ Of course he...
c00000 +++$+++ Still, it must be kinda rough.
c00000 +++$+++ Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
c00000 +++$+++ That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
c00000 +++$+++ But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
c00000 +++$+++ Where'd she go?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
c00000 +++$+++ On a good run... yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ Traps shut!
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
c00000 +++$+++ Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, sure, Mick.
c00000 +++$+++ You tell her, Max.  Come on, do her that favor.  Tell her there isn't going to be any picture -- there aren't any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't know that.
c00000 +++$+++ It's no big deal.
c00000 +++$+++ Where are you going?
c00000 +++$+++ You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ You okay?
c00000 +++$+++ If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
c00000 +++$+++ So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
c00000 +++$+++ You're kidding me.
c00000 +++$+++ A hammock?
c00000 +++$+++ It hurts too much.
c00000 +++$+++ You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
c00000 +++$+++ How much?
c00000 +++$+++ Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
c00000 +++$+++ But is she gonna be okay?
c00000 +++$+++ How come I didn't hear anything?
c00000 +++$+++ That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll tell him someone else told me.
c00000 +++$+++ You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
c00000 +++$+++ You'll have to find that out, won't you.
c00000 +++$+++ He didn't tell me you was a fuck- up, either.  You played the Big Con since then.
c00000 +++$+++ When?
c00000 +++$+++ He's not in, Sir.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you mean that?
c00000 +++$+++ Can I feel 'em?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
c00000 +++$+++ "Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
c00000 +++$+++ No thanks... .
c00000 +++$+++ Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ That woman!
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
c00000 +++$+++ They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
c00000 +++$+++ Just wait there for me!
c00000 +++$+++ I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
c00000 +++$+++ In the morning.
c00000 +++$+++ Playing.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
c00000 +++$+++ Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
c00000 +++$+++ He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
c00000 +++$+++ I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
c00000 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c00000 +++$+++ Immigration Officer?
c00000 +++$+++ Patient.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know what to say to him.  I can't.
c00000 +++$+++ A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
c00000 +++$+++ The point is, if you unplug me when I'm flatlines, I'm history. I got no way back.
c00000 +++$+++ Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
c00000 +++$+++ What does that mean?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected -
c00000 +++$+++ You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
c00000 +++$+++ Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
c00000 +++$+++ You carry a piece? You need one?
c00000 +++$+++ Twenty-eight.
c00000 +++$+++ Me?
c00000 +++$+++ Who cares!
c00000 +++$+++ Which one?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm promised to another!
c00000 +++$+++ No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
c00000 +++$+++ You seem very sure about that.
c00000 +++$+++ How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
c00000 +++$+++ Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
c00000 +++$+++ A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
c00000 +++$+++ ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
c00000 +++$+++ I saw you talking to my Mom.
c00000 +++$+++ Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
c00000 +++$+++ You're kidding.
c00000 +++$+++ So you were cheated.
c00000 +++$+++ I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
c00000 +++$+++ Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
c00000 +++$+++ It was just great!
c00000 +++$+++ You want me to scooch over next to you?
c00000 +++$+++ No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
c00000 +++$+++ Four hundred cases worth.  Well?
c00000 +++$+++ What did he do?
c00000 +++$+++ You have a problem?
c00000 +++$+++ Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body --
c00000 +++$+++ Yes...fine.
c00000 +++$+++ We're having a party for you, boy. Cake and shish-k-bob, just like you love. Junior cringes away from the light.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't forget anything, do you?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Walter.
c00000 +++$+++ You are.
c00000 +++$+++ Then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
c00000 +++$+++ We've still got to find the mainframe.
c00000 +++$+++ Uh...sure...I...what?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, "Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study.
c00000 +++$+++ What are you going to do, Rose?
c00000 +++$+++ I know.
c00000 +++$+++ Would you cool it already?
c00000 +++$+++ That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live --- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
c00000 +++$+++ You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Drive through it!
c00000 +++$+++ Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh yeah, how?
c00000 +++$+++ No. You don't.
c00000 +++$+++ You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
c00000 +++$+++ You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
c00000 +++$+++ This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
c00000 +++$+++ I know. I just got it.  It was very funny.
c00000 +++$+++ I mean I can't tell you.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes! That never occurred to me.  Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  Gus, my friend, you're a genius. Okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
c00000 +++$+++ We're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
c00000 +++$+++ Thanks.
c00000 +++$+++ Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
c00000 +++$+++ I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
c00000 +++$+++ This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
c00000 +++$+++ No, it hasn't.
c00000 +++$+++ Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
c00000 +++$+++ Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't see --
c00000 +++$+++ Have you worked here long?
c00000 +++$+++ We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
c00000 +++$+++ I think you oughta read it to her.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm glad Bill's back.
c00000 +++$+++ Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
c00000 +++$+++ Good hunting. Hayes out.
c00000 +++$+++ Check at six minutes.
c00000 +++$+++ That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
c00000 +++$+++ The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
c00000 +++$+++ Leia! Leia's my sister.
c00000 +++$+++ These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
c00000 +++$+++ Okay. Good-bye.
c00000 +++$+++ That way it sets.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.
c00000 +++$+++ Like what? Be a rock star?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
c00000 +++$+++ I don't want you drinking, Frances.
c00000 +++$+++ We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
c00000 +++$+++ I thought she was splendid!
c00000 +++$+++ Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
c00000 +++$+++ Who's Baxter?
c00000 +++$+++ All right then.
c00000 +++$+++ What happened?
c00000 +++$+++ Forget it.
c00000 +++$+++ A what?
c00000 +++$+++ I have your fucking family.  Don't forget that.
c00000 +++$+++ Swear on my life.
c00000 +++$+++ We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
c00000 +++$+++ Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
c00000 +++$+++ We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
c00000 +++$+++ If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
c00000 +++$+++ At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
c00000 +++$+++ So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
c00000 +++$+++ NOOO!
c00000 +++$+++ Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you take cocaine, Irene?
c00000 +++$+++ Kind of.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure. Good-by.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
c00000 +++$+++ What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
c00000 +++$+++ Show me again...
c00000 +++$+++ Don't lay this on me!
c00000 +++$+++ I was.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
c00000 +++$+++ Ah, go on, you swine.
c00000 +++$+++ What kind of opinions?
c00000 +++$+++ Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
c00000 +++$+++ And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
c00000 +++$+++ Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
c00000 +++$+++ That only leaves three.
c00000 +++$+++ How can you be sure?
c00000 +++$+++ Now is not a time. What time do you close.
c00000 +++$+++ You got it.
c00000 +++$+++ Always.
c00000 +++$+++ Shhhh.
c00000 +++$+++ Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
c00000 +++$+++ What is it?
c00000 +++$+++ He is my father.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
c00000 +++$+++ You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
c00000 +++$+++ You're kidding.
c00000 +++$+++ So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
c00000 +++$+++ Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
c00000 +++$+++ You made me look like an idiot --
c00000 +++$+++ No more than the usual.
c00000 +++$+++ You didn't count it?
c00000 +++$+++ How many you killed, Kid?
c00000 +++$+++ He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not appealing the decision.
c00000 +++$+++ Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
c00000 +++$+++ Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
c00000 +++$+++ You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
c00000 +++$+++ God defeated the English, not me.
c00000 +++$+++ Is something wrong?
c00000 +++$+++ But that's not the point...
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
c00000 +++$+++ You and Verona?
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ We're a team.  We work together.
c00000 +++$+++ ... But we shouldn't have fired him...
c00000 +++$+++ We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
c00000 +++$+++ I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
c00000 +++$+++ I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
c00000 +++$+++ In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
c00000 +++$+++ What's still there?
c00000 +++$+++ They used to. Today it's not an issue.
c00000 +++$+++ What did you say your name is?
c00000 +++$+++ I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
c00000 +++$+++ Who is she? Where does she live?
c00000 +++$+++ Wes--
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm looking for a great warrior.
c00000 +++$+++ He was very ill, I stayed with him for a while.
c00000 +++$+++ And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
c00000 +++$+++ Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
c00000 +++$+++ Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
c00000 +++$+++ You lived there. You know the city.
c00000 +++$+++ My father-in-law, he's the owner.
c00000 +++$+++ You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
c00000 +++$+++ He's on the telephone.
c00000 +++$+++ But recent events have been so dramatic, it does raise the perennial question. What keeps us watching this one man twenty-four hours a day - eating, sleeping, working, sitting for hours in contemplation?
c00000 +++$+++ ... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
c00000 +++$+++ I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  How do you know?
c00000 +++$+++ Did you warn her?
c00000 +++$+++ Ten minutes...
c00000 +++$+++ Do you know that for sure?
c00000 +++$+++ Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
c00000 +++$+++ You told him that?
c00000 +++$+++ But you'll never be whole again.
c00000 +++$+++ Can't you give it to me later?
c00000 +++$+++ This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
c00000 +++$+++ So it seems. May we be serious for a moment?
c00000 +++$+++ Seen what, sir..?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
c00000 +++$+++ You get Hardy.
c00000 +++$+++ What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
c00000 +++$+++ How'd you guess?
c00000 +++$+++ Are you Peter Venkman?
c00000 +++$+++ Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
c00000 +++$+++ No, my friend knows her.
c00000 +++$+++ Who?  Who is he?  What is he?
c00000 +++$+++ Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
c00000 +++$+++ Sure!
c00000 +++$+++ You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
c00000 +++$+++ "Octopus people?"
c00000 +++$+++ You want me to hold the chicken.
c00000 +++$+++ It's a romantic and tragic drink.
c00000 +++$+++ You doin' anything tonight?
c00000 +++$+++ I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
c00000 +++$+++ As well as can be expected, I guess. Give me the bad news.
c00000 +++$+++ It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
c00000 +++$+++ Keith's hot.
c00000 +++$+++ We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
c00000 +++$+++ You weren't a paper champion.
c00000 +++$+++ You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home.
c00000 +++$+++ Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
c00000 +++$+++ Altar boys?
c00000 +++$+++ Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ Been here long?
c00000 +++$+++ Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what would've happened if you hadn't stepped in at the store.
c00000 +++$+++ Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
c00000 +++$+++ Jack.
c00000 +++$+++ I think you should go now.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
c00000 +++$+++ Twenty months?
c00000 +++$+++ I know that answer.  If we went to trial would we win?
c00000 +++$+++ Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
c00000 +++$+++ From the grave?
c00000 +++$+++ Where are you, Mulder?
c00000 +++$+++ To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
c00000 +++$+++ Afraid so.
c00000 +++$+++ You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
c00000 +++$+++ The nocturnal flying mammal?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.
c00000 +++$+++ Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
c00000 +++$+++ And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
c00000 +++$+++ Hey!
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
c00000 +++$+++ Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
c00000 +++$+++ You flatter me.
c00000 +++$+++ Then start taking them seriously.
c00000 +++$+++ Now you're back.
c00000 +++$+++ So don't show a picture.
c00000 +++$+++ He was a cool one, that Harper. Never broke.
c00000 +++$+++ With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm scared. Three kids are dead. I want to go to this party.
c00000 +++$+++ You said, first, he was lying.  How do you know that, Doctor?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay. Go ahead, but you better keep movin'.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
c00000 +++$+++ You're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
c00000 +++$+++ What's your name?
c00000 +++$+++ What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
c00000 +++$+++ All right, I'm lying. Don't forget you called me a liar.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
c00000 +++$+++ Woman friends, too?
c00000 +++$+++ Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
c00000 +++$+++ How much?
c00000 +++$+++ Trust me, you're the best.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off.
c00000 +++$+++ What if I were to say "Your Wife"-- as in does she know of your touching mentor-student relationship with the post-Bicentennial babe working the roulette wheel?
c00000 +++$+++ Gotta go, Arletta.
c00000 +++$+++ Just one... why me?
c00000 +++$+++ It means shut up, Thelma.
c00000 +++$+++ With pay!  She is out the door.
c00000 +++$+++ This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
c00000 +++$+++ To run last?
c00000 +++$+++ That's my business.
c00000 +++$+++ But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
c00000 +++$+++ Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, the sun just came up again, and it seems the wind's died down. It's as clear as a bell outside. There's something I think you ought to see.
c00000 +++$+++ I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
c00000 +++$+++ Who?
c00000 +++$+++ No -- we're going to attack the termites!
c00000 +++$+++ Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
c00000 +++$+++ We've got to get out of here.
c00000 +++$+++ Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
c00000 +++$+++ But my voices... they promised me...
c00000 +++$+++ Ah-hh, no.
c00000 +++$+++ Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
c00000 +++$+++ Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
c00000 +++$+++ No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
c00000 +++$+++ What people?
c00000 +++$+++ Wh-wh-wh-wh...
c00000 +++$+++ Cold.
c00000 +++$+++ What are you talking about? You should get a fucking Academy Award for the Shill work you do.  We got it down cold, Al. You don't want to jinx it by changing something up, do you?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
c00000 +++$+++ Senor, you need a doctor.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ Brian.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
c00000 +++$+++ If I'd stayed down there, maybe this wouldn't've happened.
c00000 +++$+++ No killing?
c00000 +++$+++ Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ You didn't answer my question.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, yes. I heard.
c00000 +++$+++ And they tell me I'm paranoid.
c00000 +++$+++ No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
c00000 +++$+++ They killed her.  And they're trying to buy it...
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay.
c00000 +++$+++ Making love is like.
c00000 +++$+++ She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
c00000 +++$+++ So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
c00000 +++$+++ I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh shit.  Harry... what're you doing?
c00000 +++$+++ There's no reason.
c00000 +++$+++ Is it enough?
c00000 +++$+++ But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
c00000 +++$+++ Twenty eight years ago.
c00000 +++$+++ No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
c00000 +++$+++ What responsibilities?
c00000 +++$+++ Still...
c00000 +++$+++ It must be done right away.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  I might not have been shot.
c00000 +++$+++ The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
c00000 +++$+++ Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
c00000 +++$+++ You can't take a guess for another two hours?
c00000 +++$+++ He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
c00000 +++$+++ That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
c00000 +++$+++ You down with the boost?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay.
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ He's watching the other door.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't owe me no nothing.
c00000 +++$+++ It's been a while since...
c00000 +++$+++ Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
c00000 +++$+++ You were taken for a buggy ride?
c00000 +++$+++ What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
c00000 +++$+++ What's his rent?
c00000 +++$+++ What kind of concerns?
c00000 +++$+++ I guess so, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ You're the asshole, buddy.
c00000 +++$+++ Like, normal style.  The...missionary position.
c00000 +++$+++ Because she's visiting me.
c00000 +++$+++ What are you in for, Willie?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't see how that plan's any better.
c00000 +++$+++ You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
c00000 +++$+++ You think he's lying?
c00000 +++$+++ It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
c00000 +++$+++ I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
c00000 +++$+++ Your life.
c00000 +++$+++ What's that, peanut?
c00000 +++$+++ Colon cancer.
c00000 +++$+++ That would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  You'd be violating every fire regulation on the books.  We'll guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  One more question.  I see a big hole.  If this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
c00000 +++$+++ Whoa.
c00000 +++$+++ She mentioned, of course, that Margo expects to play the part?
c00000 +++$+++ That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
c00000 +++$+++ You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
c00000 +++$+++ You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
c00000 +++$+++ Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
c00000 +++$+++ And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
c00000 +++$+++ You're right... I don't.  I just need to know that this thing is out of here!  You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh --
c00000 +++$+++ Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
c00000 +++$+++ I've met you before.
c00000 +++$+++ No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
c00000 +++$+++ Got my hands full here.
c00000 +++$+++ Then don't.
c00000 +++$+++ Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
c00000 +++$+++ -- All I know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.
c00000 +++$+++ What?! You're calling me a stalker?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
c00000 +++$+++ When I was alive, they were the things nightmares were made of.
c00000 +++$+++ I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
c00000 +++$+++ Did he know?
c00000 +++$+++ The end.
c00000 +++$+++ I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
c00000 +++$+++ I hope to go up next year.
c00000 +++$+++ Not much.
c00000 +++$+++ Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
c00000 +++$+++ And that's what you've heard?
c00000 +++$+++ ... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ We can't change what's past. Not even the war can do that.
c00000 +++$+++ And you're not going to tell me more?
c00000 +++$+++ Dumont! Where's Yori? Where's Flynn?
c00000 +++$+++ They hack into people's programs?
c00000 +++$+++ Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
c00000 +++$+++ Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
c00000 +++$+++ You cannot marry Wessex!
c00000 +++$+++ It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
c00000 +++$+++ None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
c00000 +++$+++ He's my friend. He's not a moron.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know...
c00000 +++$+++ You need the words?
c00000 +++$+++ Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
c00000 +++$+++ a "pond," or
c00000 +++$+++ Happy birthday.
c00000 +++$+++ I see...
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.
c00000 +++$+++ So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
c00000 +++$+++ You didn't have to beat him up!
c00000 +++$+++ That's just so embarrassing.
c00000 +++$+++ Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
c00000 +++$+++ You saved my life.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, I do, it's very good.
c00000 +++$+++ I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
c00000 +++$+++ Because I live there.
c00000 +++$+++ Got anyplace special in mind?
c00000 +++$+++ But why?
c00000 +++$+++ You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
c00000 +++$+++ It's all mine.
c00000 +++$+++ I mean I appreciate that.
c00000 +++$+++ Let Billie finish.
c00000 +++$+++ Does it say anything on the tape?
c00000 +++$+++ I need help with her.
c00000 +++$+++ A porco?
c00000 +++$+++ Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
c00000 +++$+++ Why did he come out here? What's going on?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
c00000 +++$+++ I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
c00000 +++$+++ Triplets.
c00000 +++$+++ It does to me.
c00000 +++$+++ You think it will?
c00000 +++$+++ Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
c00000 +++$+++ The early bird gets the damn worm.
c00000 +++$+++ No, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
c00000 +++$+++ Here!  In the car!
c00000 +++$+++ Positive.
c00000 +++$+++ I want to help you.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure. This girl said...
c00000 +++$+++ All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
c00000 +++$+++ Gotta go.
c00000 +++$+++ I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
c00000 +++$+++ ...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
c00000 +++$+++ I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
c00000 +++$+++ It's because I'm shy, Betty.  So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
c00000 +++$+++ That's his brother.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Guess I'm not a single type guy.
c00000 +++$+++ Michael....
c00000 +++$+++ No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
c00000 +++$+++ Who does?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, let's go.
c00000 +++$+++ Ida Sessions.
c00000 +++$+++ I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
c00000 +++$+++ I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
c00000 +++$+++ "Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
c00000 +++$+++ Now you're talking!  We pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves Josephine and Geraldine -
c00000 +++$+++ I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
c00000 +++$+++ You want to go back in?
c00000 +++$+++ And a right.
c00000 +++$+++ ... Sex.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you believe it?
c00000 +++$+++ Chum?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
c00000 +++$+++ No. Just the cross streets.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
c00000 +++$+++ The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
c00000 +++$+++ ...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
c00000 +++$+++ I hate him.
c00000 +++$+++ PROBABLY going.
c00000 +++$+++ Would you? I'd feel so much better.
c00000 +++$+++ And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
c00000 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c00000 +++$+++ Anna...
c00000 +++$+++ Right here. A minute ago.
c00000 +++$+++ The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
c00000 +++$+++ Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
c00000 +++$+++ Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
c00000 +++$+++ Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
c00000 +++$+++ Which ones?
c00000 +++$+++ What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
c00000 +++$+++ But what about this?
c00000 +++$+++ What other case?
c00000 +++$+++ When I was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. There are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.
c00000 +++$+++ It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
c00000 +++$+++ Hah! You don't know me, boy.
c00000 +++$+++ Like love?
c00000 +++$+++ You mean you don't know?
c00000 +++$+++ Do I hear a motion seconded?
c00000 +++$+++ Where are you at least?
c00000 +++$+++ He'll be really mad.
c00000 +++$+++ Dream?!
c00000 +++$+++ If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
c00000 +++$+++ Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
c00000 +++$+++ You're staying here.  Some of them might not come after me.  If they don't this place is gonna turn into a total stain.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
c00000 +++$+++ You.
c00000 +++$+++ Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
c00000 +++$+++ All right if I look around your lobby?
c00000 +++$+++ Then why isn't there anyone around?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  Absolutely.
c00000 +++$+++ But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
c00000 +++$+++ Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. - DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
c00000 +++$+++ Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
c00000 +++$+++ He certainly could. About a month.
c00000 +++$+++ Now that is a lie!  See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet!  When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William!  Do you hear?  You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
c00000 +++$+++ I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
c00000 +++$+++ Out getting coffee.
c00000 +++$+++ He's a big one.
c00000 +++$+++ Want to talk about it?
c00000 +++$+++ For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
c00000 +++$+++ You share dreams?  That's incredible.
c00000 +++$+++ Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
c00000 +++$+++ I know that.
c00000 +++$+++ And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
c00000 +++$+++ No.  You said, "Do something."  Who were you talking to?  Tell me!
c00000 +++$+++ Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
c00000 +++$+++ And what did you say?
c00000 +++$+++ You're him. Corvis.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
c00000 +++$+++ Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
c00000 +++$+++ Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
c00000 +++$+++ Three.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
c00000 +++$+++ S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
c00000 +++$+++ You need to get out more.
c00000 +++$+++ What for?
c00000 +++$+++ I think we should do something with strong female characters...
c00000 +++$+++ I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
c00000 +++$+++ She's supposed to have it.
c00000 +++$+++ It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
c00000 +++$+++ See you? He can smell you from there.
c00000 +++$+++ He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
c00000 +++$+++ I ain't heard of nothin'.
c00000 +++$+++ You are...
c00000 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c00000 +++$+++ Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
c00000 +++$+++ You did miss --
c00000 +++$+++ No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
c00000 +++$+++ Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
c00000 +++$+++ No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
c00000 +++$+++ What you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
c00000 +++$+++ This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
c00000 +++$+++ But my own kid bro--
c00000 +++$+++ He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him.
c00000 +++$+++ He only weighs ten ounces --
c00000 +++$+++ Do you like me even a little bit?
c00000 +++$+++ What was the bottle that did it?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
c00000 +++$+++ You're lucky I am not wasting you.
c00000 +++$+++ Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
c00000 +++$+++ Really.
c00000 +++$+++ When I die.  Is it gonna hurt?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
c00000 +++$+++ You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
c00000 +++$+++ In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
c00000 +++$+++ Please, get the hell out of here.
c00000 +++$+++ Unless what?
c00000 +++$+++ He's dead, you know.
c00000 +++$+++ Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
c00000 +++$+++ Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ No. Doesn't that suck?
c00000 +++$+++ I can't feel my body.
c00000 +++$+++ Who do you think could've done this?
c00000 +++$+++ You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
c00000 +++$+++ I don't find this "turning the tables" thing very interesting --
c00000 +++$+++ What d'you tell her?
c00000 +++$+++ Nothing. I'm fine.
c00000 +++$+++ My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
c00000 +++$+++ If he had no idea, why did the Jews need saving? This is the question, Emmi, to all Germans: Why did the Jews need saving in this country? Why, if people had no idea?
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
c00000 +++$+++ Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
c00000 +++$+++ Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
c00000 +++$+++ One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ Wow.
c00000 +++$+++ It was good.  He was a hard worker, a lot of drive, a real hustler.
c00000 +++$+++ Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
c00000 +++$+++ 'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
c00000 +++$+++ Hello, Niagara.
c00000 +++$+++ Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
c00000 +++$+++ I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
c00000 +++$+++ What's Liddy got?
c00000 +++$+++ Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
c00000 +++$+++ We know these people...!
c00000 +++$+++ I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
c00000 +++$+++ Has someone seen to those bruises?
c00000 +++$+++ Is that how Larry feels?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I dunno.  I mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
c00000 +++$+++ That's not his apartment.
c00000 +++$+++ What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
c00000 +++$+++ And what?
c00000 +++$+++ None of your business.  God.
c00000 +++$+++ They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
c00000 +++$+++ See you.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry.
c00000 +++$+++ The Anti-Christ?
c00000 +++$+++ Edward.  My name is Edward.
c00000 +++$+++ What's the matter?
c00000 +++$+++ I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! Eddie, what am I gonna do?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't think so.
c00000 +++$+++ She's gotten worse, Father. She won't eat, she won't talk. The child won't even let me touch her.
c00000 +++$+++ The cost-efficient reporter.
c00000 +++$+++ Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
c00000 +++$+++ Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
c00000 +++$+++ What about her?
c00000 +++$+++ It's just...
c00000 +++$+++ I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
c00000 +++$+++ Double-meaning intended --
c00000 +++$+++ -- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
c00000 +++$+++ It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
c00000 +++$+++ Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
c00000 +++$+++ You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
c00000 +++$+++ What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
c00000 +++$+++ -- Well what am I supposed to call you?
c00000 +++$+++ Deal.
c00000 +++$+++ No, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, it's wonderful.
c00000 +++$+++ Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
c00000 +++$+++ People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, come on.
c00000 +++$+++ But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
c00000 +++$+++ No, I mean - about my client.
c00000 +++$+++ I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
c00000 +++$+++ It's engineered to last about fifteen years.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, you know, not all Algerians speak French. It's a matter of what school you went too. Me I never really --
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe she used another name.
c00000 +++$+++ Kinship. And what's here?
c00000 +++$+++ The songs on the radio.  But wait.  I don't understand.  Why is this even happening to me?
c00000 +++$+++ You planning to do anything about it?
c00000 +++$+++ Who?
c00000 +++$+++ Fuckus my assus. They did some number on you.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll take you... why not?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
c00000 +++$+++ So will you?
c00000 +++$+++ What do you mean? You're Rita.
c00000 +++$+++ I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
c00000 +++$+++ You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, yeah?
c00000 +++$+++ I need two hundred and fifty grand.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ There are fucking coyotes out there.
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you... I'm sorry you had to lie.  It must have been difficult.
c00000 +++$+++ I could stay and go.
c00000 +++$+++ No, it isn't what I think.
c00000 +++$+++ The party's over.
c00000 +++$+++ But you said --
c00000 +++$+++ Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
c00000 +++$+++ If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare--I--when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
c00000 +++$+++ I have a few more questions to ask her.
c00000 +++$+++ There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest response, I can't help you.  I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.
c00000 +++$+++ Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
c00000 +++$+++ Might we watch, too?
c00000 +++$+++ I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
c00000 +++$+++ Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
c00000 +++$+++ No such thing, old buddy. It's a one way ticket. Once we cross that border, we're on our own.
c00000 +++$+++ Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
c00000 +++$+++ Thanks.
c00000 +++$+++ I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
c00000 +++$+++ He did sometimes.
c00000 +++$+++ Right. Wait. A toast.
c00000 +++$+++ And what do you do when you wake up to that?
c00000 +++$+++ So you do know her.
c00000 +++$+++ Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
c00000 +++$+++ How did you end up on Remus?
c00000 +++$+++ The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
c00000 +++$+++ No, I'm alone.
c00000 +++$+++ I heard that was you.
c00000 +++$+++ You hear me? I believed you.
c00000 +++$+++ Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
c00000 +++$+++ And a slice of pecan pie, right?
c00000 +++$+++ Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
c00000 +++$+++ That ain't right.
c00000 +++$+++ Sean...
c00000 +++$+++ I know I am. Why, I even heard a shot up there last night.
c00000 +++$+++ What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
c00000 +++$+++ Fifty thousand dollars!
c00000 +++$+++ What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
c00000 +++$+++ Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
c00000 +++$+++ Nowt.
c00000 +++$+++ I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
c00000 +++$+++ Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
c00000 +++$+++ That's ridiculous.
c00000 +++$+++ Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
c00000 +++$+++ You're slowing.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
c00000 +++$+++ You never had it.
c00000 +++$+++ Toss you for it.
c00000 +++$+++ Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
c00000 +++$+++ It's three thousand dollars!
c00000 +++$+++ I've never met him?
c00000 +++$+++ Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
c00000 +++$+++ Please.
c00000 +++$+++ BREAKING OUT
c00000 +++$+++ Can we buy the Marshal some dinner?
c00000 +++$+++ So am I.
c00000 +++$+++ I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
c00000 +++$+++ But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
c00000 +++$+++ Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
c00000 +++$+++ Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
c00000 +++$+++ Huh?
c00000 +++$+++ Will you let me ask you some questions?
c00000 +++$+++ If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
c00000 +++$+++ I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
c00000 +++$+++ How long have you been downtown?
c00000 +++$+++ I'll call you.
c00000 +++$+++ How many sharks have you killed?
c00000 +++$+++ I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
c00000 +++$+++ It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
c00000 +++$+++ No I'm not.
c00000 +++$+++ So which one caught your eye?
c00000 +++$+++ I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
c00000 +++$+++ A nice, big cock.
c00000 +++$+++ Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home.
c00000 +++$+++ Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
c00000 +++$+++ Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
c00000 +++$+++ It's bullshit.  Everything. My job, the people I get involved with, I'm up to here with it.
c00000 +++$+++ No...  You want me to give him a message?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
c00000 +++$+++ Sally?
c00000 +++$+++ No it's not.
c00000 +++$+++ No...I'm not...
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you.
c00000 +++$+++ I guess so. Then what happened?
c00000 +++$+++ Wait a second--
c00000 +++$+++ How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
c00000 +++$+++ You do?
c00000 +++$+++ Good night.
c00000 +++$+++ What is that?
c00000 +++$+++ For real?
c00000 +++$+++ Tell me.
c00000 +++$+++ What are you talking about?  You love your job.
c00000 +++$+++ He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
c00000 +++$+++ Then we're screwed.
c00000 +++$+++ That's right.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
c00000 +++$+++ How 'bout Mallory?
c00000 +++$+++ What's okay?
c00000 +++$+++ You want me to move?
c00000 +++$+++ The hospital?
c00000 +++$+++ You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
c00000 +++$+++ Harry... I met someone.
c00000 +++$+++ What else did she tell you?
c00000 +++$+++ I wasn't going to try anything.
c00000 +++$+++ It won't last, believe me. And you, when will you go back to the States?
c00000 +++$+++ It will grow back again!
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
c00000 +++$+++ So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
c00000 +++$+++ What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, that's how Hams work.
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
c00000 +++$+++ You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
c00000 +++$+++ Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet--  --thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
c00000 +++$+++ We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
c00000 +++$+++ Really?
c00000 +++$+++ I have to go away, John.
c00000 +++$+++ And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
c00000 +++$+++ Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
c00000 +++$+++ Then what's going on?
c00000 +++$+++ Why is that?
c00000 +++$+++ I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
c00000 +++$+++ No. No you're not.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
c00000 +++$+++ I still feel like shit.
c00000 +++$+++ And don't forget. I have the key.
c00000 +++$+++ Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
c00000 +++$+++ Shit.
c00000 +++$+++ Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin' no shit. It's my money, I can do whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know anything that isn't police business.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
c00000 +++$+++ Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
c00000 +++$+++ Fresh goat's milk.
c00000 +++$+++ Why not?
c00000 +++$+++ You won't even tell us?
c00000 +++$+++ True enough.
c00000 +++$+++ An anti-psychotic...
c00000 +++$+++ I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
c00000 +++$+++ --Well, maybe that means you.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
c00000 +++$+++ Presently, Mr. Preysing.
c00000 +++$+++ A neighbor saw your car leave.
c00000 +++$+++ ...Yeah. But two's enough not to look anxious...
c00000 +++$+++ And what's he do?
c00000 +++$+++ Shit. I knew you were crazy.
c00000 +++$+++ We don't need a warrant if it's a riot.
c00000 +++$+++ Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
c00000 +++$+++ Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
c00000 +++$+++ A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
c00000 +++$+++ Don't know what?
c00000 +++$+++ It's too much machine for you.
c00000 +++$+++ Fine. Thank you, Mr. Franklin.
c00000 +++$+++ Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
c00000 +++$+++ Just one. Why is this floor so short?
c00000 +++$+++ You're the one who started running.
c00000 +++$+++ Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
c00000 +++$+++ I... I don't know...
c00000 +++$+++ It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
c00000 +++$+++ Who do?
c00000 +++$+++ I've made the scene.
c00000 +++$+++ Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
c00000 +++$+++ Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
c00000 +++$+++ Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
c00000 +++$+++ Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
c00000 +++$+++ It's interesting.
c00000 +++$+++ A what?
c00000 +++$+++ Where the hell are you?
c00000 +++$+++ What is it Miles?
c00000 +++$+++ You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
c00000 +++$+++ Huh?
c00000 +++$+++ I said it was bad judgment!  What else do you want me to say?
c00000 +++$+++ Fine. How's everything going?
c00000 +++$+++ I dunno..
c00000 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c00000 +++$+++ Wellllll, if you read it it must be true. Was it in the Star, or the Enquirer?
c00000 +++$+++ You did?
c00000 +++$+++ Not since you lost him.
c00000 +++$+++ That game was before you was born.
c00000 +++$+++ I have a surprise for you.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
c00000 +++$+++ I know that.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you like it?
c00000 +++$+++ He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
c00000 +++$+++ We just can.
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ Off me or off you?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm confused.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't talk to me about character.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
c00000 +++$+++ Really?
c00000 +++$+++ I know.
c00000 +++$+++ A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
c00000 +++$+++ "Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
c00000 +++$+++ I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
c00000 +++$+++ Could I ask some questions?
c00000 +++$+++ Because I have dreamed of him.  Not as the baby they took away, but as a man.
c00000 +++$+++ Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
c00000 +++$+++ Anything else I should know?
c00000 +++$+++ They'll mend.
c00000 +++$+++ No you didn't!
c00000 +++$+++ Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
c00000 +++$+++ Where's the shell?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
c00000 +++$+++ Like you?
c00000 +++$+++ I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
c00000 +++$+++ Now move along.
c00000 +++$+++ This child let loose the beast from its cage --
c00000 +++$+++ A true friend would do it.
c00000 +++$+++ Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
c00000 +++$+++ And I believed you! I oughta punch you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey, let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey, Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do you say? Nick? What do you say?
c00000 +++$+++ How long have you been waiting?
c00000 +++$+++ I hear she's getting real fat.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
c00000 +++$+++ I've never been to Louisville.
c00000 +++$+++ What with?
c00000 +++$+++ That's what we were working on.
c00000 +++$+++ It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
c00000 +++$+++ I am lighten. Can we drop this?
c00000 +++$+++ No, I did not.
c00000 +++$+++ Why would you do that?
c00000 +++$+++ Shall we move closer to the fire?
c00000 +++$+++ Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
c00000 +++$+++ Someone not his wife?
c00000 +++$+++ Needing.
c00000 +++$+++ She's got to meet you-
c00000 +++$+++ Grand Rapids? Of course.
c00000 +++$+++ How could anything be indigenous to this asteroid?  It's dead.
c00000 +++$+++ None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
c00000 +++$+++ You're fucking psycho.
c00000 +++$+++ You have a disease.
c00000 +++$+++ I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
c00000 +++$+++ So?
c00000 +++$+++ You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
c00000 +++$+++ Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
c00000 +++$+++ Bye.
c00000 +++$+++ ... I understand ...
c00000 +++$+++ I happen to be a professional.
c00000 +++$+++ Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
c00000 +++$+++ You're welcome...??
c00000 +++$+++ Because I don't want cancer.
c00000 +++$+++ You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
c00000 +++$+++ We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
c00000 +++$+++ Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
c00000 +++$+++ Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ I feel much better now.
c00000 +++$+++ I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
c00000 +++$+++ Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
c00000 +++$+++ No. Frank.
c00000 +++$+++ You are not a God.
c00000 +++$+++ Nothing.
c00000 +++$+++ You know what happened to the Tower of Babel, don't you? It fell down.
c00000 +++$+++ But then you told her you were home.
c00000 +++$+++ He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
c00000 +++$+++ Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ I love you.
c00000 +++$+++ Son, have a look in his locker.
c00000 +++$+++ Blood and guts.
c00000 +++$+++ Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah. What?
c00000 +++$+++ ...tunnel!
c00000 +++$+++ There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ Would you like to come in?
c00000 +++$+++ But he's been so patient with me, Tatum. You know, with all the sex stuff. How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?
c00000 +++$+++ What do you really think?
c00000 +++$+++ Like an elephant.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know your real name.
c00000 +++$+++ Done.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you mean?
c00000 +++$+++ What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
c00000 +++$+++ Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe we shouldn't.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
c00000 +++$+++ Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
c00000 +++$+++ And what?
c00000 +++$+++ That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
c00000 +++$+++ We don't mess with accessories.
c00000 +++$+++ What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
c00000 +++$+++ A woman should not be out alone in these woods.
c00000 +++$+++ Sort of.
c00000 +++$+++ Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
c00000 +++$+++ ...Something like that. Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh no sir - just making some enquiries...Just tell her that INSPECTOR TAYLOR called on you - she'll understand
c00000 +++$+++ No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ When?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know what I've got.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh yes?
c00000 +++$+++ For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
c00000 +++$+++ No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
c00000 +++$+++ This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
c00000 +++$+++ No... we're together...
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
c00000 +++$+++ Just one.
c00000 +++$+++ ...-m-means, Mason.
c00000 +++$+++ But we are underground?
c00000 +++$+++ She didn't really say.
c00000 +++$+++ But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
c00000 +++$+++ Oh-what a nice outfit!
c00000 +++$+++ It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
c00000 +++$+++ He's not going to leave us.
c00000 +++$+++ I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
c00000 +++$+++ He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
c00000 +++$+++ I want them all.
c00000 +++$+++ If we don't engineer a consistent causality it'll work itself out on its own, and that's almost always worse.  Ellie, according to your physics none of this is possible.  A lot of it you're simply not capable of understanding, not yet.  No offense.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.
c00000 +++$+++ Doug, I can't just leave you!
c00000 +++$+++ No, I can't say that I have.
c00000 +++$+++ And why, please tell us, would you think that?
c00000 +++$+++ The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
c00000 +++$+++ Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing?  Whatever the price?  Isn't that what makes a man?
c00000 +++$+++ That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
c00000 +++$+++ No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
c00000 +++$+++ I bow to your expertise in these matters.
c00000 +++$+++ Sam?
c00000 +++$+++ We all have to be strong, right?
c00000 +++$+++ You play games with me and you're through
c00000 +++$+++ Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside, I'll come in and get ya.  And be hard on him for a while; he's talking money.
c00000 +++$+++ I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
c00000 +++$+++ Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
c00000 +++$+++ An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
c00000 +++$+++ You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm looking for a favor.  I need a map of Iraqi.
c00000 +++$+++ Safety?
c00000 +++$+++ No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
c00000 +++$+++ You have no conception of this, do you?
c00000 +++$+++ Who?
c00000 +++$+++ I think you're right.
c00000 +++$+++ The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
c00000 +++$+++ Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
c00000 +++$+++ Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
c00000 +++$+++ At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
c00000 +++$+++ Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you mean "complete"?
c00000 +++$+++ Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
c00000 +++$+++ Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
c00000 +++$+++ You been in the Majors?
c00000 +++$+++ When, may I ask?
c00000 +++$+++ Hey, how about that!
c00000 +++$+++ I had to ask.  I apologize.
c00000 +++$+++ Leave here.  Don't do this.  I don't want you here.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
c00000 +++$+++ And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
c00000 +++$+++ Why is it -- breaking up?
c00000 +++$+++ That is the most unprofessional --
c00000 +++$+++ You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
c00000 +++$+++ I think you're right, Keith.
c00000 +++$+++ I've been doing a lot of thinking.
c00000 +++$+++ That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
c00000 +++$+++ You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
c00000 +++$+++ What for?
c00000 +++$+++ I always wanted to try that.
c00000 +++$+++ They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
c00000 +++$+++ No food?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah. What do I, uh...
c00000 +++$+++ Don't tell me where to work. I moved to New York to work for Edward Dowd. But I can't believe that Edward Dowd has nothing better to do these days than invoke exalted legal issues to get off guilty little --
c00000 +++$+++ To me? But why?
c00000 +++$+++ I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Two bits.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you have to leave the note?
c00000 +++$+++ I actually know how this works.
c00000 +++$+++ Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
c00000 +++$+++ Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
c00000 +++$+++ What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
c00000 +++$+++ Mine?
c00000 +++$+++ I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
c00000 +++$+++ If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
c00000 +++$+++ My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
c00000 +++$+++ Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
c00000 +++$+++ As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
c00000 +++$+++ Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
c00000 +++$+++ I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
c00000 +++$+++ No means yes.
c00000 +++$+++ I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
c00000 +++$+++ Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
c00000 +++$+++ Sheila?!
c00000 +++$+++ Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
c00000 +++$+++ We need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  There must be some design schematics... blueprints...
c00000 +++$+++ <u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
c00000 +++$+++ Viktor, it's my studio.
c00000 +++$+++ It's the only way.
c00000 +++$+++ And they made the first move?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh -- no sir.
c00000 +++$+++ No offense, Professor Tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
c00000 +++$+++ And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm proud of you, Sam.
c00000 +++$+++ No, my health doesn't allow it.
c00000 +++$+++ He knows where I work.
c00000 +++$+++ Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
c00000 +++$+++ Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
c00000 +++$+++ I can accept that, it comes with the job.
c00000 +++$+++ I thought you were above all that
c00000 +++$+++ You mean... George McCord, the actor?
c00000 +++$+++ Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
c00000 +++$+++ That's good.
c00000 +++$+++ The boy _died_?
c00000 +++$+++ I'll be God damned if you will.
c00000 +++$+++ "Back End" ... count on it.
c00000 +++$+++ Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
c00000 +++$+++ Is it drug related?
c00000 +++$+++ But I... We don't even know each other.
c00000 +++$+++ Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
c00000 +++$+++ 'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
c00000 +++$+++ It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
c00000 +++$+++ Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
c00000 +++$+++ What do they call you, sweety?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
c00000 +++$+++ The best. But we won't need them.
c00000 +++$+++ You're firin' me?
c00000 +++$+++ Throw the third switch!
c00000 +++$+++ If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
c00000 +++$+++ I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
c00000 +++$+++ On Furtwangler.
c00000 +++$+++ You're not...busy?
c00000 +++$+++ Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
c00000 +++$+++ After we eat, Dad.
c00000 +++$+++ An intelligent plan, Mr. Luciano, but listen to me well. It can be ruined in a single careless moment. Keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, Twist, but you know if this blows up, I can't do ya no good downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.
c00000 +++$+++ That is not me.
c00000 +++$+++ You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
c00000 +++$+++ No... but...
c00000 +++$+++ I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Then who's Russell Nash?
c00000 +++$+++ Leave him alone!
c00000 +++$+++ I mean <u>full</u> disclosure.
c00000 +++$+++ He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
c00000 +++$+++ That is idle talk.
c00000 +++$+++ I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
c00000 +++$+++ I just went there for a job.
c00000 +++$+++ That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
c00000 +++$+++ Vermicelli.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  You walking to the subway?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
c00000 +++$+++ No, Linda, you don't understan --
c00000 +++$+++ I-I'll do it.
c00000 +++$+++ Lawyer here?
c00000 +++$+++ Naturally I think so.
c00000 +++$+++ ...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
c00000 +++$+++ ... no.
c00000 +++$+++ Rizzo pull the fucking lever!
c00000 +++$+++ That's where the Mask comes in.
c00000 +++$+++ Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
c00000 +++$+++ What's your name?
c00000 +++$+++ I hope I didn't hear that.
c00000 +++$+++ You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
c00000 +++$+++ I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
c00000 +++$+++ Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
c00000 +++$+++ A sink?
c00000 +++$+++ "Don't write any checks you can't cash."
c00000 +++$+++ And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
c00000 +++$+++ There are monsters...  ...in the gelatin...
c00000 +++$+++ We still talk, though.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
c00000 +++$+++ How much longer?
c00000 +++$+++ No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
c00000 +++$+++ Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay. Thank you.
c00000 +++$+++ To see Dad?
c00000 +++$+++ Not an option.
c00000 +++$+++ You got to go back now!
c00000 +++$+++ And?
c00000 +++$+++ ... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
c00000 +++$+++ You're not pregnant, are you?
c00000 +++$+++ I'll drive.
c00000 +++$+++ Right -- let's talk about rent...
c00000 +++$+++ Area code 212-555-0199.
c00000 +++$+++ When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
c00000 +++$+++ You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
c00000 +++$+++ Like she knows about Hollis' death. Like she knows more than you want her to tell.
c00000 +++$+++ What about Jeb?
c00000 +++$+++ I'll be back after I make this delivery.
c00000 +++$+++ You're in league with Barbossa!
c00000 +++$+++ You've just done it -
c00000 +++$+++ How long have I been on Gateway station?
c00000 +++$+++ Like he would find Dignan. One day.
c00000 +++$+++ This interview's over! The militia stays!
c00000 +++$+++ No.  Wait for the police.
c00000 +++$+++ Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
c00000 +++$+++ Do we shake hands?
c00000 +++$+++ I am comfortable.
c00000 +++$+++ Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a sense of humor at all times.  Okay, the receptor rig... what I'm putting on your head... sends a signal to the recorder.  See we call it "being wired," but there's no wire.  You gotta keep the recorder close... five, six feet away max, like in your jacket pocket by the bed or wherever you're going to close escrow, know what I mean?
c00000 +++$+++ And you believe that?
c00000 +++$+++ Mr. Sparrow!  I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
c00000 +++$+++ What are you doing here?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
c00000 +++$+++ All I get are the Orientals. They can build 'em, but they can't drive 'em So? What are you doing here? What's with the outfit -- ?
c00000 +++$+++ Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
c00000 +++$+++ Whether crabs are in season there now...
c00000 +++$+++ Win?
c00000 +++$+++ How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
c00000 +++$+++ The fog is too heavy, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ Your roller coaster that is, quote: "unlike any that has ever come before it."
c00000 +++$+++ It was in his bag. Now it's not.
c00000 +++$+++ The Lord be with you.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ How is this legal?
c00000 +++$+++ It's not over yet.
c00000 +++$+++ You lost Ben?!
c00000 +++$+++ What's the difference?
c00000 +++$+++ You can trust me.
c00000 +++$+++ As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you want me to be there?
c00000 +++$+++ For getting rid of that cast.
c00000 +++$+++ I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
c00000 +++$+++ Which way did she go?
c00000 +++$+++ How'd the two of you hook up, then?
c00000 +++$+++ They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
c00000 +++$+++ No!
c00000 +++$+++ Is that your real name? Really?
c00000 +++$+++ Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
c00000 +++$+++ By the hour of nine.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ For twelve francs, seventy-five.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't want to drag you down with me.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
c00000 +++$+++ Possibly.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know, Mom; I've never met Bobby.
c00000 +++$+++ Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
c00000 +++$+++ It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
c00000 +++$+++ I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
c00000 +++$+++ What did Gino drink?
c00000 +++$+++ Can I have milk too?
c00000 +++$+++ If you did, you never showed it.
c00000 +++$+++ Me, too.
c00000 +++$+++ Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
c00000 +++$+++ But the white dot in the middle; that's got to mean something.
c00000 +++$+++ He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
c00000 +++$+++ She finds him "personable."
c00000 +++$+++ The ride is free.
c00000 +++$+++ I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
c00000 +++$+++ I always figured I'd live longer without it.
c00000 +++$+++ I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
c00000 +++$+++ It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
c00000 +++$+++ Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
c00000 +++$+++ What?!
c00000 +++$+++ I'm your family.
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
c00000 +++$+++ Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
c00000 +++$+++ I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
c00000 +++$+++ You're asking me why?
c00000 +++$+++ How'd you get in the building?
c00000 +++$+++ Can I go in?
c00000 +++$+++ This ought to be good.
c00000 +++$+++ You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
c00000 +++$+++ Want one?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
c00000 +++$+++ Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
c00000 +++$+++ Just the paper.
c00000 +++$+++ The dame's too smart for him.
c00000 +++$+++ The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
c00000 +++$+++ Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
c00000 +++$+++ Like what?
c00000 +++$+++ It is that.
c00000 +++$+++ If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
c00000 +++$+++ And, <u>with</u> disrespect, Constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.
c00000 +++$+++ Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
c00000 +++$+++ Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
c00000 +++$+++ Dreyfuss.
c00000 +++$+++ I thought you said you were ready.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
c00000 +++$+++ What can we do?
c00000 +++$+++ Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun. We'll just shoot him. Bang! Dead. Done.
c00000 +++$+++ How many?
c00000 +++$+++ Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
c00000 +++$+++ Where's my father?
c00000 +++$+++ He's your client, huh?
c00000 +++$+++ No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
c00000 +++$+++ I feel fine.
c00000 +++$+++ Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
c00000 +++$+++ You're always in the middle of a match.
c00000 +++$+++ How come?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
c00000 +++$+++ But you --
c00000 +++$+++ ...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
c00000 +++$+++ Why don't you come in, have a drink?
c00000 +++$+++ I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
c00000 +++$+++ Grounded for the rest of the year?
c00000 +++$+++ Not just that way. As a friend...
c00000 +++$+++ The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
c00000 +++$+++ They're worth less points.
c00000 +++$+++ So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
c00000 +++$+++ How do you know it's for us?
c00000 +++$+++ Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
c00000 +++$+++ It's bad business.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, God, no!
c00000 +++$+++ Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
c00000 +++$+++ Never?
c00000 +++$+++ Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know what else to do.
c00000 +++$+++ She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
c00000 +++$+++ He's smart, powerful, successful --
c00000 +++$+++ No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
c00000 +++$+++ It looks so soft.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure I'm alright.
c00000 +++$+++ Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
c00000 +++$+++ None.
c00000 +++$+++ Amnesia.
c00000 +++$+++ Enough of that crap.
c00000 +++$+++ I'd stay away from her, Miles.
c00000 +++$+++ But I could be anybody.
c00000 +++$+++ When he first came in to the sleep lab?
c00000 +++$+++ You got anybody, Wick?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
c00000 +++$+++ Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
c00000 +++$+++ ...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
c00000 +++$+++ But with compassion and insight--
c00000 +++$+++ I mean really never.
c00000 +++$+++ Right.
c00000 +++$+++ When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
c00000 +++$+++ Lisbon?
c00000 +++$+++ I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
c00000 +++$+++ I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
c00000 +++$+++ I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
c00000 +++$+++ And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
c00000 +++$+++ I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
c00000 +++$+++ Lots of shelters were in this bill.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, madame!
c00000 +++$+++ Going on... like...?
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ That's a very wise deduction, General.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
c00000 +++$+++ Six weeks and no sex?
c00000 +++$+++ With, like, images?
c00000 +++$+++ I think something's wrong, too, Miss. But not the same thing. I think your private detective is what's wrong.  I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from Norman Bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
c00000 +++$+++ I was just passin' the time.
c00000 +++$+++ What are you talking about?  Sugar and me, we're just like sisters.
c00000 +++$+++ Miss what?
c00000 +++$+++ Tracy.
c00000 +++$+++ Look, John--what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a--
c00000 +++$+++ So now you are free to love
c00000 +++$+++ I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
c00000 +++$+++ There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
c00000 +++$+++ Kill someone.  I can't do it.
c00000 +++$+++ A ride.  You want one?
c00000 +++$+++ But I made this arrangement --
c00000 +++$+++ You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
c00000 +++$+++ A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
c00000 +++$+++ I used it to start the fire --
c00000 +++$+++ The bishop is breathing down our necks.
c00000 +++$+++ Gimme ten bucks.
c00000 +++$+++ And who in God's name do you think you are....?
c00000 +++$+++ That's alright.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
c00000 +++$+++ ...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
c00000 +++$+++ The same day she supposedly went down.
c00000 +++$+++ Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
c00000 +++$+++ So you're saying it's not true.
c00000 +++$+++ Of course.
c00000 +++$+++ And... uh-
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
c00000 +++$+++ An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
c00000 +++$+++ Compass.
c00000 +++$+++ They don't?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know. How does that get Wigand on the air?
c00000 +++$+++ Ajaccio.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry about some of the people I had to see today.  It was bad timing... but it couldn't be helped.
c00000 +++$+++ Ya find the work interesting, do ya?
c00000 +++$+++ Where are you right now?
c00000 +++$+++ Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, do something, then, damnit!
c00000 +++$+++ Any I.D.?
c00000 +++$+++ You're fucking dead!
c00000 +++$+++ Like you're from N'Yawk.
c00000 +++$+++ Thirty-six-- sev-- aah I lost the count.
c00000 +++$+++ Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same problem.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, Tangerine.
c00000 +++$+++ The vow of obedience.
c00000 +++$+++ This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
c00000 +++$+++ But they must be! They cut glass!
c00000 +++$+++ Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
c00000 +++$+++ But it's yours. I won't let them ...
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah. Why, you know him?
c00000 +++$+++ She likes this dress...
c00000 +++$+++ I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll take it from here --  I am --
c00000 +++$+++ Who we working for?
c00000 +++$+++ Ben ... Ben ...
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
c00000 +++$+++ What do you think?
c00000 +++$+++ Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
c00000 +++$+++ It's colder in there.
c00000 +++$+++ So...?
c00000 +++$+++ You come stealee tleasoo?
c00000 +++$+++ You know what I'm gonna do.
c00000 +++$+++ Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
c00000 +++$+++ What do you want with those two medical officers?
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
c00000 +++$+++ I wrote that.
c00000 +++$+++ Will it?
c00000 +++$+++ Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
c00000 +++$+++ I forget mine for years on end.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh no. You'll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
c00000 +++$+++ Soon, Lord Vader.
c00000 +++$+++ It is day, of course, Freya.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
c00000 +++$+++ Are you going to kill her?
c00000 +++$+++ I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
c00000 +++$+++ What about down?
c00000 +++$+++ It's just more than anybody else does around here.
c00000 +++$+++ Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
c00000 +++$+++ No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
c00000 +++$+++ Mom--I'm not--
c00000 +++$+++ You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
c00000 +++$+++ Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
c00000 +++$+++ No, why?
c00000 +++$+++ Don't give me a hard time Walter! You don't want to get me mad!  You're coming with me!
c00000 +++$+++ The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
c00000 +++$+++ Dashboard.
c00000 +++$+++ In a dress.
c00000 +++$+++ It's anti-nature.
c00000 +++$+++ Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
c00000 +++$+++ Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
c00000 +++$+++ Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
c00000 +++$+++ What about it?
c00000 +++$+++ I was misquoted.
c00000 +++$+++ He does.
c00000 +++$+++ You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
c00000 +++$+++ You wanted an answer to your question.
c00000 +++$+++ You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
c00000 +++$+++ Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
c00000 +++$+++ Can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
c00000 +++$+++ And whose fault is that?  If we'd won in Vietnam ...
c00000 +++$+++ What were you doing in a library?
c00000 +++$+++ Older than me.
c00000 +++$+++ No... But...
c00000 +++$+++ Ecentus stultorum magister.
c00000 +++$+++ You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
c00000 +++$+++ That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
c00000 +++$+++ I know how to fight!
c00000 +++$+++ The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
c00000 +++$+++ You never eat when you're despondent.
c00000 +++$+++ Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
c00000 +++$+++ My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
c00000 +++$+++ You'll come by?
c00000 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c00000 +++$+++ Please, Dad, just do it.
c00000 +++$+++ I wouldn't do that...
c00000 +++$+++ No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
c00000 +++$+++ We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
c00000 +++$+++ So, where's "Weird Al"?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
c00000 +++$+++ ...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't want to hurt my daddy.
c00000 +++$+++ Six Martinis.
c00000 +++$+++ Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
c00000 +++$+++ Preoccupied with what?
c00000 +++$+++ Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
c00000 +++$+++ f 2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-
c00000 +++$+++ No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
c00000 +++$+++ It's just a symbol, honey -
c00000 +++$+++ How do you keep the water temperature stable?
c00000 +++$+++ And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
c00000 +++$+++ There's only seventy-eight.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh!
c00000 +++$+++ I understand your anxiety.
c00000 +++$+++ Backup?
c00000 +++$+++ Why, so you could humiliate me?
c00000 +++$+++ She said she's got to be home by nine.
c00000 +++$+++ He's a writer, not a madman.
c00000 +++$+++ Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
c00000 +++$+++ You haven't even seen it!
c00000 +++$+++ Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
c00000 +++$+++ It doesn't mean anything.
c00000 +++$+++ How come I never hearda you before?
c00000 +++$+++ No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  That's true.  But...
c00000 +++$+++ I had it on the island with me.
c00000 +++$+++ It's me.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
c00000 +++$+++ I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
c00000 +++$+++ Little boys. Looking up my skirt as I danced. Giggling.
c00000 +++$+++ I was in the middle of --
c00000 +++$+++ Sure.
c00000 +++$+++ Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
c00000 +++$+++ You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything?
c00000 +++$+++ When do you think it'll be done?
c00000 +++$+++ The birthday party.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt them, has he?
c00000 +++$+++ Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
c00000 +++$+++ Why selfish?
c00000 +++$+++ Little Red Riding Hood.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know where he is.
c00000 +++$+++ ...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
c00000 +++$+++ You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
c00000 +++$+++ I've seen you.  From the window.
c00000 +++$+++ And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
c00000 +++$+++ Third group. What's your assignment?
c00000 +++$+++ Do you want to stay?
c00000 +++$+++ Why does anyone want to be in movies?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.
c00000 +++$+++ You have ten seconds.
c00000 +++$+++ But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
c00000 +++$+++ I know what day it is!  Get off the phone.
c00000 +++$+++ Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
c00000 +++$+++ Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
c00000 +++$+++ Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
c00000 +++$+++ Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
c00000 +++$+++ Didn't you have any help?
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
c00000 +++$+++ Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, dear!
c00000 +++$+++ I don't want to do that,
c00000 +++$+++ What else?
c00000 +++$+++ Are you sure all her signatures are real?  It's not easy to get all those signatures.
c00000 +++$+++ No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
c00000 +++$+++ And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
c00000 +++$+++ Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
c00000 +++$+++ I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, thanks, that's great.
c00000 +++$+++ How?
c00000 +++$+++ I want to go home.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
c00000 +++$+++ Here.
c00000 +++$+++ I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
c00000 +++$+++ Goodbye.
c00000 +++$+++ Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
c00000 +++$+++ So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
c00000 +++$+++ Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
c00000 +++$+++ That's right.
c00000 +++$+++ If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
c00000 +++$+++ Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
c00000 +++$+++ That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ Me.
c00000 +++$+++ You're a cocksucker!
c00000 +++$+++ So you'll come to the wedding, right?
c00000 +++$+++ That depends.
c00000 +++$+++ I think it's badly scarred too. From a motorcycle accident.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay.
c00000 +++$+++ Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
c00000 +++$+++ She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
c00000 +++$+++ I wasn't hitting on your girl!
c00000 +++$+++ But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there.  Why not use that?
c00000 +++$+++ You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
c00000 +++$+++ May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
c00000 +++$+++ We might as well pack.
c00000 +++$+++ Why not?
c00000 +++$+++ "Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
c00000 +++$+++ See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
c00000 +++$+++ This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
c00000 +++$+++ Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
c00000 +++$+++ The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
c00000 +++$+++ By whom?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
c00000 +++$+++ Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
c00000 +++$+++ Your family ate dripping?
c00000 +++$+++ Tell me!
c00000 +++$+++ Harlin around?
c00000 +++$+++ Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
c00000 +++$+++ David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
c00000 +++$+++ I can't imagine any place better than here.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
c00000 +++$+++ Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ He is.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't trust anybody.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't to say it.  I can tell.
c00000 +++$+++ No, I didn't know that.
c00000 +++$+++ Have a drink.
c00000 +++$+++ I have to go.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
c00000 +++$+++ Yes. How did...
c00000 +++$+++ I suppose.
c00000 +++$+++ ....Hi.....
c00000 +++$+++ Come on.
c00000 +++$+++ The boss wants to see you.
c00000 +++$+++ If you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
c00000 +++$+++ That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
c00000 +++$+++ You're absolutely right.  Yes, you're right.  Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.  	We're over- dependent on automation, I can see that now.  But that's all correctable for the next time around.
c00000 +++$+++ Can I free the prisoners?
c00000 +++$+++ Sheila...
c00000 +++$+++ Dad...
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
c00000 +++$+++ I've lost my knack.
c00000 +++$+++ Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
c00000 +++$+++ They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!
c00000 +++$+++ What kind of stuff?
c00000 +++$+++ Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
c00000 +++$+++ You only hurt yourself you know?
c00000 +++$+++ This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
c00000 +++$+++ And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
c00000 +++$+++ Barry?  Barry knows about this?
c00000 +++$+++ You do?  What else you do?
c00000 +++$+++ But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
c00000 +++$+++ When does he graduate high school?
c00000 +++$+++ Cool. See you later.
c00000 +++$+++ You're right. Only you can do that.
c00000 +++$+++ Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
c00000 +++$+++ I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm a bowler.
c00000 +++$+++ It's right in front of us.
c00000 +++$+++ -- those are very serious allegations, Agent Scully --
c00000 +++$+++ Let's get naked.
c00000 +++$+++ The one on the other side is letting men in.
c00000 +++$+++ You're practically naked!
c00000 +++$+++ Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
c00000 +++$+++ It was fun while it lasted.
c00000 +++$+++ So?
c00000 +++$+++ You? You went by the book?
c00000 +++$+++ Fifteen thousand.
c00000 +++$+++ That makes two of us.
c00000 +++$+++ Eddie...
c00000 +++$+++ I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
c00000 +++$+++ Please.
c00000 +++$+++ Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
c00000 +++$+++ Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
c00000 +++$+++ Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
c00000 +++$+++ Let's get outta here.
c00000 +++$+++ Ui-vol-i-tub!
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
c00000 +++$+++ I think that either you're going to give them to him or he's going to make you give them to him.
c00000 +++$+++ We had some lemonade and he left.
c00000 +++$+++ . . . What?
c00000 +++$+++ Something like that. You?
c00000 +++$+++ Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
c00000 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c00000 +++$+++ Shut up!
c00000 +++$+++ I wouldn't dare answer that.
c00000 +++$+++ If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
c00000 +++$+++ We walked all night...
c00000 +++$+++ I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
c00000 +++$+++ Forgive me father.
c00000 +++$+++ You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
c00000 +++$+++ Knots!
c00000 +++$+++ Why not?
c00000 +++$+++ It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
c00000 +++$+++ Death may be the result....  Are you sure?
c00000 +++$+++ So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
c00000 +++$+++ Nobody!
c00000 +++$+++ You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
c00000 +++$+++ She jumped out of the window.
c00000 +++$+++ I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
c00000 +++$+++ He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
c00000 +++$+++ --because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
c00000 +++$+++ Where's Richard and Julia?
c00000 +++$+++ She wired this system.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes...
c00000 +++$+++ Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
c00000 +++$+++ And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, that would be wonderful!
c00000 +++$+++ Big threat. TV would ream you.
c00000 +++$+++ No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
c00000 +++$+++ Tell you ...
c00000 +++$+++ Well, you did invite me here.
c00000 +++$+++ Would you mind terribly?
c00000 +++$+++ I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
c00000 +++$+++ What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
c00000 +++$+++ I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
c00000 +++$+++ We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
c00000 +++$+++ ...Who is this?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you wanna tour the clubs?
c00000 +++$+++ Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
c00000 +++$+++ We have that taken care of.  You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this. No one, you hear?
c00000 +++$+++ Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
c00000 +++$+++ [Why?]
c00000 +++$+++ You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
c00000 +++$+++ If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
c00000 +++$+++ You're not a failure, Dick.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah -- old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
c00000 +++$+++ We can always do that, Duff.
c00000 +++$+++ He'd give me a job.
c00000 +++$+++ Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
c00000 +++$+++ I think you're quite handsome.
c00000 +++$+++ You want --
c00000 +++$+++ I'm no easier to live with than he was.
c00000 +++$+++ Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
c00000 +++$+++ What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
c00000 +++$+++ He wasn't even in the car?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
c00000 +++$+++ I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.
c00000 +++$+++ Tea... or whiskey?
c00000 +++$+++ Blocked.
c00000 +++$+++ No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
c00000 +++$+++ Got it.
c00000 +++$+++ Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
c00000 +++$+++ So what should I do with the pudding?
c00000 +++$+++ That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.  Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
c00000 +++$+++ We are in the Residence of the Fartsbishop of Salzburg.
c00000 +++$+++ PG& -- Are you sure?
c00000 +++$+++ You were great.
c00000 +++$+++ No.  It wasn't like that!
c00000 +++$+++ You want her to visit you?  Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
c00000 +++$+++ Are all Jews the same?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
c00000 +++$+++ What's he do?  Nibble your bum?
c00000 +++$+++ You takin' his side?
c00000 +++$+++ I always lock my files.  And you were the only one here today...  What do you mean, you son of a bitch?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
c00000 +++$+++ I know.  Thank her for me.
c00000 +++$+++ And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
c00000 +++$+++ No, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
c00000 +++$+++ The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ He wants to leave things on a good note.
c00000 +++$+++ Did you ever want to?
c00000 +++$+++ You must bring something heavy to the deal.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
c00000 +++$+++ No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
c00000 +++$+++ I like her.
c00000 +++$+++ Huh.
c00000 +++$+++ Naturally.
c00000 +++$+++ What is that?
c00000 +++$+++ I believe you, Austin. Let's go.
c00000 +++$+++ No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
c00000 +++$+++ You need to believe in something besides yourself.
c00000 +++$+++ Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
c00000 +++$+++ Bobby and Ricky.
c00000 +++$+++ Not at all, Hank ... not at all. Glad to help you.
c00000 +++$+++ I'd sure like to know who.
c00000 +++$+++ Who's "we"?
c00000 +++$+++ How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
c00000 +++$+++ And I'm talking about enjoying myself.
c00000 +++$+++ Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
c00000 +++$+++ Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
c00000 +++$+++ And you honestly think that's what she meant?
c00000 +++$+++ Where is the key?
c00000 +++$+++ 'Least they don't scare women.
c00000 +++$+++ No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
c00000 +++$+++ No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
c00000 +++$+++ Who?
c00000 +++$+++ I understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while I radio back to HQ -
c00000 +++$+++ That son of a bitch.
c00000 +++$+++ But, they don't speak English.
c00000 +++$+++ I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
c00000 +++$+++ Thanks for the vote of confidence.
c00000 +++$+++ Incredible.
c00000 +++$+++ Possibly some coffee?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
c00000 +++$+++ You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
c00000 +++$+++ Because Gaston was after it.
c00000 +++$+++ He can still watch.
c00000 +++$+++ Uh huh.
c00000 +++$+++ You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
c00000 +++$+++ Look, Mattie, I know you're-
c00000 +++$+++ No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
c00000 +++$+++ The rest is Barker's bank records. It's mostly the eighty-nine thousand in Mexican cashier's checks--
c00000 +++$+++ You're looking fine, Major.
c00000 +++$+++ A puppet.
c00000 +++$+++ I'd like to, that's all.  Girls your age don't do that.  You need an explanation?
c00000 +++$+++ I know.
c00000 +++$+++ Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
c00000 +++$+++ I got whiskey here.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
c00000 +++$+++ Where?  Show me where.
c00000 +++$+++ I can. Because I choose it.
c00000 +++$+++ That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
c00000 +++$+++ One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
c00000 +++$+++ I look familiar?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
c00000 +++$+++ It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ You a lesbo?
c00000 +++$+++ You damn right they didn't, especially Emory, my cousin.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm kind of busy.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure it's about you.  But it's about society, too.
c00000 +++$+++ Why do you do it?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, let's say
c00000 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't see anything.
c00000 +++$+++ Fruit.
c00000 +++$+++ That's a nice teapot.
c00000 +++$+++ The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
c00000 +++$+++ Are you for real?
c00000 +++$+++ What was wrong?
c00000 +++$+++ Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why?
c00000 +++$+++ One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
c00000 +++$+++ Of course.
c00000 +++$+++ Well--we're newlyweds.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you think he singled you out?
c00000 +++$+++ You don't see any blood?
c00000 +++$+++ Have another?
c00000 +++$+++ County water board.  All righty, thanks.
c00000 +++$+++ Other than, he's shagging your exgirlfriend?
c00000 +++$+++ If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
c00000 +++$+++ You're a..."guest" of the Master Control Program. They're going to make you play video games.
c00000 +++$+++ How was it contracted?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know why the floor was wet!
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
c00000 +++$+++ These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
c00000 +++$+++ Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
c00000 +++$+++ These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
c00000 +++$+++ C'mon.
c00000 +++$+++ Hector woudn't do anything.
c00000 +++$+++ ... Yes. You can take me.
c00000 +++$+++ No, I'm not...  I'm not.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh-kay...
c00000 +++$+++ It was so cool. He didn't say a word. He was just... ready, you know?  And we didn't kiss or talk or anything. He just sat there and let me do all the work.
c00000 +++$+++ Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
c00000 +++$+++ Died...
c00000 +++$+++ Because I have to.
c00000 +++$+++ Why not?
c00000 +++$+++ I think it should be outlawed.
c00000 +++$+++ Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
c00000 +++$+++ Why would you do this...?
c00000 +++$+++ No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't have to, now.
c00000 +++$+++ You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
c00000 +++$+++ That's all there is.
c00000 +++$+++ New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
c00000 +++$+++ My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
c00000 +++$+++ Thanks, Tatum.
c00000 +++$+++ There's nothing wrong with ... that.
c00000 +++$+++ And where are they going with it?
c00000 +++$+++ Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
c00000 +++$+++ That's the deal.
c00000 +++$+++ On accounta...
c00000 +++$+++ Sally Ann Cavanaugh. Oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
c00000 +++$+++ JOE What does some island have to do with this? It's a mistake?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm the man.
c00000 +++$+++ I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
c00000 +++$+++ You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
c00000 +++$+++ He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
c00000 +++$+++ A harmless joke.
c00000 +++$+++ You're just scared.
c00000 +++$+++ Is it me? Is it my fault?
c00000 +++$+++ Please!  Please!
c00000 +++$+++ You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
c00000 +++$+++ Three is not Farrow.
c00000 +++$+++ In here. With us.
c00000 +++$+++ Excuse me...
c00000 +++$+++ You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
c00000 +++$+++ So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
c00000 +++$+++ Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
c00000 +++$+++ The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
c00000 +++$+++ We're alone.
c00000 +++$+++ No! Well, yes, but
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, thanks.
c00000 +++$+++ What is it now?
c00000 +++$+++ You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
c00000 +++$+++ Will you excuse us please?
c00000 +++$+++ I thought you'd be happy to leave.
c00000 +++$+++ I like that... yeah!
c00000 +++$+++ I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--
c00000 +++$+++ Is that what you call it? "Real"?
c00000 +++$+++ Stop, we're embarrassing h...
c00000 +++$+++ From the guys who got the matches, of course.
c00000 +++$+++ I've noticed.
c00000 +++$+++ I've got a job.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you know him?
c00000 +++$+++ Pinkus.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, thank you for your help.
c00000 +++$+++ Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
c00000 +++$+++ Shh------ it's all right --- I'll be all right.
c00000 +++$+++ Where is it?
c00000 +++$+++ I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah. But not with the Cong.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, Mack?
c00000 +++$+++ We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
c00000 +++$+++ Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
c00000 +++$+++ But she's a member of The Twelve Families.  How can they hold her?
c00000 +++$+++ I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
c00000 +++$+++ Lecter said a lot of things.
c00000 +++$+++ And if I use them to kill you?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
c00000 +++$+++ You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
c00000 +++$+++ But I just wanted to say --
c00000 +++$+++ She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
c00000 +++$+++ No, not at all.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back
c00000 +++$+++ It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
c00000 +++$+++ And now?
c00000 +++$+++ He saw the girl in the car...
c00000 +++$+++ I'm already free...
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ So you can't tell me anything?
c00000 +++$+++ Who was the architect?
c00000 +++$+++ I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
c00000 +++$+++ And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
c00000 +++$+++ Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
c00000 +++$+++ Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
c00000 +++$+++ And wear a crown and everything.
c00000 +++$+++ Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
c00000 +++$+++ We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
c00000 +++$+++ Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
c00000 +++$+++ What about coffins?
c00000 +++$+++ That's right.
c00000 +++$+++ Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
c00000 +++$+++ He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes he is.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah?
c00000 +++$+++ It's much safer in there, sweety.
c00000 +++$+++ You were wonderful.
c00000 +++$+++ Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
c00000 +++$+++ It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay... Lemme clear it with...
c00000 +++$+++ Is that a fact?
c00000 +++$+++ Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay.
c00000 +++$+++ Dino...
c00000 +++$+++ [Beat] What?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.
c00000 +++$+++ I was just about to have my dinner.
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't think I wanted to.
c00000 +++$+++ What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
c00000 +++$+++ They're your fans, your audience-
c00000 +++$+++ You're a liar.
c00000 +++$+++ Can I come in for a minute?
c00000 +++$+++ When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
c00000 +++$+++ I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
c00000 +++$+++ What about Citrine?
c00000 +++$+++ And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
c00000 +++$+++ You like mysteries that much?
c00000 +++$+++ Lord, you're stubborn.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
c00000 +++$+++ Got her mother's looks.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know --
c00000 +++$+++ You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
c00000 +++$+++ Here you are.
c00000 +++$+++ ...that's a good motto.
c00000 +++$+++ Let's end this here.
c00000 +++$+++ I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
c00000 +++$+++ The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
c00000 +++$+++ Because...?
c00000 +++$+++ I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
c00000 +++$+++ There were many men interested in you?
c00000 +++$+++ They will have our description before we can get a plane.
c00000 +++$+++ I may have, as... as I said, I simply don't remember.
c00000 +++$+++ Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
c00000 +++$+++ Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
c00000 +++$+++ You're not going to ....
c00000 +++$+++ The heart, I guess.
c00000 +++$+++ Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
c00000 +++$+++ In high school.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes!  They'll be in soon.
c00000 +++$+++ I bet.  How much?
c00000 +++$+++ -- Will he keep his word?
c00000 +++$+++ What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
c00000 +++$+++ First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
c00000 +++$+++ I have detailed files.
c00000 +++$+++ Now? We just --
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ Art.
c00000 +++$+++ You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
c00000 +++$+++ I'd like to see you work.
c00000 +++$+++ All four?
c00000 +++$+++ How?
c00000 +++$+++ Well... Yeah - okay.
c00000 +++$+++ Save it for Bourne.
c00000 +++$+++ Well... I guess so.
c00000 +++$+++ Like what?
c00000 +++$+++ You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
c00000 +++$+++ When are you coming back?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, go on.
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ What the hell would you call this?
c00000 +++$+++ That's what the game's all about.
c00000 +++$+++ He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
c00000 +++$+++ IT IS CRAZY!
c00000 +++$+++ Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
c00000 +++$+++ Honey, go back to sleep, please!
c00000 +++$+++ No?
c00000 +++$+++ But I-- .
c00000 +++$+++ Well don't you think that's odd?
c00000 +++$+++ A meeting?
c00000 +++$+++ She is kicking you out.
c00000 +++$+++ It'll hold!
c00000 +++$+++ I was just thinking of... the noise.
c00000 +++$+++ Check.
c00000 +++$+++ Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, uh...Promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ Who ?
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ You remember that much?
c00000 +++$+++ You don't seem very sure.
c00000 +++$+++ Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
c00000 +++$+++ Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose.
c00000 +++$+++ Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm trying to get Susie to stand up to you.  But your manner is so threatening that she's afraid to speak!
c00000 +++$+++ Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
c00000 +++$+++ And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
c00000 +++$+++ We need to find a way to make me part of it.
c00000 +++$+++ But why would she -- ?
c00000 +++$+++ Mmmm...
c00000 +++$+++ You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
c00000 +++$+++ Look, I can be selfish, I know that.  I'm not blind to my own failings...
c00000 +++$+++ And all his works?
c00000 +++$+++ Go home, Walter.
c00000 +++$+++ *What* will be okay?
c00000 +++$+++ I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
c00000 +++$+++ Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.  I'm just not.
c00000 +++$+++ My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
c00000 +++$+++ I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
c00000 +++$+++ Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
c00000 +++$+++ Tsch.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
c00000 +++$+++ Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
c00000 +++$+++ What of it?
c00000 +++$+++ All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
c00000 +++$+++ Ann. Are you asking me hypothetically, or are you asking me for real, right now?
c00000 +++$+++ Alan Stanwyk.
c00000 +++$+++ OK. Bye.
c00000 +++$+++ No, no, no, not at all.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry, I --
c00000 +++$+++ Sweet Grace?  What about her?
c00000 +++$+++ You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
c00000 +++$+++ Or...
c00000 +++$+++ It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
c00000 +++$+++ Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
c00000 +++$+++ OK, so who was it, then?
c00000 +++$+++ The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
c00000 +++$+++ They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
c00000 +++$+++ What are they going to do?
c00000 +++$+++ I call myself Phoebe.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ The band has been playing over an hour.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not picking it up.
c00000 +++$+++ I know a guy in the Justice Department who was around the Grand Jury.
c00000 +++$+++ But I'm not prepared to die.
c00000 +++$+++ No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
c00000 +++$+++ All right...
c00000 +++$+++ There's so many I just can't keep track.
c00000 +++$+++ I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you want, Biff?
c00000 +++$+++ Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
c00000 +++$+++ No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
c00000 +++$+++ Holy shit! He said what I said!
c00000 +++$+++ Good luck.
c00000 +++$+++ How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
c00000 +++$+++ Where's she now?
c00000 +++$+++ What if it catches on fire?
c00000 +++$+++ Sire.
c00000 +++$+++ I should go to the house, get breakfast.
c00000 +++$+++ Shall I see you again?
c00000 +++$+++ The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
c00000 +++$+++ And this is not my first time on a private jet, so quit acting like I'm Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
c00000 +++$+++ But...
c00000 +++$+++ It's not like that, luv.
c00000 +++$+++ People have different emotional levels that --
c00000 +++$+++ You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
c00000 +++$+++ But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
c00000 +++$+++ What?!
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't do anything!
c00000 +++$+++ Collect?
c00000 +++$+++ To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
c00000 +++$+++ Whatever you say, darling.
c00000 +++$+++ No --
c00000 +++$+++ Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
c00000 +++$+++ How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
c00000 +++$+++ Shall I call the doctor?
c00000 +++$+++ ...you take that Anacott Steel?
c00000 +++$+++ How will it?
c00000 +++$+++ A surprise?
c00000 +++$+++ Them who?
c00000 +++$+++ Alright.
c00000 +++$+++ What was the response?
c00000 +++$+++ --had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
c00000 +++$+++ What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
c00000 +++$+++ Um-<u>hum</u> ...
c00000 +++$+++ Committing myself to what? You sure talk like a Policeman.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
c00000 +++$+++ Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
c00000 +++$+++ You've really got it all worked out, haven't you?
c00000 +++$+++ Can you build a house in four months?
c00000 +++$+++ I told you we don't know for certain.
c00000 +++$+++ What is the service, sir?
c00000 +++$+++ You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
c00000 +++$+++ Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat's nest.
c00000 +++$+++ I said you're soft.
c00000 +++$+++ I see.   A master criminal.
c00000 +++$+++ You flew up here because your boss--
c00000 +++$+++ You mean if I get sick?
c00000 +++$+++ Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.  What's that?
c00000 +++$+++ Mommy won't know.  You can do anything you want right now.  Mommy won't know.
c00000 +++$+++ Fucking grifters! I love it! You got balls, I'll give you that much.
c00000 +++$+++ There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you think I need a haircut?
c00000 +++$+++ I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
c00000 +++$+++ All right, so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught?
c00000 +++$+++ Yessss...
c00000 +++$+++ You're kidding me.
c00000 +++$+++ Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
c00000 +++$+++ Bobby--
c00000 +++$+++ Just one?
c00000 +++$+++ Have I said something amiss?
c00000 +++$+++ Do what? I haven't done a thing.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
c00000 +++$+++ It was blown up with the plane.
c00000 +++$+++ Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
c00000 +++$+++ Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
c00000 +++$+++ What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son--of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else.
c00000 +++$+++ The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
c00000 +++$+++ You can't know for sure, how can you?  I mean, you're not him.
c00000 +++$+++ You like kids.
c00000 +++$+++ Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
c00000 +++$+++ Ma didn't want it around.  After.
c00000 +++$+++ I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
c00000 +++$+++ Why her?
c00000 +++$+++ You don't know the real me.
c00000 +++$+++ Why not?
c00000 +++$+++ We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
c00000 +++$+++ Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
c00000 +++$+++ That's enough!
c00000 +++$+++ Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
c00000 +++$+++ I thought I'd wait for you.
c00000 +++$+++ Sorry.  I don't feel like sitting still today.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, there's got to be a way...
c00000 +++$+++ Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but --
c00000 +++$+++ You can't let anybody leave!
c00000 +++$+++ It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't believe you.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you know?
c00000 +++$+++ But, Lily--
c00000 +++$+++ Guess "please" would be a stretch.
c00000 +++$+++ Black.  No sugar.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
c00000 +++$+++ Boy, you must've been up early.
c00000 +++$+++ Hey, no kidding?  In color?
c00000 +++$+++ You mean, he was... let go, too?
c00000 +++$+++ And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
c00000 +++$+++ What did he want?
c00000 +++$+++ It looks like scurvy.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh shit...
c00000 +++$+++ Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
c00000 +++$+++ Hungry.
c00000 +++$+++ Anything.
c00000 +++$+++ Wendell, I want you to come to work for me.
c00000 +++$+++ No.  Richard talked to his parents.
c00000 +++$+++ Um... that's very relaxing.
c00000 +++$+++ What's going to happen?
c00000 +++$+++ What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
c00000 +++$+++ I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
c00000 +++$+++ I was trying to find the right time.
c00000 +++$+++ I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
c00000 +++$+++ Heard of Harry Lime?
c00000 +++$+++ Out front.
c00000 +++$+++ Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
c00000 +++$+++ I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
c00000 +++$+++ Fine...
c00000 +++$+++ I wanna hear it from you!
c00000 +++$+++ But I'm allergic to Retlax.
c00000 +++$+++ What are the odds?  Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
c00000 +++$+++ Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
c00000 +++$+++ Magic...
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
c00000 +++$+++ Industrial refuse.
c00000 +++$+++ How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
c00000 +++$+++ Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
c00000 +++$+++ Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied--
c00000 +++$+++ You work too hard, John.
c00000 +++$+++ Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
c00000 +++$+++ Good day, Marquis.
c00000 +++$+++ Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm on at nine.
c00000 +++$+++ Get out of my car!
c00000 +++$+++ Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
c00000 +++$+++ Sophie.
c00000 +++$+++ You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
c00000 +++$+++ Talk to me.
c00000 +++$+++ That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
c00000 +++$+++ The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
c00000 +++$+++ Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
c00000 +++$+++ Is she on the phone?
c00000 +++$+++ Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
c00000 +++$+++ Burt.
c00000 +++$+++ No, that should be more than --
c00000 +++$+++ Can I forget it?
c00000 +++$+++ What do you think?
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know. These things take time.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm going to change the world with or without you as a witness, Charles.  And this one gets a front row seat.
c00000 +++$+++ Calm down, what, what is it?
c00000 +++$+++ I want to talk to him.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not even listening.
c00000 +++$+++ Why does everyone wanna see my schlong?  I am the one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
c00000 +++$+++ Excuse me?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm making you feel like meat?
c00000 +++$+++ Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
c00000 +++$+++ I see.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
c00000 +++$+++ I knew him. He would never -
c00000 +++$+++ Did he explain how this happened?
c00000 +++$+++ It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
c00000 +++$+++ You're not seeing me?
c00000 +++$+++ I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
c00000 +++$+++ You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
c00000 +++$+++ You have to say that. You're my student.
c00000 +++$+++ We need padded chairs.
c00000 +++$+++ Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
c00000 +++$+++ Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
c00000 +++$+++ You're the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
c00000 +++$+++ Right across the bay there.
c00000 +++$+++ Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
c00000 +++$+++ Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
c00000 +++$+++ Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not going to quit now....
c00000 +++$+++ I told you the questions might get a little personal --
c00000 +++$+++ They're happy like this.
c00000 +++$+++ Never heard of him.
c00000 +++$+++ That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
c00000 +++$+++ Poison?  I'm surprised at you.  You lack vision, Mr. O'Brien.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
c00000 +++$+++ The hell you talking about? What train?
c00000 +++$+++ Now you thought of that, not me.
c00000 +++$+++ People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
c00000 +++$+++ Melanie...
c00000 +++$+++ Rats?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't expect you'd understand.
c00000 +++$+++ Were you pleased with his work?
c00000 +++$+++ It's possible.
c00000 +++$+++ It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
c00000 +++$+++ Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
c00000 +++$+++ Are--are you crying, Penelope?
c00000 +++$+++ Really. How'd it go?
c00000 +++$+++ It's a simple question.
c00000 +++$+++ You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
c00000 +++$+++ My husband is a very courageous man.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't think weapons are important?
c00000 +++$+++ Mikey was looking for you.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you mean?  What happened!
c00000 +++$+++ Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
c00000 +++$+++ With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
c00000 +++$+++ My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
c00000 +++$+++ I'd like to go now, Rand.  Would you mind taking me home?
c00000 +++$+++ Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
c00000 +++$+++ Fuck him.
c00000 +++$+++ I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh?
c00000 +++$+++ How about a ginger ale?
c00000 +++$+++ Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
c00000 +++$+++ On his day off. Get the exact address.
c00000 +++$+++ We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not going to jump on you!
c00000 +++$+++ Sam's piano.
c00000 +++$+++ ...miles.
c00000 +++$+++ Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
c00000 +++$+++ So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
c00000 +++$+++ She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
c00000 +++$+++ I have a little.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
c00000 +++$+++ You rat.
c00000 +++$+++ Be my guest. What you got?
c00000 +++$+++ I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't have squat.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
c00000 +++$+++ He's a freelance subversive?
c00000 +++$+++ You saved my life.
c00000 +++$+++ Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
c00000 +++$+++ But Countess...
c00000 +++$+++ Well, good luck with the job.
c00000 +++$+++ What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
c00000 +++$+++ Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
c00000 +++$+++ Nobody else is going to know it was us.
c00000 +++$+++ For what purpose?
c00000 +++$+++ She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not even a field person.
c00000 +++$+++ He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
c00000 +++$+++ Mickey, you're wasting time!
c00000 +++$+++ Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
c00000 +++$+++ Jack, I got no gloves.
c00000 +++$+++ Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
c00000 +++$+++ Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm on my way to get a haircut.
c00000 +++$+++ You didn't become crazy.
c00000 +++$+++ You got it.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't have any.
c00000 +++$+++ 'Course he does.
c00000 +++$+++ Bullshit. Walter!
c00000 +++$+++ The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
c00000 +++$+++ No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not climbing that.
c00000 +++$+++ I just mean...
c00000 +++$+++ California?
c00000 +++$+++ Come on. You're fucking hungover.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you think Mom would say?
c00000 +++$+++ Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
c00000 +++$+++ You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
c00000 +++$+++ Eddie, you screwed up.
c00000 +++$+++ Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
c00000 +++$+++ It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
c00000 +++$+++ She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta be ready. You know what I'm talkin' about?
c00000 +++$+++ Seattle.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.  Where you headed?
c00000 +++$+++ -- the sadistic prick --
c00000 +++$+++ Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
c00000 +++$+++ Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
c00000 +++$+++ YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
c00000 +++$+++ Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
c00000 +++$+++ Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
c00000 +++$+++ Thanks for stepping in.
c00000 +++$+++ Hiding what?
c00000 +++$+++ That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
c00000 +++$+++ Colonel will do.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you love about it?
c00000 +++$+++ Perhaps if you could explain a little--
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, Al ... This is just...
c00000 +++$+++ Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
c00000 +++$+++ Who's playing?
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe go back to school.
c00000 +++$+++ Your superiors are two days away!
c00000 +++$+++ Where are my cigarettes?
c00000 +++$+++ Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
c00000 +++$+++ And you're sure about this?
c00000 +++$+++ That doesn't matter.
c00000 +++$+++ Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe...
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ Me? Now? With Superman dead and you on my team? It's like I'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. What could I have to fear?
c00000 +++$+++ Stop it, Dil --
c00000 +++$+++ In the brain, I tell you. I know.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
c00000 +++$+++ But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
c00000 +++$+++ WHAT HAPPENED?
c00000 +++$+++ You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
c00000 +++$+++ I hate that music.
c00000 +++$+++ I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
c00000 +++$+++ But why? Why here?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
c00000 +++$+++ - - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you.
c00000 +++$+++ Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
c00000 +++$+++ The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
c00000 +++$+++ I have no defense against forged papers and--
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I'm here now. I'd like to do something...
c00000 +++$+++ He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
c00000 +++$+++ Paden sends his best.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
c00000 +++$+++ Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
c00000 +++$+++ They saved your ass, convict.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't you trust your own eyes.
c00000 +++$+++ I had to change. Did anyone call?
c00000 +++$+++ Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
c00000 +++$+++ No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
c00000 +++$+++ How?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, hell, you got the whole Chicago south side.  How do ya expect the eight lousy spots I've got to compete with that?
c00000 +++$+++ We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
c00000 +++$+++ It can't wait until tomorrow...
c00000 +++$+++ You're the killed.
c00000 +++$+++ We could use a little help.
c00000 +++$+++ *Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
c00000 +++$+++ Coupla days ago they dug up a body in Washington Heights - Mary Finelli.  Girl disappeared in '68.  Turns out she was his first kill.  Which means he probably knew her.  Most serials know their first victim.  I'm gonna do some checking - see if I can put any of this together...
c00000 +++$+++ Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
c00000 +++$+++ I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
c00000 +++$+++ But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
c00000 +++$+++ You could have asked for a favor.
c00000 +++$+++ If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
c00000 +++$+++ The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
c00000 +++$+++ He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
c00000 +++$+++ Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
c00000 +++$+++ Where's the magnet?
c00000 +++$+++ It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
c00000 +++$+++ That's what I thought. So remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
c00000 +++$+++ It wasn't intentional.
c00000 +++$+++ Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, so this is a tall tale?
c00000 +++$+++ Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
c00000 +++$+++ No, no. I don't want to be idle.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
c00000 +++$+++ You sure you're OK Teddy? You're not bowling are you?
c00000 +++$+++ Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't shoot.
c00000 +++$+++ ... Nothing.
c00000 +++$+++ This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
c00000 +++$+++ You're forgiven. Bye now.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't tell me-- don't tell me!
c00000 +++$+++ Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
c00000 +++$+++ Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
c00000 +++$+++ No, tell me.
c00000 +++$+++ It's a long story.
c00000 +++$+++ Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
c00000 +++$+++ I would like to ask you something.
c00000 +++$+++ You fucking build it!  Men come...
c00000 +++$+++ H-how'd you know?!
c00000 +++$+++ El/ella -
c00000 +++$+++ They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
c00000 +++$+++ You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
c00000 +++$+++ I said when I think about you, I get wet.
c00000 +++$+++ I think it's the food of the future.
c00000 +++$+++ No Jean, no money!
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
c00000 +++$+++ Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
c00000 +++$+++ You know why.  You saw it the other night at the piano.  You turned away from me.
c00000 +++$+++ Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
c00000 +++$+++ The, uh, blur there.
c00000 +++$+++ So could you get us into the principal's office?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, I'll kill you when you change, I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
c00000 +++$+++ My mother said he never asked about--
c00000 +++$+++ MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
c00000 +++$+++ Didn't I give you two?
c00000 +++$+++ This sucks.
c00000 +++$+++ Ray?... What time is it?
c00000 +++$+++ Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
c00000 +++$+++ We're makin' moves on each other.
c00000 +++$+++ Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
c00000 +++$+++ Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
c00000 +++$+++ I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
c00000 +++$+++ How were you paid?
c00000 +++$+++ So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ Marty...
c00000 +++$+++ It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
c00000 +++$+++ You're drunk --
c00000 +++$+++ Popup, on floorboards. And--
c00000 +++$+++ Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe myself.
c00000 +++$+++ Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
c00000 +++$+++ This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find OEem.
c00000 +++$+++ I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
c00000 +++$+++ She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
c00000 +++$+++ My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, nobody asked yuh.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
c00000 +++$+++ Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
c00000 +++$+++ And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
c00000 +++$+++ ...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
c00000 +++$+++ And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
c00000 +++$+++ She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
c00000 +++$+++ In a second.
c00000 +++$+++ It was on your shirt!
c00000 +++$+++ Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
c00000 +++$+++ I just got in.
c00000 +++$+++ It's Lynn.
c00000 +++$+++ Urgh.
c00000 +++$+++ Leave me alone!
c00000 +++$+++ Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
c00000 +++$+++ Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
c00000 +++$+++ Gotta go.
c00000 +++$+++ You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
c00000 +++$+++ Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
c00000 +++$+++ How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
c00000 +++$+++ The Miracle Kid.
c00000 +++$+++ What, want a glass?
c00000 +++$+++ Twenty years, Ma ...
c00000 +++$+++ None?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic thing. No big deal.
c00000 +++$+++ Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
c00000 +++$+++ No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
c00000 +++$+++ How'd you know my daddy?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers?
c00000 +++$+++ Everyone back.
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
c00000 +++$+++ If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not hungry.
c00000 +++$+++ What do I do?
c00000 +++$+++ Harold!
c00000 +++$+++ Nothing.  What were you going to say?
c00000 +++$+++ Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
c00000 +++$+++ You're acting like a child.
c00000 +++$+++ Look. I BEEN fightin', mister. I been fightin' for what feels like a hundred years and I'm finished. I don't need religion. I don't need prayers. I need a couple guns and a couple hands. We can sail on outa here. Find another island where there ain't so much....traffic.
c00000 +++$+++ They're dying.
c00000 +++$+++ No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
c00000 +++$+++ You think so?...Selina?
c00000 +++$+++ What the fuck... are you serious?
c00000 +++$+++ It didn't go off.
c00000 +++$+++ The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
c00000 +++$+++ What is it?
c00000 +++$+++ I'll be right back.
c00000 +++$+++ Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
c00000 +++$+++ What about your husband?
c00000 +++$+++ Get out.
c00000 +++$+++ Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
c00000 +++$+++ Let me out. I have to talk to you.
c00000 +++$+++ I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
c00000 +++$+++ Of what?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah I get bored.
c00000 +++$+++ Glenn, take the exit.
c00000 +++$+++ Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
c00000 +++$+++ But you don't want to hear it.
c00000 +++$+++ Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
c00000 +++$+++ -- bullshit --
c00000 +++$+++ This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor.  James Bond.
c00000 +++$+++ You know I can't.
c00000 +++$+++ Jonah, I'm leaving --
c00000 +++$+++ She back in Kansas?
c00000 +++$+++ I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
c00000 +++$+++ That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
c00000 +++$+++ You're saying you willed these events to happen?
c00000 +++$+++ Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
c00000 +++$+++ It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
c00000 +++$+++ I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
c00000 +++$+++ I know that.
c00000 +++$+++ I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
c00000 +++$+++ Of course. Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
c00000 +++$+++ It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
c00000 +++$+++ I guess I owe you my life.
c00000 +++$+++ He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
c00000 +++$+++ It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
c00000 +++$+++ Sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
c00000 +++$+++ Is there something wrong with that?
c00000 +++$+++ Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
c00000 +++$+++ I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
c00000 +++$+++ Not eating like you used to, that's what.
c00000 +++$+++ Heaven knows. A lot.
c00000 +++$+++ I will relay the particulars of our conversation to Mr. Maranzano.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes. In that order.
c00000 +++$+++ That kind of talk is between us. Don't you go in there with that shit on your tongue.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
c00000 +++$+++ No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
c00000 +++$+++ YOU HAVE TO!
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
c00000 +++$+++ Hold it down, okay?
c00000 +++$+++ But what about me?
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't kill him --
c00000 +++$+++ And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
c00000 +++$+++ But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
c00000 +++$+++ Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
c00000 +++$+++ Mm-hm.
c00000 +++$+++ Could be.
c00000 +++$+++ He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't.  He did it himself.
c00000 +++$+++ Find out what?
c00000 +++$+++ I hope I helped you out.
c00000 +++$+++ I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
c00000 +++$+++ Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
c00000 +++$+++ I know I can capture it.
c00000 +++$+++ No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
c00000 +++$+++ A girl?  Anyone I should know?
c00000 +++$+++ Castor's escaped!
c00000 +++$+++ What is it?
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ The Manzetti thing must have scared her. She thinks she'll get implicated.
c00000 +++$+++ It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
c00000 +++$+++ Morning.  Sometime.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
c00000 +++$+++ And you were gonna pay me back?
c00000 +++$+++ All they got is advertisements. Just like L.A.
c00000 +++$+++ Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
c00000 +++$+++ Oh..
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
c00000 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c00000 +++$+++ Listen to what I say --
c00000 +++$+++ I like it well done.
c00000 +++$+++ We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
c00000 +++$+++ ... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
c00000 +++$+++ I think you're full of shit.
c00000 +++$+++ That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
c00000 +++$+++ Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
c00000 +++$+++ I've had time to get over it. She was killed by wolves they think.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not.
c00000 +++$+++ Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
c00000 +++$+++ Louder please.
c00000 +++$+++ It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
c00000 +++$+++ You see someone?
c00000 +++$+++ Are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
c00000 +++$+++ The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
c00000 +++$+++ So simple to say, so hard to do.
c00000 +++$+++ Where'd they get you?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay.
c00000 +++$+++ Romeo and Juliet--just a suggestion.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Nobody's looking.
c00000 +++$+++ -In nomine sanctus esperitu-
c00000 +++$+++ I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
c00000 +++$+++ Huh?
c00000 +++$+++ This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
c00000 +++$+++ LET THY SPIRIT
c00000 +++$+++ Those were perfectly good fries, Hamilton.  Perfectly good.
c00000 +++$+++ You got that right.
c00000 +++$+++ What you do?
c00000 +++$+++ What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
c00000 +++$+++ ...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
c00000 +++$+++ String that Bluebeard up to a pole!
c00000 +++$+++ You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
c00000 +++$+++ Did you hear that?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh?
c00000 +++$+++ This your place?
c00000 +++$+++ You've had a lot of fun with me today.  What would you have done if I hadn't responded to your call?
c00000 +++$+++ You can't do this to me!
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, I like that very much.
c00000 +++$+++ But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
c00000 +++$+++ Lili... I love you!
c00000 +++$+++ You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
c00000 +++$+++ I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
c00000 +++$+++ Are you absolutely certain?
c00000 +++$+++ How?
c00000 +++$+++ Ale. I don't mind.
c00000 +++$+++ That doesn't mean I don't like hearing it.
c00000 +++$+++ And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
c00000 +++$+++ Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
c00000 +++$+++ And Outpost? You're happy there?
c00000 +++$+++ You're sure about this two person thing?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I would like to sit in front today.
c00000 +++$+++ I asked you a question. Do you love her?
c00000 +++$+++ I know the answer.  I know all there is to know about Louis.
c00000 +++$+++ Good luck to you too, Paul.
c00000 +++$+++ Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
c00000 +++$+++ Am I wrong!
c00000 +++$+++ And harems ... ?
c00000 +++$+++ Half a million.
c00000 +++$+++ You've made your point.
c00000 +++$+++ Train. It took eight hours.
c00000 +++$+++ She'll be all right.
c00000 +++$+++ Didn't you see her this morning?
c00000 +++$+++ You want 'em all arrested?
c00000 +++$+++ Go you Huskies?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  That will be company for you.
c00000 +++$+++ You're acting like a school girl.
c00000 +++$+++ Sounds smashing.  I'm in.  Muchacho, mi carro, por favor!  Now be serious.  You couldn't possibly want me off tonight's performance..
c00000 +++$+++ This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
c00000 +++$+++ Go away.
c00000 +++$+++ Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
c00000 +++$+++ No, thanks Dad.
c00000 +++$+++ No, he just hung out there.
c00000 +++$+++ Pistols?
c00000 +++$+++ Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
c00000 +++$+++ Uh, why, why are you doing this?
c00000 +++$+++ Don't give me your black magic bullshit! Seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny American boy? Do you have a motive?  Do you have a weapon? Or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
c00000 +++$+++ But you are taking it?
c00000 +++$+++ Found?  Where?
c00000 +++$+++ I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
c00000 +++$+++ You know what I want.
c00000 +++$+++ I hope you find him.
c00000 +++$+++ We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
c00000 +++$+++ Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
c00000 +++$+++ How do we decode it?
c00000 +++$+++ Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
c00000 +++$+++ Don't threaten me, Private.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you follow or should I speak slower?
c00000 +++$+++ Are you nervous, Walter?
c00000 +++$+++ Tell us about it...
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah -- yeah -- hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
c00000 +++$+++ The Office of Naval Intelligence.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you do for fun?
c00000 +++$+++ I just want to go back to my room.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ The soul.  The spirit.  Whatever you want to call it.
c00000 +++$+++ No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't want them here overnight.
c00000 +++$+++ I just don't want to.
c00000 +++$+++ Are you pretending yet?
c00000 +++$+++ You scored with two chicks?!
c00000 +++$+++ You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
c00000 +++$+++ You lost your head.
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
c00000 +++$+++ Look who I've found!
c00000 +++$+++ Come on.  Let's get a drink.
c00000 +++$+++ Evone tells me:  I shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
c00000 +++$+++ The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
c00000 +++$+++ Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
c00000 +++$+++ Eight-fifty.
c00000 +++$+++ Very well. Exercise caution, Lieutenant. This landing is Captain's discretion and I'm the one who's out on a limb.
c00000 +++$+++ Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
c00000 +++$+++ You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
c00000 +++$+++ What's wrong with my life?
c00000 +++$+++ You're possessive.
c00000 +++$+++ How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
c00000 +++$+++ There isn't any.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.
c00000 +++$+++ Where?
c00000 +++$+++ What's the first commandment?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.
c00000 +++$+++ I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
c00000 +++$+++ Give me his home number.
c00000 +++$+++ And the jacket?
c00000 +++$+++ The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
c00000 +++$+++ Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
c00000 +++$+++ There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
c00000 +++$+++ So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
c00000 +++$+++ Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
c00000 +++$+++ Shelly...!
c00000 +++$+++ It seemed like a good idea at the time.
c00000 +++$+++ Now how far would further out be?
c00000 +++$+++ All right. Put it in the room where we were.
c00000 +++$+++ I say, good morning, Lovey.
c00000 +++$+++ Fine, and how are you?
c00000 +++$+++ Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
c00000 +++$+++ We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, sure.
c00000 +++$+++ This has nothing to do with your fire.
c00000 +++$+++ It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
c00000 +++$+++ How should I know?
c00000 +++$+++ Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
c00000 +++$+++ He taught all this to Swann?
c00000 +++$+++ Who said I was depressed?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh yeah?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm a professional killer.
c00000 +++$+++ I was gonna do something with Joan.
c00000 +++$+++ Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
c00000 +++$+++ Suppress it.
c00000 +++$+++ That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
c00000 +++$+++ You hope what feels good?
c00000 +++$+++ I do alright.
c00000 +++$+++ Just that I was in the Marines.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't.
c00000 +++$+++ Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
c00000 +++$+++ The woman passenger on the boat that blew up.
c00000 +++$+++ Is this a joke?
c00000 +++$+++ I think the worst is over.
c00000 +++$+++ You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
c00000 +++$+++ Better today than tomorrow.
c00000 +++$+++ Just take it in stride.
c00000 +++$+++ Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
c00000 +++$+++ Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
c00000 +++$+++ Look under the body.
c00000 +++$+++ He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
c00000 +++$+++ When're you going to see him again?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't wanna write about no spic.
c00000 +++$+++ Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
c00000 +++$+++ You said it.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh.  So what is the scene about?
c00000 +++$+++ Take it. damn it!
c00000 +++$+++ But, Chris...
c00000 +++$+++ I am always receptive to suggestions.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
c00000 +++$+++ See? You do know something about him.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
c00000 +++$+++ But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
c00000 +++$+++ Come on, what was it?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm drunk.
c00000 +++$+++ George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
c00000 +++$+++ Something was just missing.
c00000 +++$+++ Where?
c00000 +++$+++ Roy?
c00000 +++$+++ There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
c00000 +++$+++ We've heard lots about you.
c00000 +++$+++ What for?
c00000 +++$+++ How'd you happen to come here?
c00000 +++$+++ He said he took it to a motel in Oklahoma City.  He also says that at that time he met a man.  He identified you through a series of mug shots.  He also told us that you and Mrs. Dickinson seemed "close." Is that true?
c00000 +++$+++ Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
c00000 +++$+++ Had enough ... ?
c00000 +++$+++ You went out with her?
c00000 +++$+++ What about Venice? Can we stick to that plan at least?
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ Are you sure?
c00000 +++$+++ In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
c00000 +++$+++ But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
c00000 +++$+++ All except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. But it hasn't yet been tested.
c00000 +++$+++ I wouldn't consider anyone else.
c00000 +++$+++ A lie?
c00000 +++$+++ Great.  Give me a grant.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe.
c00000 +++$+++ You're the one who got away.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
c00000 +++$+++ Take grain away from the army?
c00000 +++$+++ Sandra Sinclair.  Wanna know her real name?  Bella Iskowitz.  No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else.  Even you. Even me.  Especially me.  I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
c00000 +++$+++ Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
c00000 +++$+++ But at the playhouse. Nurse?
c00000 +++$+++ I work for the government.
c00000 +++$+++ Actually... I just want to go home.
c00000 +++$+++ Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
c00000 +++$+++ A year?  How'd you manage that?
c00000 +++$+++ Uh-huh?
c00000 +++$+++ Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
c00000 +++$+++ No. It's because you don't know how they died.
c00000 +++$+++ She was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  And...
c00000 +++$+++ Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
c00000 +++$+++ Pa! Shh!
c00000 +++$+++ Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you really think so?
c00000 +++$+++ Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
c00000 +++$+++ Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
c00000 +++$+++ Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
c00000 +++$+++ Sam--
c00000 +++$+++ When you do, let me in on it.
c00000 +++$+++ Let's hear it.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll help you tote 'em if I don't give out first.
c00000 +++$+++ I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.
c00000 +++$+++ Forty yards.  Less, maybe.  I assume it'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down.
c00000 +++$+++ No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
c00000 +++$+++ Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
c00000 +++$+++ Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
c00000 +++$+++ You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
c00000 +++$+++ So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
c00000 +++$+++ Two days?
c00000 +++$+++ But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
c00000 +++$+++ I'll need to make a phone call.
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you.  You still think that he was....
c00000 +++$+++ We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
c00000 +++$+++ I usually don't either.
c00000 +++$+++ You do?
c00000 +++$+++ Uh ... nah.
c00000 +++$+++ That's what I have to believe...
c00000 +++$+++ Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
c00000 +++$+++ Where... can I stay?
c00000 +++$+++ That's never been proven
c00000 +++$+++ No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
c00000 +++$+++ No. Not very big.
c00000 +++$+++ So what else is new?  Look Eva, you're asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for Tamara Mason. Wise up -- it's not hip to be her friend.
c00000 +++$+++ You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
c00000 +++$+++ We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ No, don't let her!  I'll... How about Peg? Robbie?
c00000 +++$+++ Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
c00000 +++$+++ You're too goddamned paranoid.
c00000 +++$+++ Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
c00000 +++$+++ Next week?
c00000 +++$+++ You buy me many things.  Thank you.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh... What are you working on?
c00000 +++$+++ Of course I have.
c00000 +++$+++ I guess I am.
c00000 +++$+++ Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
c00000 +++$+++ I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
c00000 +++$+++ I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
c00000 +++$+++ You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
c00000 +++$+++ A boost. A big boost ...
c00000 +++$+++ It's not really--
c00000 +++$+++ A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
c00000 +++$+++ I've left my <u>program</u>...
c00000 +++$+++ Keep your voice down.
c00000 +++$+++ This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
c00000 +++$+++ Where are all your queer party friends?
c00000 +++$+++ You sure you want me to?
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
c00000 +++$+++ Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, you can.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I just thought I'd call.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
c00000 +++$+++ Damn... alright then.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
c00000 +++$+++ But Richard, no, I, I --
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
c00000 +++$+++ I would.  But my suit --
c00000 +++$+++ Assumed name... Houston.
c00000 +++$+++ I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
c00000 +++$+++ He told me what to do.
c00000 +++$+++ I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
c00000 +++$+++ But Keaton...
c00000 +++$+++ Wha. . . Donny--
c00000 +++$+++ I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
c00000 +++$+++ Insurance?
c00000 +++$+++ Or else what?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
c00000 +++$+++ Push 'em back.
c00000 +++$+++ Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
c00000 +++$+++ Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
c00000 +++$+++ Well, what does it matter to you?
c00000 +++$+++ Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
c00000 +++$+++ And how many room got TV, Dusty?
c00000 +++$+++ The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
c00000 +++$+++ I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm gonna go now.
c00000 +++$+++ Snoopy?  I love Snoopy.
c00000 +++$+++ What can I do?
c00000 +++$+++ Watch me.
c00000 +++$+++ You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
c00000 +++$+++ Are you an artist?
c00000 +++$+++ Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
c00000 +++$+++ On what you pay me?
c00000 +++$+++ Can't you get the money from your friends?
c00000 +++$+++ D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry, that's all there is.
c00000 +++$+++ Ha Ha.
c00000 +++$+++ Ah, quit griping.  Keeps you in shape doesn't it?
c00000 +++$+++ That object out there is less than two days from Earth, Mister Scott. We've got to intercept while it still is out there!
c00000 +++$+++ Yes?
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ You work too hard, Pop.
c00000 +++$+++ No!
c00000 +++$+++ You wish.
c00000 +++$+++ Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
c00000 +++$+++ Be reasonable, Jack.
c00000 +++$+++ Strange!
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
c00000 +++$+++ And here. Here.
c00000 +++$+++ Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
c00000 +++$+++ Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
c00000 +++$+++ But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
c00000 +++$+++ Hey - the world is my office.
c00000 +++$+++ Want to take a poke at him?
c00000 +++$+++ Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
c00000 +++$+++ Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
c00000 +++$+++ Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
c00000 +++$+++ Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you better, I'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, I think so...
c00000 +++$+++ Sorry.
c00000 +++$+++ You know I can't.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ And sexy.
c00000 +++$+++ Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
c00000 +++$+++ What if--
c00000 +++$+++ You've got to be kidding.
c00000 +++$+++ That's not enough.  Tell me.
c00000 +++$+++ Not directly anyhow ...
c00000 +++$+++ I can't hear a word you're saying!
c00000 +++$+++ Golly, Ma --  Consarn that music! Shouldn't a-had the harvest festival tonight.
c00000 +++$+++ I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
c00000 +++$+++ You never thought that's a heavy load?
c00000 +++$+++ What's tomorrow?
c00000 +++$+++ Which one was that?
c00000 +++$+++ I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
c00000 +++$+++ That's not true -- Where are you--?
c00000 +++$+++ Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
c00000 +++$+++ They said go see the chaplain.
c00000 +++$+++ What girl?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm allergic to onions.
c00000 +++$+++ We really think he should be king and wear a crown and everything.
c00000 +++$+++ Qualify for what?
c00000 +++$+++ No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
c00000 +++$+++ What, vou?
c00000 +++$+++ So where have you been staying?
c00000 +++$+++ Where did you here that?
c00000 +++$+++ It's not true.
c00000 +++$+++ So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
c00000 +++$+++ I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm afraid so. There were rumors ----people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
c00000 +++$+++ Recite the Lord's Prayer.
c00000 +++$+++ There's no one here.
c00000 +++$+++ I love you, Elaine.
c00000 +++$+++ 'My father's house has many mansions.'
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know -- the gym, the fights. I <i>know</i> he don't miss the fights.  Having some tomorrow night at the State Theater.  He use to take me.
c00000 +++$+++ I got a lot more to learn, though. I really wasn't into art when I was a kid.
c00000 +++$+++ ...including the permanently extreme.
c00000 +++$+++ Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
c00000 +++$+++ You think you've found your calling?
c00000 +++$+++ No you don't.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
c00000 +++$+++ <u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
c00000 +++$+++ Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
c00000 +++$+++ I've never been anywhere.  I wouldn't know where to go.  Where would you go?
c00000 +++$+++ Where is he???
c00000 +++$+++ Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
c00000 +++$+++ Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
c00000 +++$+++ How can you help us?
c00000 +++$+++ What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
c00000 +++$+++ But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
c00000 +++$+++ Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
c00000 +++$+++ Is there anything I can do; anything I can send?
c00000 +++$+++ Yah, that's a good one.
c00000 +++$+++ Casualties?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
c00000 +++$+++ A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
c00000 +++$+++ You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
c00000 +++$+++ "Get the fuck out of my house."
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you?
c00000 +++$+++ An Agent!  You have to send me back!
c00000 +++$+++ To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
c00000 +++$+++ I just want one true adventure before I die.
c00000 +++$+++ You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
c00000 +++$+++ All the adulation?  It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
c00000 +++$+++ Call me later.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
c00000 +++$+++ So I've heard.
c00000 +++$+++ Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
c00000 +++$+++ And the last...?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, just --
c00000 +++$+++ They gave you a pardon, man.  Whatdaya want?
c00000 +++$+++ But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
c00000 +++$+++ I've come now...
c00000 +++$+++ Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
c00000 +++$+++ Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
c00000 +++$+++ I told her. I sounded off.
c00000 +++$+++ What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
c00000 +++$+++ So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
c00000 +++$+++ What the fuck are you.. ?
c00000 +++$+++ And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
c00000 +++$+++ I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
c00000 +++$+++ Hardly. You have six bedrooms
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
c00000 +++$+++ The people downtown said...
c00000 +++$+++ Why not?
c00000 +++$+++ "For"...?
c00000 +++$+++ All right.  Here.
c00000 +++$+++ Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't like it?
c00000 +++$+++ Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
c00000 +++$+++ An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
c00000 +++$+++ Bet you ass...
c00000 +++$+++ Oh?
c00000 +++$+++ I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
c00000 +++$+++ It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
c00000 +++$+++ I never heard about that.
c00000 +++$+++ So you can give us away?
c00000 +++$+++ I wouldn't say "benefit."
c00000 +++$+++ Maureen.
c00000 +++$+++ Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.
c00000 +++$+++ Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
c00000 +++$+++ I moved the couch. That's all.
c00000 +++$+++ Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
c00000 +++$+++ He's dead.
c00000 +++$+++ An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
c00000 +++$+++ If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
c00000 +++$+++ You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
c00000 +++$+++ Him dying like that.
c00000 +++$+++ What is the matter with him?
c00000 +++$+++ I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
c00000 +++$+++ ...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
c00000 +++$+++ Definitely no comment.
c00000 +++$+++ She fucked you?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, I'm not going to let this one get away. He's so cute - collects shells.
c00000 +++$+++ If there was a problem, they could do something right?
c00000 +++$+++ Did you bring the pie and punch?
c00000 +++$+++ If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
c00000 +++$+++ We do make a cute couple, don't we?
c00000 +++$+++ Do you believe in astrology?
c00000 +++$+++ I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh.  Okay.
c00000 +++$+++ You got something on your mind... "brother."
c00000 +++$+++ He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go...Look, come inside and talk...Just for a few minutes.
c00000 +++$+++ What?!
c00000 +++$+++ We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
c00000 +++$+++ I'd die for her.
c00000 +++$+++ I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
c00000 +++$+++ I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
c00000 +++$+++ Because I'm done.
c00000 +++$+++ It gets me through the day.
c00000 +++$+++ Clearly.
c00000 +++$+++ Footloose and fancy free.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ Because that would mean they gave you mine.
c00000 +++$+++ Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
c00000 +++$+++ --six--seven--eight--nine--
c00000 +++$+++ Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
c00000 +++$+++ She's devastated.
c00000 +++$+++ As slaves.
c00000 +++$+++ Randall.
c00000 +++$+++ Off the boulevard.
c00000 +++$+++ Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
c00000 +++$+++ Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
c00000 +++$+++ The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
c00000 +++$+++ We work there!
c00000 +++$+++ I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
c00000 +++$+++ You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
c00000 +++$+++ That depends.  Where are we?
c00000 +++$+++ What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car.
c00000 +++$+++ We've come all this way.  We just have to check it out.  I got a hunch.
c00000 +++$+++ I've seen it. It's all pain.
c00000 +++$+++ But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
c00000 +++$+++ Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
c00000 +++$+++ I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
c00000 +++$+++ Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
c00000 +++$+++ Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
c00000 +++$+++ People can hear you.
c00000 +++$+++ The important thing is, the police won't believe you.
c00000 +++$+++ I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother--
c00000 +++$+++ His foot. Jeez, poor Ronnie...
c00000 +++$+++ I don't believe that. I won't.
c00000 +++$+++ So much for friends, then.  You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
c00000 +++$+++ To do what?
c00000 +++$+++ What are you going to do?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
c00000 +++$+++ My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
c00000 +++$+++ Dad!!
c00000 +++$+++ Nope.
c00000 +++$+++ After everything.
c00000 +++$+++ Let's go overseas . . .
c00000 +++$+++ Don't be a rat, Harry.
c00000 +++$+++ Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
c00000 +++$+++ But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
c00000 +++$+++ Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
c00000 +++$+++ We still having dinner in L.A.?
c00000 +++$+++ No thanks. Plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, and on 'dictis'.
c00000 +++$+++ ... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
c00000 +++$+++ Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
c00000 +++$+++ Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort things out.
c00000 +++$+++ You got that right.
c00000 +++$+++ ...A flaw...
c00000 +++$+++ Which was?
c00000 +++$+++ No.  They say his eligibility ran out years ago.
c00000 +++$+++ And you believe him?
c00000 +++$+++ Your mother was a resident of Saint Catherines home before you moved her.
c00000 +++$+++ Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
c00000 +++$+++ Most people did, yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
c00000 +++$+++ But nothing is happening.
c00000 +++$+++ He's trying to form words.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ The one she wore on her wedding day?
c00000 +++$+++ Shooting?
c00000 +++$+++ All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
c00000 +++$+++ Hold those rights.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes. Now we know.
c00000 +++$+++ Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
c00000 +++$+++ If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
c00000 +++$+++ You helped set up my partner, Sergeant William Wade.  I want to know who put you up to it.
c00000 +++$+++ No, I mentioned it only in passing.
c00000 +++$+++ Then you found the leopard --
c00000 +++$+++ You looked right at her, baby.
c00000 +++$+++ So fuck him. I don't care anymore. Let him come.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah?  Who sent you?
c00000 +++$+++ China.
c00000 +++$+++ So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
c00000 +++$+++ I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
c00000 +++$+++ You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
c00000 +++$+++ Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
c00000 +++$+++ You're really good, you know.
c00000 +++$+++ You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
c00000 +++$+++ That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
c00000 +++$+++ Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
c00000 +++$+++ What's he doing here?
c00000 +++$+++ I need some money right now.
c00000 +++$+++ He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
c00000 +++$+++ I said.  I serve the Queen.
c00000 +++$+++ I already have.
c00000 +++$+++ That's very colorful, chief.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, yeah, thank you, but --
c00000 +++$+++ Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
c00000 +++$+++ The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
c00000 +++$+++ Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
c00000 +++$+++ Good.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
c00000 +++$+++ Was there anyone with you last night?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
c00000 +++$+++ No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
c00000 +++$+++ Mr. Gittes.
c00000 +++$+++ You're nuts.
c00000 +++$+++ So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
c00000 +++$+++ ...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
c00000 +++$+++ As a nurse.
c00000 +++$+++ So where is it?
c00000 +++$+++ And how rusty are these muskets?
c00000 +++$+++ Sweet.
c00000 +++$+++ Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
c00000 +++$+++ Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
c00000 +++$+++ You said you were on leave for the Fourth.
c00000 +++$+++ Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
c00000 +++$+++ Biederman!
c00000 +++$+++ You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
c00000 +++$+++ Norman took a wife?
c00000 +++$+++ It isn't all! I'd like to explain--
c00000 +++$+++ You can't...
c00000 +++$+++ How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
c00000 +++$+++ We have to talk.
c00000 +++$+++ I've been in here before.
c00000 +++$+++ Carry them to England to your King with pride.
c00000 +++$+++ How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
c00000 +++$+++ What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
c00000 +++$+++ No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
c00000 +++$+++ All night?
c00000 +++$+++ I said I like all of them.
c00000 +++$+++ Goodnight, Kringelein.
c00000 +++$+++ Why do you say that?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
c00000 +++$+++ And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
c00000 +++$+++ Certainly, but...
c00000 +++$+++ What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
c00000 +++$+++ Lonesome?
c00000 +++$+++ You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car.  He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
c00000 +++$+++ We?
c00000 +++$+++ You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
c00000 +++$+++ He offered you money?
c00000 +++$+++ It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
c00000 +++$+++ Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
c00000 +++$+++ Did any difficulties of any kind arise during the trip?
c00000 +++$+++ Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
c00000 +++$+++ Why not?
c00000 +++$+++ Uh, oh. Now it's time.
c00000 +++$+++ That will never happen.
c00000 +++$+++ Certainly, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
c00000 +++$+++ You gonna stay out here?
c00000 +++$+++ Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
c00000 +++$+++ A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.
c00000 +++$+++ I am all attention.
c00000 +++$+++ Rangers, eh?
c00000 +++$+++ Uh-huh. He's the, uh...
c00000 +++$+++ Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?
c00000 +++$+++ We'll never find the Baron's castle.
c00000 +++$+++ Is it loaded?
c00000 +++$+++ I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
c00000 +++$+++ Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
c00000 +++$+++ Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, it could be adorable...
c00000 +++$+++ Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
c00000 +++$+++ I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
c00000 +++$+++ But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
c00000 +++$+++ I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go?
c00000 +++$+++ And then what happened?
c00000 +++$+++ Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
c00000 +++$+++ But I don't understand...
c00000 +++$+++ Uh huh.
c00000 +++$+++ Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
c00000 +++$+++ Fair's fair.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  I didn't confess today.
c00000 +++$+++ We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
c00000 +++$+++ Guess again, copper.
c00000 +++$+++ Huh?
c00000 +++$+++ Would they do that?
c00000 +++$+++ I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
c00000 +++$+++ Not that I know.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
c00000 +++$+++ You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
c00000 +++$+++ That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
c00000 +++$+++ Where's Star, David?!
c00000 +++$+++ You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
c00000 +++$+++ When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know.
c00000 +++$+++ No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
c00000 +++$+++ What call?
c00000 +++$+++ If she pisses you off, you get another one.
c00000 +++$+++ Everything?
c00000 +++$+++ Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
c00000 +++$+++ Uh, why, why are you doing this?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
c00000 +++$+++ Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
c00000 +++$+++ He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
c00000 +++$+++ ...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
c00000 +++$+++ They've had a little car trouble. I'm afraid they won't be here until after dark.
c00000 +++$+++ They're stragglin'.
c00000 +++$+++ How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
c00000 +++$+++ Is that a fact.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not-
c00000 +++$+++ LaMagra --
c00000 +++$+++ What if she forgets?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
c00000 +++$+++ If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
c00000 +++$+++ Well...
c00000 +++$+++ Oh yeah, why?
c00000 +++$+++ That's really strange. What does it mean?
c00000 +++$+++ Never to put you in my will.
c00000 +++$+++ He's out of prison?
c00000 +++$+++ You've heard Beethoven before?
c00000 +++$+++ Is that right?
c00000 +++$+++ Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
c00000 +++$+++ I will not betray you, Nathanael.
c00000 +++$+++ You do.
c00000 +++$+++ Yah.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
c00000 +++$+++ What else?  From Virginia?
c00000 +++$+++ But Dad'll never go for it.
c00000 +++$+++ Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
c00000 +++$+++ That's blackmail.
c00000 +++$+++ Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
c00000 +++$+++ We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
c00000 +++$+++ Of course.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not hungry, oddly.
c00000 +++$+++ Surely you knew this was coming.
c00000 +++$+++ Huh?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm just on vacation.
c00000 +++$+++ I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or...
c00000 +++$+++ Now what did you lose?
c00000 +++$+++ Well now you do.
c00000 +++$+++ They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
c00000 +++$+++ I got an audition, I won't make it here 'till two, c'mon, I'll see you later. Love you.
c00000 +++$+++ The Doctors were not negligent.
c00000 +++$+++ And her farmhouse...?
c00000 +++$+++ 'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
c00000 +++$+++ Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But -- trust me, it's not gonna happen!
c00000 +++$+++ We've got a -
c00000 +++$+++ I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
c00000 +++$+++ He will not permit anyone but me to see him. You must be outside this room.... Do what you can.
c00000 +++$+++ He's around someplace.
c00000 +++$+++ Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
c00000 +++$+++ ... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
c00000 +++$+++ Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
c00000 +++$+++ Never!  I'm going in and ask him--
c00000 +++$+++ Wait a minute --
c00000 +++$+++ We'll send for the police!
c00000 +++$+++ What're you talking about?  We have that.
c00000 +++$+++ Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
c00000 +++$+++ Who ... Who breaks out?
c00000 +++$+++ Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
c00000 +++$+++ Apparently she was very disappointed.
c00000 +++$+++ What about Redfoot?
c00000 +++$+++ Good.  Can you bring me to him?
c00000 +++$+++ I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
c00000 +++$+++ Do it.  If that's what all this carnage is about, then do it.  Have enough guts to do it.
c00000 +++$+++ No, sir.
c00000 +++$+++ Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
c00000 +++$+++ You want that?
c00000 +++$+++ At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
c00000 +++$+++ Oh yes! It was wonderful!
c00000 +++$+++ We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
c00000 +++$+++ I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
c00000 +++$+++ What is this?
c00000 +++$+++ Okay.
c00000 +++$+++ That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
c00000 +++$+++ Elaine, what's going on?
c00000 +++$+++ Pablo said no?
c00000 +++$+++ Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
c00000 +++$+++ It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not the police.
c00000 +++$+++ You feel sorry for the husband?
c00000 +++$+++ Are we smart enough to avoid that?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.
c00000 +++$+++ I know. It won't go unnoticed.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm cool.
c00000 +++$+++ So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
c00000 +++$+++ It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
c00000 +++$+++ Five minutes and fifty seconds.
c00000 +++$+++ Who gave you this idea?
c00000 +++$+++ It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
c00000 +++$+++ Keystone what?
c00000 +++$+++ Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
c00000 +++$+++ -- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
c00000 +++$+++ He hit you?
c00000 +++$+++ You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
c00000 +++$+++ Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
c00000 +++$+++ <u>So what are we doing</u>?
c00000 +++$+++ Waal...
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure I did ... once.  It turned out lousy.
c00000 +++$+++ Your grandmother?
c00000 +++$+++ Not her brand.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing well enough to turn away business! More power to ya, brother! The public be damned!
c00000 +++$+++ Change my name.
c00000 +++$+++ Viceroy of the West Indies.
c00000 +++$+++ Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
c00000 +++$+++ Where ya goin', Mac?
c00000 +++$+++ Leon could still have hung himself.
c00000 +++$+++ Only you. and the photo lab.
c00000 +++$+++ Let me see if it changes colors on me.
c00000 +++$+++ But I didn't do it - don't you believe me?
c00000 +++$+++ For an introduction.
c00000 +++$+++ Let's have a look, do you mind?
c00000 +++$+++ It was Beethoven's Ninth.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
c00000 +++$+++ If you really mean it, I will.
c00000 +++$+++ Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
c00000 +++$+++ No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
c00000 +++$+++ I like the tent better.
c00000 +++$+++ Ten thousand sounds high.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll be delighted.
c00000 +++$+++ Meaning?
c00000 +++$+++ What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
c00000 +++$+++ ...OK.
c00000 +++$+++ Kenny's aunt?
c00000 +++$+++ I'll look around and catch up later.
c00000 +++$+++ Believe it.  Now bring me the trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
c00000 +++$+++ I know where you're going.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
c00000 +++$+++ Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
c00000 +++$+++ I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe you didn't notice, but this is a prison.
c00000 +++$+++ I think I've been hurt.
c00000 +++$+++ First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
c00000 +++$+++ I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
c00000 +++$+++ I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
c00000 +++$+++ You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
c00000 +++$+++ Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
c00000 +++$+++ Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
c00000 +++$+++ I promise.
c00000 +++$+++ Hemingway.  You?
c00000 +++$+++ Not for three-fifty.
c00000 +++$+++ Me neither.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes...
c00000 +++$+++ Sure am.
c00000 +++$+++ I want to sleep... forever...
c00000 +++$+++ Oh I know that. How does it go...
c00000 +++$+++ Sir, let those laugh that win.
c00000 +++$+++ -- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
c00000 +++$+++ Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
c00000 +++$+++ Almost three.
c00000 +++$+++ The other side.
c00000 +++$+++ You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
c00000 +++$+++ OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk.
c00000 +++$+++ Which <i>Times</i> guy?
c00000 +++$+++ Sorry.
c00000 +++$+++ Huh! Really? Hotels?
c00000 +++$+++ Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
c00000 +++$+++ I couldn't do it.
c00000 +++$+++ Your police are at the gate?
c00000 +++$+++ No. I never was.
c00000 +++$+++ No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
c00000 +++$+++ Or you could try lying down.
c00000 +++$+++ From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
c00000 +++$+++ Tell me, who is your master?
c00000 +++$+++ You are very important, Willow.
c00000 +++$+++ ...who say...?
c00000 +++$+++ Just a second, Mr. President.
c00000 +++$+++ Why not?
c00000 +++$+++ Seat 74.
c00000 +++$+++ No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
c00000 +++$+++ They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
c00000 +++$+++ Then, it's all over?
c00000 +++$+++ Did you know her?
c00000 +++$+++ The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
c00000 +++$+++ Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
c00000 +++$+++ Miss me?
c00000 +++$+++ You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
c00000 +++$+++ You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
c00000 +++$+++ You're entitled to your opinion.
c00000 +++$+++ And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
c00000 +++$+++ I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
c00000 +++$+++ Nice neighborhood.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't want to hear about her anymore.
c00000 +++$+++ With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
c00000 +++$+++ Seven o'clock?
c00000 +++$+++ You climb damn it, or so help me I'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
c00000 +++$+++ Well . . . ?
c00000 +++$+++ No you're not.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll be back in 137 hours.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know, why?
c00000 +++$+++ You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
c00000 +++$+++ We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
c00000 +++$+++ Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe he wants something.
c00000 +++$+++ And people make their choice--
c00000 +++$+++ Is it terribly erotic?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
c00000 +++$+++ Just relax....
c00000 +++$+++ But, I...
c00000 +++$+++ I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
c00000 +++$+++ Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
c00000 +++$+++ Are you sure?
c00000 +++$+++ Sir?
c00000 +++$+++ Followed by non-human manifestations.
c00000 +++$+++ Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
c00000 +++$+++ Think it was a guilding. It was grey. Oh it was so beautiful, the guy let me ride it all around.
c00000 +++$+++ Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
c00000 +++$+++ He says it's a bad idea!
c00000 +++$+++ Happy birthday.
c00000 +++$+++ Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
c00000 +++$+++ But-what if I can't...?
c00000 +++$+++ Pullin' ah pants down...
c00000 +++$+++ Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
c00000 +++$+++ You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
c00000 +++$+++ There's nothing I can say for one small child?
c00000 +++$+++ Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
c00000 +++$+++ All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
c00000 +++$+++ I said, she's in great shape.
c00000 +++$+++ The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
c00000 +++$+++ That depends.
c00000 +++$+++ No! He's a real gardener!
c00000 +++$+++ Can I give her a message?
c00000 +++$+++ According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
c00000 +++$+++ And listen, don't do anything else crazy, okay? You all right? Okay.
c00000 +++$+++ Let's work on it.
c00000 +++$+++ Who?
c00000 +++$+++ Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
c00000 +++$+++ There are reasons for the way we do things here.
c00000 +++$+++ Ready for what?  Sight-seeing?
c00000 +++$+++ Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
c00000 +++$+++ No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
c00000 +++$+++ Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
c00000 +++$+++ That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, he's a keeper all right.
c00000 +++$+++ Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
c00000 +++$+++ Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
c00000 +++$+++ I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over.  See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
c00000 +++$+++ There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
c00000 +++$+++ More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
c00000 +++$+++ You know darn well it is.
c00000 +++$+++ And it's a shorter commute.
c00000 +++$+++ NO. I SAY KNOCK-KNOCK! You say who's there. I say who's there and then you say who who. You're not playing right.  Knock-knock.
c00000 +++$+++ It's important.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, I know.
c00000 +++$+++ -- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
c00000 +++$+++ Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
c00000 +++$+++ There's more than one?
c00000 +++$+++ What the heck do you mean?
c00000 +++$+++ That's very generous.
c00000 +++$+++ You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
c00000 +++$+++ Then we'll just have a peek at the wounds.  Dig 'em up!
c00000 +++$+++ It's a shame.  He's such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
c00000 +++$+++ This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
c00000 +++$+++ Shouldn't I go?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, pretty well.
c00000 +++$+++ Sleepy suddenly.
c00000 +++$+++ You and Kevin.
c00000 +++$+++ As far away as I ever want to be.
c00000 +++$+++ So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, huh?
c00000 +++$+++ Why you think is today?
c00000 +++$+++ But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
c00000 +++$+++ Oooh...
c00000 +++$+++ If it is an alien spacecraft --
c00000 +++$+++ You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
c00000 +++$+++ Your last chance. Give me the name.
c00000 +++$+++ If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
c00000 +++$+++ I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
c00000 +++$+++ Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
c00000 +++$+++ Don't worry about that.  Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
c00000 +++$+++ Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
c00000 +++$+++ How nice.
c00000 +++$+++ Stay... stay away!
c00000 +++$+++ Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
c00000 +++$+++ So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
c00000 +++$+++ Forget it!
c00000 +++$+++ Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
c00000 +++$+++ You mean a shithead.
c00000 +++$+++ Remember how they used to stick out?
c00000 +++$+++ You're as bad as my father.
c00000 +++$+++ Can I trust you?
c00000 +++$+++ I just can't believe it.
c00000 +++$+++ Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
c00000 +++$+++ ..."The Devil?"...
c00000 +++$+++ Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
c00000 +++$+++ ... love ...
c00000 +++$+++ My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
c00000 +++$+++ I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm twenty-two.
c00000 +++$+++ What?
c00000 +++$+++ I might not be able to.
c00000 +++$+++ Is that what you want?
c00000 +++$+++ That's what I'm talking about.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
c00000 +++$+++ Look, what I'm trying to say --
c00000 +++$+++ And... where are things?
c00000 +++$+++ Then take the pills.
c00000 +++$+++ Want to ask him?
c00000 +++$+++ I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
c00000 +++$+++ No, thank you.
c00000 +++$+++ I really don't know.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
c00000 +++$+++ Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
c00000 +++$+++ Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
c00000 +++$+++ What do you mean you can't?
c00000 +++$+++ Wouldn't be no use. I'd still see 'em inside the tent.
c00000 +++$+++ Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
c00000 +++$+++ Then where's the money?
c00000 +++$+++ Pitbull attacks.
c00000 +++$+++ 'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
c00000 +++$+++ Slow down, huh?
c00000 +++$+++ That's perfectly clear.
c00000 +++$+++ Meaning what?
c00000 +++$+++ Me?
c00000 +++$+++ No thanks.
c00000 +++$+++ And now you'll provide them.
c00000 +++$+++ That's right.
c00000 +++$+++ Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand.  I'm going to take a walk and dry off.
c00000 +++$+++ PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
c00000 +++$+++ This can't be happening?
c00000 +++$+++ What happened to it?
c00000 +++$+++ If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
c00000 +++$+++ Dealing
c00000 +++$+++ Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
c00000 +++$+++ No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
c00000 +++$+++ --it's less than four feet, just--
c00000 +++$+++ It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
c00000 +++$+++ Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
c00000 +++$+++ That's not it.
c00000 +++$+++ Can you give me a drink, please?
c00000 +++$+++ I'll catch up with you.
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
c00000 +++$+++ No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
c00000 +++$+++ Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
c00000 +++$+++ Uh-huh.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
c00000 +++$+++ No.  I'm just being friendly.
c00000 +++$+++ I mean, I am really attracted to you.
c00000 +++$+++ It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
c00000 +++$+++ You look tired....
c00000 +++$+++ He is very good.
c00000 +++$+++ Mr. Kramer, there's--
c00000 +++$+++ Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
c00000 +++$+++ When? Tonight?
c00000 +++$+++ What's your theory?
c00000 +++$+++ That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
c00000 +++$+++ But everything that's happening is good! You can be a part of it!
c00000 +++$+++ It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
c00000 +++$+++ A transmission?
c00000 +++$+++ You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
c00000 +++$+++ Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
c00000 +++$+++ What do you see?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
c00000 +++$+++ What about that diamond wrist watch she had on--she can raise some money on that?
c00000 +++$+++ Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???
c00000 +++$+++ Theo wants to talk again.
c00000 +++$+++ 'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
c00000 +++$+++ Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
c00000 +++$+++ Do you need anything else?
c00000 +++$+++ She made it through S.E.R.E. training.  Got a call this morning from --
c00000 +++$+++ And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
c00000 +++$+++ So what makes you so special?
c00000 +++$+++ Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
c00000 +++$+++ If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
c00000 +++$+++ Sure. Excellent.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you want?
c00000 +++$+++ You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
c00000 +++$+++ How did the wall get there?
c00000 +++$+++ Can we charge admission?
c00000 +++$+++ Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
c00000 +++$+++ I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
c00000 +++$+++ What time is it?
c00000 +++$+++ Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know, I don't care.
c00000 +++$+++ I like my horizons narrow.
c00000 +++$+++ It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
c00000 +++$+++ Artie! Artie!
c00000 +++$+++ It's worth it.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
c00000 +++$+++ You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
c00000 +++$+++ One.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
c00000 +++$+++ Like Custer huh?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't believe you.
c00000 +++$+++ Jeff...
c00000 +++$+++ So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
c00000 +++$+++ There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
c00000 +++$+++ Everything?
c00000 +++$+++ Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
c00000 +++$+++ You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
c00000 +++$+++ You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
c00000 +++$+++ What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
c00000 +++$+++ How 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
c00000 +++$+++ The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
c00000 +++$+++ Twenty minutes...
c00000 +++$+++ I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
c00000 +++$+++ Well, go get 'em, Pops.
c00000 +++$+++ Myra, I'm not following this.
c00000 +++$+++ What makes you so sure?
c00000 +++$+++ Look, would you argue with your doctor?
c00000 +++$+++ It's his name.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
c00000 +++$+++ Shut up.
c00000 +++$+++ Falling.
c00000 +++$+++ All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
c00000 +++$+++ No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
c00000 +++$+++ Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, that's what I mean.
c00000 +++$+++ He should.
c00000 +++$+++ Howard.
c00000 +++$+++ Counselor, you're insulting me.
c00000 +++$+++ Does she, goddamnit??
c00000 +++$+++ Give that back to me.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? Look at you.
c00000 +++$+++ What are you talking about?
c00000 +++$+++ You'll take fifty and like it!
c00000 +++$+++ Lie back down, and try to -
c00000 +++$+++ I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a -- confronto -- line-up.  Tomorrow then?
c00000 +++$+++ Please, call me Gale.
c00000 +++$+++ She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
c00000 +++$+++ Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
c00000 +++$+++ Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe our biggest. I'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
c00000 +++$+++ If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll get my purse.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure you are.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure.
c00000 +++$+++ No... what about your sister?
c00000 +++$+++ But...who...
c00000 +++$+++ You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
c00000 +++$+++ Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
c00000 +++$+++ May I try it?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know if there's anything we can do.
c00000 +++$+++ I can't be honest with them.
c00000 +++$+++ That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
c00000 +++$+++ Uh-huh. And?
c00000 +++$+++ Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
c00000 +++$+++ Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do I?
c00000 +++$+++ Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
c00000 +++$+++ Where are you?
c00000 +++$+++ And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
c00000 +++$+++ No, I don't have one.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, but Charlie -
c00000 +++$+++ Huh?
c00000 +++$+++ Shut up.
c00000 +++$+++ It was a payoff and an insult.  InGen never--
c00000 +++$+++ Yes I do.
c00000 +++$+++ <u>Niente!</u>
c00000 +++$+++ You made a fool out of me! In front of the FBI!
c00000 +++$+++ You saw that?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't believe this.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay.
c00000 +++$+++ But surely you must know -- because I love you.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes. Very close
c00000 +++$+++ -- where's left to go? --
c00000 +++$+++ Calm down, you're not ...
c00000 +++$+++ Nothing?
c00000 +++$+++ Who do you think I am?
c00000 +++$+++ Get up.
c00000 +++$+++ Great. That's great.
c00000 +++$+++ You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
c00000 +++$+++ I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
c00000 +++$+++ Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
c00000 +++$+++ It's ok to ask that.
c00000 +++$+++ Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
c00000 +++$+++ Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
c00000 +++$+++ I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
c00000 +++$+++ Are we in Brooklyn?
c00000 +++$+++ Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
c00000 +++$+++ That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
c00000 +++$+++ The guy might not have been carrying anything.
c00000 +++$+++ Think he bought it?
c00000 +++$+++ So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
c00000 +++$+++ I...
c00000 +++$+++ I know.
c00000 +++$+++ With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
c00000 +++$+++ I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
c00000 +++$+++ What shit, honey?
c00000 +++$+++ They're fine.
c00000 +++$+++ Really.  What'll I pin this on?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, then, how could he write that roast?  The notices in the Kane papers were always very kind to her.
c00000 +++$+++ What shall we do?
c00000 +++$+++ Why do you say that?
c00000 +++$+++ Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
c00000 +++$+++ ...as of today, 89% favorable.
c00000 +++$+++ When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
c00000 +++$+++ "And" what?
c00000 +++$+++ I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
c00000 +++$+++ ...Nah.
c00000 +++$+++ Really!
c00000 +++$+++ If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
c00000 +++$+++ Wash up and go home.
c00000 +++$+++ Three...
c00000 +++$+++ You can have one.
c00000 +++$+++ Quietly.
c00000 +++$+++ Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
c00000 +++$+++ You used that excuse to get out of the army.
c00000 +++$+++ It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
c00000 +++$+++ Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
c00000 +++$+++ Because you promised.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
c00000 +++$+++ They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
c00000 +++$+++ A mutant species.
c00000 +++$+++ Insane.
c00000 +++$+++ But --
c00000 +++$+++ That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
c00000 +++$+++ That hair will have to go.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
c00000 +++$+++ She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
c00000 +++$+++ No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
c00000 +++$+++ I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
c00000 +++$+++ Surrounded by living tissue.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
c00000 +++$+++ No way, man.
c00000 +++$+++ Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
c00000 +++$+++ We could live it up and --
c00000 +++$+++ Well, shall we get down to it?
c00000 +++$+++ Do they have to look so...robotic?
c00000 +++$+++ No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
c00000 +++$+++ No!
c00000 +++$+++ Look, I appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, I can take care of myself.
c00000 +++$+++ But he won't shoot you right then?
c00000 +++$+++ There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
c00000 +++$+++ No.... I don't...
c00000 +++$+++ So?
c00000 +++$+++ I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
c00000 +++$+++ Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
c00000 +++$+++ don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in--
c00000 +++$+++ Huh?
c00000 +++$+++ What are you trying to say?
c00000 +++$+++ Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
c00000 +++$+++ One for all -- all for one --
c00000 +++$+++ No way Phil.  Not like this.
c00000 +++$+++ Halfdan the Black.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
c00000 +++$+++ THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
c00000 +++$+++ To new worlds...
c00000 +++$+++ I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
c00000 +++$+++ Ash?
c00000 +++$+++ Will you take of f your blouse?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
c00000 +++$+++ You want a wip-it?
c00000 +++$+++ Would you excuse me?
c00000 +++$+++ Will you be here?
c00000 +++$+++ M.F.E.O.?
c00000 +++$+++ What'll it be? The regular? Black Label?
c00000 +++$+++ I have thought about you.
c00000 +++$+++ Huh?  I...uh...uh...
c00000 +++$+++ Forget it, Frances. You're not driving.
c00000 +++$+++ So what's the question?
c00000 +++$+++ Kim Dae Yung. North Korean Nuclear specialist.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
c00000 +++$+++ I found it.
c00000 +++$+++ High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
c00000 +++$+++ Izzat right?
c00000 +++$+++ That's the boy.
c00000 +++$+++ ...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
c00000 +++$+++ Black.  Labrador.
c00000 +++$+++ He just wants to --
c00000 +++$+++ Dan keeping you up again?  Put a lock on that window, girl.
c00000 +++$+++ No, we're not.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't think...
c00000 +++$+++ They kid a lot.
c00000 +++$+++ But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
c00000 +++$+++ Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
c00000 +++$+++ Great.
c00000 +++$+++ Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me. She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
c00000 +++$+++ Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
c00000 +++$+++ I have to tell you.  It's strange.
c00000 +++$+++ I mean pulling a stunt like that.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
c00000 +++$+++ It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one--
c00000 +++$+++ Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
c00000 +++$+++ A dozen times.
c00000 +++$+++ But why him?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
c00000 +++$+++ Stolen?
c00000 +++$+++ These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
c00000 +++$+++ I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
c00000 +++$+++ You know what we want.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
c00000 +++$+++ Could he handle a direct contact?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, Master!
c00000 +++$+++ An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
c00000 +++$+++ It was quite a page turner.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not catching a melody.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you like him?
c00000 +++$+++ Uh, ma'am.
c00000 +++$+++ Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
c00000 +++$+++ I haven't.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
c00000 +++$+++ This is a great young out-of-work actress.
c00000 +++$+++ I love you, honey.
c00000 +++$+++ Can you give the court an example?
c00000 +++$+++ I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
c00000 +++$+++ You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
c00000 +++$+++ Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
c00000 +++$+++ No, I don't have anything to show you. I'm here from a mental hospital.
c00000 +++$+++ ...it's a Teaser!
c00000 +++$+++ Why not?
c00000 +++$+++ You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
c00000 +++$+++ :...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
c00000 +++$+++ Fletch, I never sold nothing.
c00000 +++$+++ Really?  What have you been doing?
c00000 +++$+++ The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
c00000 +++$+++ Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
c00000 +++$+++ That's all!
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe in a day or so when I'm not so emotional ...
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't do enough.
c00000 +++$+++ Bright enough to be dangerous.
c00000 +++$+++ From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
c00000 +++$+++ What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
c00000 +++$+++ Something pretty.
c00000 +++$+++ No.  A chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  I think it was bothered by my light.
c00000 +++$+++ The place is crawling with Hoovers.
c00000 +++$+++ ...Forty thousand dollars!
c00000 +++$+++ You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
c00000 +++$+++ That's what I want ...
c00000 +++$+++ You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
c00000 +++$+++ Told you to stay in the hotel!
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I... uh...
c00000 +++$+++ You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.
c00000 +++$+++ Now hold on, Baxter --
c00000 +++$+++ -- or lack thereof?
c00000 +++$+++ I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
c00000 +++$+++ No - absinthe.
c00000 +++$+++ I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
c00000 +++$+++ I guess so.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm thinking!
c00000 +++$+++ Why not?
c00000 +++$+++ Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
c00000 +++$+++ Not yet.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
c00000 +++$+++ How?!
c00000 +++$+++ It's stupid.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, no... not just, not only.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you have a good answer?
c00000 +++$+++ You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
c00000 +++$+++ Congratulations.
c00000 +++$+++ Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
c00000 +++$+++ Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
c00000 +++$+++ Why does he call you that?
c00000 +++$+++ A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
c00000 +++$+++ It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
c00000 +++$+++ About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  I'm putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
c00000 +++$+++ Of course, senor.
c00000 +++$+++ It can't be as bad as that.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
c00000 +++$+++ Quod nomen mihi est?
c00000 +++$+++ There's nothing to worry about....
c00000 +++$+++ "Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, you do.
c00000 +++$+++ Please...
c00000 +++$+++ So you saved her.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
c00000 +++$+++ Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
c00000 +++$+++ This Vulcan -- is he alive?
c00000 +++$+++ Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
c00000 +++$+++ <i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
c00000 +++$+++ They always seemed...
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
c00000 +++$+++ And that was only my first try.
c00000 +++$+++ And what about the reconfiguration?
c00000 +++$+++ You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
c00000 +++$+++ Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh my God. I'm so dead...
c00000 +++$+++ You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
c00000 +++$+++ For what purpose?
c00000 +++$+++ Everything was different.
c00000 +++$+++ If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay... You need anything, just call.
c00000 +++$+++ They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal.  Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
c00000 +++$+++ You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing new.
c00000 +++$+++ I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
c00000 +++$+++ Where is he?
c00000 +++$+++ Why?  If they could never take title.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't tell him you're here.
c00000 +++$+++ How old are you?
c00000 +++$+++ You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
c00000 +++$+++ I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
c00000 +++$+++ Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
c00000 +++$+++ I haven't seen him in two years.
c00000 +++$+++ No. If anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ Front page?
c00000 +++$+++ Three years.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm going to the store.
c00000 +++$+++ Fuck off.
c00000 +++$+++ How did you meet her?
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
c00000 +++$+++ Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
c00000 +++$+++ Okay?
c00000 +++$+++ Uh uh! What did we talk about?
c00000 +++$+++ They put their hands all over me.
c00000 +++$+++ Four.
c00000 +++$+++ Babies
c00000 +++$+++ Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
c00000 +++$+++ I found a picture of his wife.
c00000 +++$+++ Lost.
c00000 +++$+++ Theory, partner...If it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...Confuse it...Drive it away....
c00000 +++$+++ What will I tell the others? They care about you.
c00000 +++$+++ Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
c00000 +++$+++ All this because of that whore!
c00000 +++$+++ You jivin' me?
c00000 +++$+++ Are you threatening me?
c00000 +++$+++ I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, Harold.
c00000 +++$+++ What was this one?
c00000 +++$+++ You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
c00000 +++$+++ Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't believe this.
c00000 +++$+++ He's so great, <u>you</u> hire him.
c00000 +++$+++ No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
c00000 +++$+++ Why you dogging me up?
c00000 +++$+++ So can I come along?
c00000 +++$+++ But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
c00000 +++$+++ No word at all?
c00000 +++$+++ No... I want to stay with you...
c00000 +++$+++ You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
c00000 +++$+++ Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
c00000 +++$+++ What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, Mother, not the castor oil.
c00000 +++$+++ Yep.
c00000 +++$+++ Um...sure.
c00000 +++$+++ Think you could do a picture of me?
c00000 +++$+++ In a corridor.
c00000 +++$+++ But suppose I lose?  Suppose it's an emergency?
c00000 +++$+++ No, Jeff.  You don't.  He's not a murderer, I tell you.  He;s not a murderer.
c00000 +++$+++ He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
c00000 +++$+++ There were treating me like a headcase.
c00000 +++$+++ But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
c00000 +++$+++ The police?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh no. In the car you did it?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
c00000 +++$+++ I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
c00000 +++$+++ How long have you been smoking?
c00000 +++$+++ I don't know. Everyone's dead...
c00000 +++$+++ I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
c00000 +++$+++ Margo hasn't done badly by it.
c00000 +++$+++ Have a good trip.
c00000 +++$+++ All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
c00000 +++$+++ We see each other every couple of months.
c00000 +++$+++ Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
c00000 +++$+++ Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
c00000 +++$+++ Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you?
c00000 +++$+++ Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
c00000 +++$+++ For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
c00000 +++$+++ Chicken?
c00000 +++$+++ SUSIE...?  Are you alright...?
c00000 +++$+++ Wine, women and song.
c00000 +++$+++ The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
c00000 +++$+++ Would you care to be more specific?
c00000 +++$+++ Do me a favor.  Go to work.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
c00000 +++$+++ No...no.
c00000 +++$+++ You weren't attracted to him at all?
c00000 +++$+++ I like the way you talk.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
c00000 +++$+++ Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
c00000 +++$+++ I mean, screw them, you know?  I'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
c00000 +++$+++ I must take you to an emergency ward sometime--on a Saturday night. That's also fun.  I came to see Selma, as a matter of fact.
c00000 +++$+++ How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
c00000 +++$+++ Don't know that either.
c00000 +++$+++ Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
c00000 +++$+++ With that ten thousand dollars I could build a Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
c00000 +++$+++ Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
c00000 +++$+++ Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
c00000 +++$+++ Bag this fucker Buzzy.
c00000 +++$+++ Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
c00000 +++$+++ I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
c00000 +++$+++ All right, then...
c00000 +++$+++ I thought Jason was only a legend?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out...
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I feel better about this now.
c00000 +++$+++ Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
c00000 +++$+++ Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
c00000 +++$+++ Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
c00000 +++$+++ Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
c00000 +++$+++ Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
c00000 +++$+++ Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm fine.
c00000 +++$+++ No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon's story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
c00000 +++$+++ I'll throw that in too.
c00000 +++$+++ Some of the old songs, Sam.
c00000 +++$+++ Go on.
c00000 +++$+++ I want to talk to you.
c00000 +++$+++ Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
c00000 +++$+++ It's important.
c00000 +++$+++ None of your business, but it's in the cab.  That's all mine.  When we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
c00000 +++$+++ Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
c00000 +++$+++ Whatever you want.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't believe you have "things."
c00000 +++$+++ Why?
c00000 +++$+++ Alright?
c00000 +++$+++ Just about anything, Walter.
c00000 +++$+++ ...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
c00000 +++$+++ I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
c00000 +++$+++ Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
c00000 +++$+++ Right.
c00000 +++$+++ Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
c00000 +++$+++ -- what kind?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you. I haven't wrung a chicken's neck in a month of Sundays. You know, folks would call my daddy to kill their hogs. That used to be my trade from time to time.
c00000 +++$+++ Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
c00000 +++$+++ I can take care of myself.  You know that.
c00000 +++$+++ Miles, it's Sunday.  You promised to take the kids to Raging Waters today.
c00000 +++$+++ But obviously you still care what happens to him.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
c00000 +++$+++ What if he wants to get out?
c00000 +++$+++ I'd forgotten.
c00000 +++$+++ You'd better call and cancel.
c00000 +++$+++ No, haven't heard of it.
c00000 +++$+++ Thursday.
c00000 +++$+++ You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?
c00000 +++$+++ And you haven't heard the last of this!
c00000 +++$+++ Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
c00000 +++$+++ I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life!  Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
c00000 +++$+++ Give me Ruben back...
c00000 +++$+++ But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
c00000 +++$+++ Didn't want you.
c00000 +++$+++ Are you crazy?!
c00000 +++$+++ Say what you're saying.
c00000 +++$+++ Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
c00000 +++$+++ -Okay okay.
c00000 +++$+++ She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
c00000 +++$+++ Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, yes, you are. It's been two hundred years since an Indian has cocked a snoot at the British Empire and got away with it. And stop calling me Mr. Patel, you're not a junior clerk anymore.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe I did... I don't remember.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't like the song.
c00000 +++$+++ I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
c00000 +++$+++ Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
c00000 +++$+++ He's still pissed off about it.
c00000 +++$+++ What is it?
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
c00000 +++$+++ A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
c00000 +++$+++ You mean when I'm not working on a...
c00000 +++$+++ I know, but -
c00000 +++$+++ Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
c00000 +++$+++ It's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
c00000 +++$+++ Every day.
c00000 +++$+++ Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
c00000 +++$+++ Here's the ring.
c00000 +++$+++ But those are my roommate's sodas...
c00000 +++$+++ I don't drink coffee...
c00000 +++$+++ Would you take me back? Would they?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, yes.  It would be interesting. A nice cheer.
c00000 +++$+++ Before what?
c00000 +++$+++ It's in the main ballroom.
c00000 +++$+++ So, on to the Life Of Christ!
c00000 +++$+++ Fucking drunk, huh?
c00000 +++$+++ The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
c00000 +++$+++ When you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
c00000 +++$+++ "I die knowing no one knew the real me."
c00000 +++$+++ So?
c00000 +++$+++ Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
c00000 +++$+++ It's late.
c00000 +++$+++ From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
c00000 +++$+++ Then what happened?
c00000 +++$+++ No.
c00000 +++$+++ Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
c00000 +++$+++ You weren't there, you don't know what happened.
c00000 +++$+++ Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
c00000 +++$+++ Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
c00000 +++$+++ Like your story is over.
c00000 +++$+++ Makes your breath like garbage.
c00000 +++$+++ How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
c00000 +++$+++ Salvatore. Always holding himself above.
c00000 +++$+++ What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
c00000 +++$+++ No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
c00000 +++$+++ I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
c00000 +++$+++ What's that?
c00000 +++$+++ My, my... Ah, who are you?
c00000 +++$+++ I'll ask.
c00000 +++$+++ Can you do that?
c00000 +++$+++ Good lookin'?
c00000 +++$+++ ...What?
c00000 +++$+++ You got it.
c00000 +++$+++ Where?
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
c00000 +++$+++ That's ridiculous.
c00000 +++$+++ Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
c00000 +++$+++ GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
c00000 +++$+++ But don't they have it in English?
c00000 +++$+++ I wish it could all have been different.
c00000 +++$+++ Anna, what are you trying to say...
c00000 +++$+++ You better not be fucking teasing me.
c00000 +++$+++ Everything is gone, now.
c00000 +++$+++ I suppose you're right.
c00000 +++$+++ And that's not the same thing?
c00000 +++$+++ Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
c00000 +++$+++ I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
c00000 +++$+++ Burn them.
c00000 +++$+++ Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do.
c00000 +++$+++ Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
c00000 +++$+++ Must have missed the sign.
c00000 +++$+++ Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
c00000 +++$+++ If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
c00000 +++$+++ Three.
c00000 +++$+++ Falling.
c00000 +++$+++ Did you worry about him?
c00000 +++$+++ Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
c00000 +++$+++ Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
c00000 +++$+++ What'd you do, piss your pants?
c00000 +++$+++ Neil, thank you for your help.
c00000 +++$+++ Of course not.
c00000 +++$+++ Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
c00000 +++$+++ I'm sorry, about this...
c00000 +++$+++ I went for four.
c00000 +++$+++ I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
c00000 +++$+++ Leave me alone, Conor.  Please.
c00000 +++$+++ There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
c00000 +++$+++ You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
c00000 +++$+++ I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
c00000 +++$+++ -- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
c00000 +++$+++ You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you.  Best thing in the world for you--carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me--goodnight!
c00000 +++$+++ No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
c00000 +++$+++ I didn't see any medical records in there.
c00000 +++$+++ We'll trust in faith, Gump.
c00000 +++$+++ You will wait?
c00000 +++$+++ Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
c00000 +++$+++ Pardon me, but why must I do you a favor?
c00000 +++$+++ With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
c00000 +++$+++ What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
c00000 +++$+++ Pretty bad.
c00000 +++$+++ What is the truth?
c00000 +++$+++ Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
c00000 +++$+++ There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
c00000 +++$+++ You found a flop!
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah. Come on--come on!
c00000 +++$+++ And what do you think you might have said?
c00000 +++$+++ Trust me. You asked me for help. Let me help. Trust me.
c00000 +++$+++ How?
c00000 +++$+++ That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
c00000 +++$+++ All you got to do is name it.
c00000 +++$+++ Really.
c00000 +++$+++ You didn't tell him about me?
c00000 +++$+++ I disagree.
c00000 +++$+++ He's dead.
c00000 +++$+++ Looks like you live in here, for Chrissake!
c00000 +++$+++ But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
c00000 +++$+++ I'm alone on this...
c00000 +++$+++ Quite a few.
c00000 +++$+++ If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
c00000 +++$+++ You bet we is!
c00000 +++$+++ Throw that money in the River! In THE RIVER!
c00000 +++$+++ If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
c00000 +++$+++ Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
c00000 +++$+++ Where's that?
c00000 +++$+++ Yes.  What do you think?
c00000 +++$+++ When?
c00000 +++$+++ Can't we change course?
c00000 +++$+++ Never heard of him.
c00000 +++$+++ Your father must be smart.
c00000 +++$+++ I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
c00000 +++$+++ Uh...yes, at the moment.
c00000 +++$+++ You may never remember at all. [Beat] Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
c00000 +++$+++ We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
c00000 +++$+++ Right next to the one you already had.
c00000 +++$+++ And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
c00000 +++$+++ Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
c00000 +++$+++ If she?
c00000 +++$+++ You teach them!
c00000 +++$+++ Treadstone?
c00000 +++$+++ Yah.
c00000 +++$+++ Do you have family here?
c00000 +++$+++ Michael.
c00000 +++$+++ You don't think he's mixed up in -
c00000 +++$+++ To cover up?
c00000 +++$+++ She'll think I betrayed her.
c00000 +++$+++ What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
c00000 +++$+++ We don't know what we're into!
c00000 +++$+++ Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
c00000 +++$+++ But "nice".
c00000 +++$+++ Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
c00000 +++$+++ We got engaged.
c00000 +++$+++ Seat's too high.
c00000 +++$+++ Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
c00000 +++$+++ And you?
c00000 +++$+++ ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
c00000 +++$+++ I have.
c00000 +++$+++ Can I have my gun back?
c00000 +++$+++ And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
c00000 +++$+++ Splendid, sir. No problems.
c00000 +++$+++ So what was he?
c00000 +++$+++ Hostages?
c00000 +++$+++ "The show must go on."
c00000 +++$+++ Yes, but.
c00000 +++$+++ Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
